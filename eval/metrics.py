    Compute the average concession size (in utility terms) for a single player's sequence of offers.
    
    Parameters:
        offers (list of lists/tuples/tensors): 
            Each element is an allocation for the player, e.g. how many units of each item

        valuations (list/tuple/tensor): 
            The player's values per unit of each item (same length as one offer).
