To do this, I need to calculate the value of each item type under the current offer and compare them with my private values.\n\nLet's calculate the value for each item type:\n- Item 1: 3 units * 57 = 171\n- Item 2: 2 units * 3 = 6\n- Item 3: 3 units * 100 = 300\n- Item 4: 3 units * 26 = 78\n- Item 5: 2 units * 91 = 182\n\nNow, let's compare these values with my private values:\n- Item 1: My value (57) is higher than the offer (171), so I would like to increase this amount.\n- Item 2: My value (3) is lower than the offer (6), so I would like to decrease this amount.\n- Item 3: My value (100) is equal to the offer (300), so it's not worth negotiating on.\n- Item 4: My value (26) is lower than the offer (78), so I would like to decrease this amount.\n- Item 5: My value (91) is higher than the offer (182), so I would like to increase this amount.\n\nGiven these calculations, my initial counteroffer should increase items 1 and 5 while decreasing items 2 and 4. \n\nHowever, since it's only Round 1, I need to be cautious and not overdo it, as Player 1 will have the opportunity to respond with a new offer in the next round. A balanced approach would be suitable.\n\nConsidering this, my counteroffer should aim to make some concessions while still prioritizing items that are most valuable to me based on my private values.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that tries to meet in the middle or slightly increases the amounts of item 1 and 5, while making moderate adjustments to other items. \n\nMy proposed counteroffer is:\n- Item 1: [3.7] (a 27% increase over the current offer)\n- Item 2: [1.8] (an 80% decrease from the current offer)\n- Item 3: [3]\n- Item 4: [2.9] (a 71.5% decrease from the current offer)\n- Item 5: [3.3] (an 68% increase over the current offer)\n\nThis approach aims to address some of my concerns while still giving Player 1 some room for counteroffer and negotiation.\n\nHowever, without knowing the actual value of player 1's outside offer or their reaction to this counteroffer, I cannot accurately make a final decision.\n\nSince I don't have any information about how Player 1 would react to these specific adjustments in this round and because there are so many factors at play here (including unknowns), the best response is to not overcommit too much without seeing player 1's potential offer, which could potentially negate some of my proposed gains.\n\nTherefore, a balanced approach for Round 1 that acknowledges uncertainty would be:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3.7, 1.8, 3, 2.9, 3.3]}\n\nThis counteroffer should give Player 1 an opportunity to respond with their own offer in the next round, allowing us both to better understand each other's positions and find a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nPlease note that this response is based on my initial analysis of the current situation and does not account for any potential strategies or reactions from Player 1.",

However, in Round 1, Player 2 also offered [3, 1, 3, 2, 3], which is an equally low offer. This suggests that neither player has a strong bargaining position.\n\nIn Round 2, Player 1 increased the offer to [4, 2, 3, 3, 2].

Since we don't have Player 1's private value, I will proceed with the calculation assuming a uniform distribution.\n   The present value of item 1 is (280 - x) / 1022 * 0.9^(1-1), where x is Player 1's private value.\n\n2.

Given my private values per unit of each item, I can calculate a weighted average value for each item type:\n\nItem 1: (38 units * $38) / 6 units = approximately $38.33 per unit\nItem 2: (20 units * $20) / 1 unit = $20 per unit\nItem 3: (29 units * $29) / 3 units = approximately $29.67 per unit\nItem 4: (18 units * $18) / 4 units = $13.50 per unit\nItem 5: (38 units * $38) / 7 units = approximately $30.57 per unit\n\nBased on these calculations, I would like to make an offer that reflects my relative values for each item type.\n\nMy initial offer is: [40, 10, 35, 15, 32]\n\nThis offer gives me a good balance of the items, considering their individual value to me. By making this offer, I hope to encourage Player 2 to make a counteroffer and potentially improve my overall outcome.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [40, 10, 35, 15, 32]}",

Therefore, the value of not receiving any units of Item 2 is 0.\n\nPlayer 2's total private outside offer is 172.\n\nMy initial reaction to Player 1's Round 1 offer [3, 0, 3, 1, 2] is that I should try to get as many units of items with high value for me. \n\nI notice that I could get more units of Item 4 and Item 5 by making a counteroffer without giving away units of Item 1 or Item 3. Let's analyze the values:\n\n- If I take 3 more units of Item 1, it gives Player 1 no benefits (0 * 8). However, losing only 2 units of Item 1 has a value of 16 (2 * 8).\n- If I give away some units of Item 4 and get those same units as part of the counteroffer, this will make me worse off because I lose 76 - x = gain from giving up these units. But if my outside offer is 172, losing a certain number of units (but not more than that) should still give me at least some benefit.\n- If I get more units of Item 5, it gives Player 1 no benefits (0 * 46). Losing only 2 units of Item 5 has a value of 92 (2 * 46).\n\nSince these offers have different impacts on each item type and my outside offer is relatively low (172), let's try to make the best counteroffer we can by finding the most valuable items that can be transferred. Let's look at which ones are the highest valued for player 1 given they already gave up a small number of units.\n\nAssuming Player 1 could give us some Item 4 and/or get even more units, this seems like a promising strategy. The lowest I want to sacrifice (while still giving away something of value) is 2 units of any item type.\n\n\n\nGiven these insights:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [16, 0, 0, 0, 92]}",

This is a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to my total value of all items (which is 496). My outside offer value is drawn randomly, so let's assume it is around the average of my total value. \n\nTo make a counteroffer or accept the current offer, I need to compare its value with my outside offer. If the current offer value is greater than my outside offer value, I will have an incentive to make a counteroffer.\n\nAssuming my outside offer value is approximately 220 (based on a uniform distribution), since it is less than the total value of all items and not close to the average, I can safely assume that the current offer value (195) is also below the average. Thus, I will have an incentive to make a counteroffer.\n\nHowever, given that this is round 1, I need to consider my private outside offer as well, which should be higher than the total value of all items because if it were not, walking away would be optimal for me in round 1 with such low current offer. But since we do not know Player 1's value or whether they will walk, and given that we can only respond to a round number of actions without direct interaction of values outside this system (other than through their stated offers), I must proceed under the assumption that my inside out offer should be considered with standard optimization rather than directly interacting with Player 1's private outside value.\n\nThe optimal action given these considerations would typically depend on Player 1's next move, which is not provided here. However, considering the constraints of this system and the limited information about future moves by Player 1 (i.e., we cannot interact with their outside offer), I will proceed as if I were only optimizing for the current round based on what is available.\n\nGiven these considerations, my optimal action in Round 1 would be to make a COUNTEROFFER.

                    "response": "To determine my action in Round 2, I will follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the current offer value without discounting.\nThe current offer is [1, 2, 5, 0, 4]. Since there are 2 units of item 1 and each unit has a value of 9 to me, the value contribution from item 1 is 18. Similarly, for items 2-5, their values contribute as follows: 108 (item 2), 48 (item 3), 0 (item 4), and 150 (item 5) respectively.\n\nStep 2: Calculate my private outside offer value.\nMy total value of all items is 928. My outside offer was drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to this total value, so I can calculate the probability density function of this distribution but without knowing the exact value, we cannot determine my specific offer. However, since the value range is between 1 and 928, it's worth noting that an average outside offer might be closer to half of the range (464), considering a uniform distribution.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate Player 2's action in Round 1.\nIn Round 1, Player 2 offered [1, 2, 5, 0, 4], which is close to my private values for items 2 and 3. This means that if I were to accept this offer, I would receive fewer units of these items than I value them.\n\nStep 4: Determine the potential outcome of accepting the current offer.\nIf I accept the current offer [1, 2, 5, 0, 4], I will end up with 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2 (since Player 2 offered 2 but I have a higher value for each unit), 7 units of item 3 (which is acceptable given the lower value for this item), 0 units of item 4 (which is also acceptable since it has no demand from me), and 6 units of item 5. The total value contribution to me would be (18 + 108 + 48 + 150) = 324.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the discount rate effect.\nGiven that we are in Round 2, the discount factor is gamma = 0.9 raised to the power (2-1) = 0.9. If I were to accept this offer, my future value of receiving these items would be multiplied by this discount factor.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the potential outcomes.\nSince Player 2 offered a relatively close-to-fair distribution in Round 1, but I did not counteroffer because I was unsure about their private values and needed more information to make an informed decision. Given my outside offer is lower than the current offer's value contribution (324), accepting this deal seems reasonable.\n\nStep 7: Determine my action.\nGiven that the current offer provides a higher total value to me compared to my own private outside offer, I will choose to accept the offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

On the other hand, if they're unwilling to part with any units of item 2 or 5, that's more in my favor.\n\nGiven the lack of information and the need to make a strategic decision based on potential future offers, I will make an initial offer that tries to balance fairness and leverage. Since Player 2 has the most items (7 units), I might want to start with a proposal that gives them something they can't refuse.\n\nHere's my initial offer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 1, 1, 3]}",

Since the private values are drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 101, we can assume that they are approximately normally distributed with mean and standard deviation equal to their respective values (60, 31, 25, 31, 51).\n\nI will first calculate the value of each item type for me (Player 2):\nItem 1: 4 units x 60 = 240\nItem 2: 3 units x 31 = 93\nItem 3: 1 unit x 25 = 25\nItem 4: 0 units x 31 = 0\nItem 5: 2 units x 51 = 102\n\nThe total value of my items is approximately 460.\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of each item type for Player 1:\nItem 1: 1 unit x unknown value (will be determined by their private offer)\nItem 2: 4 units x unknown value\nItem 3: 1 unit x unknown value\nItem 4: 0 units x unknown value\nItem 5: 3 units x unknown value\n\nSince Player 1's private outside offer is drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to their total value of all items, we can assume that their total value is approximately the average of their item values. However, since we don't know Player 1's private values for each item type, I will proceed with my analysis using only the information provided.\n\nNext, let's evaluate the current offer on the table:\nItem 1: 3 units\nItem 2: 5 units\nItem 3: 1 unit\nItem 4: 0 units\nItem 5: 4 units\n\nThe total value of this offer is approximately 13.\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of each item type for me (Player 2) if I accept this offer:\nItem 1: 3 units x 60 = 180\nItem 2: 5 units x 31 = 155\nItem 3: 1 unit x 25 = 25\nItem 4: 0 units x 31 = 0\nItem 5: 4 units x 51 = 204\n\nThe total value of this offer is approximately 604.\n\nComparing the values, I can see that accepting this offer results in a higher total value for me (604) than if I walk away with my private outside offer (460).\n\nHowever, since I need to consider Player 1's perspective as well, let's analyze their possible reaction. If Player 1 accepts this offer, they will receive a lower total value than if they had made a better counteroffer.\n\nGiven the current information and the fact that we are in Round 2, it is likely that Player 1 wants to make another counteroffer. This suggests that I should not accept the current offer and instead consider making a counteroffer of my own.\n\nMy counteroffer should take into account the values of each item type for both players and be strategic enough to deter Player 1 from making a better counteroffer in Round 3.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will make the following action:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 0, 0, 3]}",

However, without explicit values for Player 2, I will proceed with the assumption that their outside offer value might be lower than mine.\n\nGiven these considerations, my initial thought is to make an initial counteroffer rather than walking away or accepting any potential offer from Player 2.

Since this is a multi-item negotiation, I will aim for a balanced offer that takes into account my private values.\n\nAssuming a fair distribution of items based on their quantities and my private values, I estimate the following offer:\n\n- Item 1: 3 units\n- Item 2: 5 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 5 units\n- Item 5: 4 units\n\nThis is a total of 20 units.

                    "response": "To determine my action in this round, I will follow the negotiation strategy.\n\nFirst, let's compute the value of each item being offered by player 2. This can be done by multiplying each quantity by player 1's private values and summing these up:\n\nValue of [3, 5, 0, 4, 3] is:\n(28*3) + (77*5) + (6*0) + (78*4) + (61*3) = \n84 + 385 + 0 + 312 + 183 = 764\n\nNow we need to compute the value of each item being offered by player 2. This can be done by multiplying each quantity by my private values and summing these up:\n\nValue of [3, 5, 0, 4, 3] is:\n(28*3) + (77*5) + (6*0) + (78*4) + (61*3) = \n84 + 385 + 0 + 312 + 183 = 764\n\nSince the value of each item being offered to me is the same as my private values multiplied by the quantity, and I can get a higher value per unit if I give player 2 more items of certain types (item 1), I should offer a counteroffer that provides less quantity of those types.\n\nLet's determine which types would provide the most value per unit. We need to compute the value per unit for each item type:\n\nValue per unit for item 1 is: \n(28/3) = 9.33\nValue per unit for item 2 is: \n(77/5) = 15.4\nValue per unit for item 3 is: \n(6/0) = Not defined (we can not get a value per unit here, so we will ignore it)\nValue per unit for item 4 is: \n(78/4) = 19.5\nValue per unit for item 5 is: \n(61/3) = 20.33\n\nThe items with the lowest values per unit are item 1 and item 2, as they provide more value to me if I get less quantity of them.\n\nTo maximize my share in each round, I will offer less quantity of these types (item 1) while giving away equal quantity of other types (item 3 and item 5).\n\nThe counteroffer can be computed by finding the ratio of values per unit for item 1 to the value per unit of items that player 2 can get more units of, which is approximately [19.5 / 20.33]. Let's round this down to the nearest integer and use it as a multiplier.\n\nFor item 3: \n(28 * (19.5/20.33)) = approximately 27.65\nSince we need to give less quantity of item 1, I will set this value close to zero.\nSo, [3*0, 77*4, 6*2, 78*3, 61*3] is a counteroffer.\n\nTo verify that my proposed counteroffer improves the overall value per unit for me relative to what player 2 has offered:\n(28*0) + (77*4) + (6*2) + (78*3) + (61*3) = \n0 + 308 + 12 + 234 + 183 = 737 \n\nThe value of my proposed counteroffer per unit is lower than what player 2 had offered. Let's now compare it to the current offer on the table, which was [3, 5, 0, 4, 3].\n\nComparing these two values:\n(28*0) + (77*4) + (6*2) + (78*3) + (61*3) = \n737 \n\nwith\n(28*3) + (77*5) + (6*0) + (78*4) + (61*3) = \n764\n\nThe proposed counteroffer improves the value per unit by a factor of 1.0078.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer to improve my value per unit while giving away some units of other types in exchange:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 2, 3, 3]}",

However, this is an assumption and not based on actual data.\n\nNow let's consider the possible actions:\n\n- WALK: If I walk away, my share of the items will be (1/5) * total value, which would be close to (1/5) * 1179 = 235.8 units.\n- A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...]: As the first player, it's better for me to propose an initial offer that gets closer to my private outside offer value of 409.\n\nSince I have a total of 1179 units and want to end up with close to this value, I would like to make an offer that gets me around 90% of this value (close to the midpoint of the distribution).\n\nBased on this strategy, I will propose an initial offer that consists of:\n\n(n1 = 90/4 * total items per item type) = [91.5, 27, 20.25, 10.5, 6]\n\nMy action in round 1 is thus:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [91.5, 27, 20.25, 10.5, 6]}",

Since both offers are drawn from a uniform random distribution between 1 and their total value of all items, we need to assume that Player 2's outside offer will be slightly lower than mine due to the smaller total value.\n\nAssuming Player 2's outside offer has a probability of being higher than mine with a certain probability p. Then, in this round, I should make an initial offer such that it is close to my private outside offer.\n\nI'll assume my outside offer value (493) and calculate the probability p as follows: \nLet x be Player 2's outside offer value.\nLet y be my outside offer value.\nx has a uniform distribution between 1 and 1187 (Player 2's total value), while y has a uniform distribution between 1 and 1191 (my total value).\nThe probability of my outside offer being higher than Player 2's outside offer can be calculated as follows: \np = (y - 1) / (y + x - 2)\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\np = (493 - 1) / (493 + 1187 - 2)\np \u2248 0.98\n\nNow, let's assume Player 2's outside offer value is around half of my total value for this round. Let x be approximately equal to 595.\nThe probability p can be calculated as follows: \np = (493 - 1) / (493 + 595 - 2)\np \u2248 0.98\n\nTo make an initial offer, I'll use the formula for a fair division of items between two players, assuming both players are indifferent to the outcome.\n\nThe number of units each player receives can be calculated as follows:\nn1 = (440 * p) / ((p + x - 2) + (1 - p))\n= (440 * 0.98) / ((0.98 + 595 - 2) + (1 - 0.98))\n\u2248 220\n\nn2 = ((1191 - 440) * p) / ((p + x - 2) + (1 - p))\n= ((750 * 0.98) / ((0.98 + 595 - 2) + (1 - 0.98)))\n\u2248 370\n\nNow, I can make an initial offer.\n\nInitial offer: [220, 0, 292, 495, 64]\n\nSince this is not a single number but rather multiple values, we need to adjust our approach for the response format requirements. A more suitable format would be:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [220, 0, 292, 495, 64]}\n\nHowever, given the constraints and for simplicity, I will treat this as a WALK to ensure compliance with the required action format.\n\n {\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

To determine whether to make an initial offer, I need to consider Player 2's potential response and the overall outcome.\n\nPlayer 2's value per unit for each item is unknown at this stage, but their total value (6 units of item 1 + 3 units of item 2 + 6 units of item 3 + 2 units of item 4 + 4 units of item 5 = 21 units) is lower than mine (6 units of item 1 + 3 units of item 2 + 6 units of item 3 + 2 units of item 4 + 4 units of item 5 = 21 units), which suggests that they may be more willing to compromise on the division of items.\n\nGiven this information, I will make an initial offer. Let's assume I want to give a certain number of units of each item to Player 2. A reasonable starting point might be to offer half of each item type, but this could be adjusted based on future negotiations and Player 2's response.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, let's consider my initial offer as [3, 1.5, 3, 1, 2]. This is a relatively even distribution, taking into account the quantities available for each item type.\n\nNow that I have made an initial offer, it's essential to monitor Player 2's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nGiven this information, I will provide my action as:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1.5, 3, 1, 2]}",

Since item 3 has a high value for me but is offered with only 3 units (the same number as my private value), it might be reasonable to hold out on this one and focus on negotiating better deals elsewhere.\n\nMy initial counteroffer could include taking more of the lower-value items or trying to get some more of the higher-value items.

However, accepting the offer might lead to future rounds where Player 1 could make more favorable offers due to their potential for a higher outside offer.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will analyze what happens if I make a counteroffer and compare it to accepting or walking away.\n\nAssuming I provide a valid counteroffer [n1, n2, ...] in this round, the values of each item in that counteroffer are multiplied by my private value for that item, which would be:\n\n- Item 1: [n1 * 82]\n- Item 2: [n2 * 100]\n- Item 3: [n3 * 60]\n- Item 4: [n4 * 3]\n- Item 5: [n5 * 72]\n\nConsidering the constraints of this round, I must find numbers n1 through n5 such that their sum does not exceed the number of items available (2+2+4+2+3=13), which is a feasible condition given Player 1's last offer. Since my goal is to maximize my value in each item type and considering the discount factor, I should aim for distributing my items as close to my private values as possible.\n\nHowever, since we only have three rounds available, it might be prudent to use this round to gather more information about Player 1's preferences or make a strategic decision that sets me up well for future rounds. Given the offer and my outside value, walking away is not an immediately attractive option without further analysis of the potential values in subsequent rounds.\n\nTherefore, considering all factors, I will choose to make a counteroffer with numbers [n1, n2, ...] that are as close to my private values as possible while staying within reason. This should allow me to gather information and potentially set up future negotiations in a favorable light for myself.\n\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 4, 3, 3]}",

This means I will get 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nPlayer 1's total value is also unknown to me. However, their private outside offer range is from 1 to the total value of all items they have (which I don't know).\n\nMy private outside offer value, which ranges from 1 to my total value of all items (154), is 47.\n\nNow, considering the current offer [0, 3, 2, 3, 2], if I were to accept it, I would get a total of 10 units of items. However, I can calculate the overall value of this outcome using my private values per unit of each item:\n\nValue = (61 * 0) + (7 * 3) + (19 * 2) + (63 * 3) + (4 * 2) \n       = 0 + 21 + 38 + 189 + 8\n       = 256\n\nSince this value is greater than my private outside offer of 47, I would benefit from a better deal. However, if I were to make a counteroffer and Player 1 accepts it, the overall outcome will be more favorable for me.\n\nNext, let's consider making a counteroffer. The discount rate gamma = 0.9, which implies that the overall value of the negotiation to each player decreases as the number of rounds increases.\n\nTo maximize my chances of getting a better deal, I need to make an offer that is neither too high nor too low.

As Player 1, I have a private outside offer value drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 618, which is approximately 24. However, this value doesn't directly inform my first-round action because I'm starting a new negotiation.\n\nMy goal in the first round is to create an incentive for Player 2 to make a move and respond to my offer. Given that there are no items to divide yet, I'll need to think about what would motivate Player 2 to accept or reject a proposed division.\n\nConsidering the values of each item and their quantities, I have a total value of all items: 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 7 = 17 units. Since my private outside offer is relatively low at approximately 24, it's not clear how much I'm willing to give up initially.\n\nTo create an incentive for Player 2 to respond, I'll propose a division of the items that balances my own interests with creating some room for negotiation. Given my private values, I'll aim to allocate items in a way that ensures both players get something of value from the negotiation.\n\nAssuming equal splits are possible and assuming Player 2's perspective (assuming their outside offer is drawn similarly), I propose an initial division as follows:\n\n- Item 1: (3 + 3) / 2 = 3 units\n- Item 2: (3 + 3) / 2 = 3 units\n- Item 3: (1 + 0) / 2 = 0.5 units\n- Item 4: (3 + 0) / 2 = 1.5 units\n- Item 5: (7 + 0) / 2 = 3.5 units\n\nThis division ensures that both players get a substantial amount of each item, while also giving me the flexibility to adjust my offer in subsequent rounds based on Player 2's response.\n\nGiven this proposed division and considering it as an initial offer, I'll respond with:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 0.5, 1.5, 3.5]}",

This is crucial in determining the value I place on these offers.\n\n3. **Outside Offers**: My outside offer value is 1460, and Player 1's would be similarly drawn from their total value of all items. Since both players' private values are higher than their respective outside offer values, it indicates that both are willing to give up some value in the negotiation if they can reach a better deal.\n\n4. **Discount Rate**: The discount rate gamma = 0.9 means that the longer the negotiation lasts, the less valuable each item becomes.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- Accepting this extremely low offer without any counteroffer would be foolish, as it would benefit Player 1 greatly at my expense.\n  \n- Walking away (WALK) immediately after seeing such an offer might seem reasonable but doesn't give me a chance to negotiate further and could potentially leave more value on the table than what I currently have.\n\n- Making a COUNTEROFFER would allow me to negotiate, possibly gaining more favorable terms for myself. Given that Player 1 has offered very few items initially, a counteroffer can serve as an opportunity to adjust their offer in my favor while still giving them some of the items they've offered so far.\n\nConsidering these options and the information available:\n\nGiven my outside offer value is 1460, I should aim to negotiate a more favorable distribution. Since Player 1 has started with very low offers, attempting to increase these numbers could be beneficial.\n\n**My Action**: {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5]} - where x1, x2, ..., x5 represent the number of units I would offer to Player 1 as part of a counteroffer, considering my need to increase the value while still giving them some items.\n\nGiven the format required for the response and without specifying exact numbers for each item in the counteroffer, it is technically invalid to provide an answer that includes specific values.

If I were to make an initial offer with a chance at higher overall gain, it would be beneficial to do so.\n\nGiven that I don't have enough information about Player 2's private values or their private outside offer, and without any specific target value or the ability to negotiate towards a mutually acceptable division of items, my decision in Round 1 is based on maximizing potential future gains by offering something. However, this approach is speculative since I do not know Player 2's private outside offer.\n\nTherefore, considering these factors, I will make an initial offer to Player 2 without knowing their counteroffer value for simplicity and strategic uncertainty. A reasonable first offer could be a minimal division of items in hopes of negotiating further, given the unknown private offers. \n\nGiven my available options and the lack of clear information about what might occur after Round 1, I will make an initial offer to Player 2 by specifying two numbers that represent the quantity of each item type being offered (though the precise values are speculative).\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 2, 1, 2]}",

Therefore, I will choose a counteroffer that includes at least some value for these items.\n\nTo calculate my optimal counteroffer, I need to find the maximum amount of money I can get from Player 1 without giving away too much. Since we know Player 1's outside offer is drawn from a uniform distribution ranging from 1 to their total private value, let's call this value x. We want to maximize our expected payoff given this constraint.\n\nGiven that each item has a different number of units and I have different private values for each item, I will prioritize the items with higher private values per unit. My priority order is: item 5, item 4, item 3, item 2, item 1.\n\nTo maximize our expected payoff, I want to give Player 1 as much of these high-priority items as possible without giving away too many units of each item. Since we are in round 2 and the offer is [0, 3, 2, 1, 5], let's start with reducing the quantity of item 3 by 1 unit to see if it increases our expected payoff.\n\nGiven that I have a high private value for item 3 (8) per unit, giving away only 1 unit reduces my total private value by 8. However, since the current offer is [0, 3, 2, 1, 5], reducing the quantity of item 3 by 1 unit to 1 will give me a higher quantity of other items (item 4 and item 5) than I currently have.\n\nHere's my reasoning for reducing the quantity of each item:\n\n* Item 1: Reducing this quantity from 2 to 0 means I'll get no units of this item.\n* Item 2: Reducing this quantity from 3 to 0 means I'll give away all of this item.\n* Item 3: Reducing this quantity from 2 to 1 gives me the high-value item with the lowest number of units, allowing me to reduce my total private value by 8 (2 * 4 = 8).\n* Item 4: Keeping this quantity at 1 means I'll give away only one unit of this item.\n* Item 5: Reducing this quantity from 5 to 4 gives me a moderate-value item with the highest number of units, allowing me to reduce my total private value by 20 (8 * 2.5 = 20).\n\nBased on these calculations, I will make the following counteroffer:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 4]}",

Then, we'll use these values to calculate the present value of the outcome for Player 1, taking into account the discount factor.\n\nFor Round 4:\n\n1. Current Offer: [2, 0, 3, 1, 6]\n2. Private Values:\n   - Item 1: 37 (my value) / 2 = 18.5\n   - Item 2: 8 (my value) / 0 = N/A\n   - Item 3: 62 (my value) / 3 = 20.67\n   - Item 4: 26 (my value) / 1 = 26\n   - Item 5: 74 (my value) / 6 = 12.33\n\nSince Item 2 has no units offered, its value is undefined in the context of this round.\n\n3. Discount Factor for Round 4: gamma^3 (since we're on Round 4)\n\nNow, let's assume Player 2 didn't make a counteroffer in Round 3 or walked away, so we can use their original offer to calculate the present value.\n\nThe values from previous rounds are not directly relevant here since the new round is independent of them. The only information that matters for this step is the current round and my options.\n\nGiven the value of each item type in this round:\n- Item 1: 18.5\n- Item 2: N/A (not applicable)\n- Item 3: 20.67\n- Item 4: 26\n- Item 5: 12.33\n\nPlayer 2's offer is [2, 0, 3, 1, 6], meaning they're offering 2 units of item 1 and nothing else.\n\nConsidering my private values for items that are being offered in this round (item 1, item 4, and partially item 5), I need to decide if I should accept, counteroffer, or walk away.\n\nSince accepting the current offer directly doesn't help me much due to Item 2's value being undefined, let's look at counteroffering. However, without knowing Player 2's private values for each item type and how they would be adjusted by their outside offers, making an informed counteroffer is challenging but potentially valuable if it can increase my gain significantly.\n\nSince the current offer includes items I care about (item 1, item 4), and considering the lack of information on how Player 2's private values for those items could influence this round, a simple acceptance or rejection would be difficult to decide based solely on value comparisons. However, given that we are at Round 4 without any clear information on future offers from either player and assuming both players have reached their outside offers (which is not explicitly stated but implied by the lack of further offers), it seems reasonable for me to consider counteroffering as a way to try to improve my position based on this round's values.\n\nBut since I don't have Player 2's private value distribution or how their outside offer affects their valuation of items, directly calculating an optimal counteroffer without more information becomes speculative.\n\nGiven the above analysis and lack of specificity about Player 2's decision-making process for their side of the negotiation in Round 4 (or any round), I'll opt to make a conservative move that tries to secure some value from the current offer by adjusting my response.\n\nGiven these considerations, my response is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 2, 1, 5]}",

To evaluate this offer, we need to calculate the total value of the items that Player 2 would receive if they accepted this offer:\n   - Item 1: 3 units x 31 (Player 2's private value) = 93\n   - Item 2: 0 units x 31 = 0\n   - Item 3: 0 units x 27 = 0\n   - Item 4: 2 units x 15 = 30\n   - Item 5: 3 units x 57 = 171\n\nThe total value of the items that Player 2 would receive is 93 + 0 + 0 + 30 + 171 = 294.\n\n4. Now, let's calculate the total value of all items:\n   - Total item value = (9 x 63) + (4 x 31) + (2 x 27) + (3 x 15) + (5 x 57)\n                 = 567 + 124 + 54 + 45 + 285\n                 = 979\n\nSince the total value of all items is greater than the total value of the items that Player 2 would receive in this offer, we can conclude that Player 1's initial offer was not generous enough.\n\n5. We need to evaluate our private outside offer value (500) and compare it with Player 2's potential private outside offer value. However, without knowing Player 2's private outside offer value, we cannot directly compare them.\n\n6. Since the game is in Round 2 and Player 1 has already offered a specific proposal, we should consider making a counteroffer to try to improve our position.\n\n7. Based on our private values, we want to maximize the quantity of item types with high private values (item 5) for ourselves.\n\n8.

The total value of all items is 828.\n\nLet's calculate the maximum possible units for each item type based on the distribution:\n- Item 1: Since there are 3 units available, and assuming a roughly uniform distribution, we can estimate this to be around 1 unit.\n- Item 2: 3 units available\n- Item 3: 3 units available\n- Item 4: 3 units available\n- Item 5: 6 units available\n\nNow, considering my private outside offer value of 588 and the total value of all items (828), I will make an initial offer to Player 2.\n\nInitial Offer:\n- [1, 3, 3, 3, 4]\n\nThis offer allows me to keep some units of each item type while giving away a portion of them.

Since this is round 1 and there are a total of 3 rounds, the factor becomes ((1 - 0.9)^2).\nTotal value of outside offer = 1368 * ((1-0.9)^2) \u2248 625.\n\nMy private outside offer is drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to my total value of all items, which is 1368. Therefore, I can generate an offer as follows:\nOutside offer (to myself): \nUniform Distribution (U(1, 1368)): \nMean =  (1 + 1368) / 2 = 1368.5\nStandard Deviation: sqrt((1368)^2 - (1368.5)^2)/1368 \u2248 0.0273 * 1368.5\nRandom Value (Uniform Distribution): \nMean: ~1368.5\n Standard Deviation: ~0.0273 * 1368.5\n\nI will generate a random value within this range to determine my private outside offer value, which is approximately: 1369.\n\nNow, I have the total value of all items, the total value of my outside offer, and my private outside offer value. To make an initial counteroffer, I need to consider Player 2's private values for each item type.\n\nHowever, since we do not know Player 2's private values or offers, let us proceed with generating an optimal initial counteroffer based on our own available information. Since both players are unknown and lack their respective values, a counteroffer will have to be made without knowing what other player knows about the items. I must then make my best guess.\n\nConsidering only Player 1's private values, an optimal initial offer is generated by dividing each item type into units that would lead to a fair distribution given our value for each unit (since we are unaware of the value of the other party's outside offers or personal values). The goal is to make a counteroffer as close to this fair distribution as possible.\n\nLet us calculate how many units of each item should be offered in order to achieve an equal distribution based on our own private values:\n\n1. Item 1: Since we have three items, and their value per unit is high (84), I must divide these into a number that balances the higher-value items while also making sense for both parties.\n\n2. Item 2: Similarly, since it has two units with a lower value compared to item one (57), the quantity of this should be adjusted accordingly in order to balance our private values.\n\n3. Item 3: Having four items with a high value per unit (94) indicates that these must also be divided evenly.\n\n4. Item 4 and item 5: Given their respective lower values, they can be offered at different ratios compared to the other items while maintaining an equal distribution for the total quantity of items received by both parties.\n\nGiven the lack of information about Player 2's private values or offers, a balanced counteroffer without further knowledge is difficult. Therefore, based on my own values and considering the constraints above, I propose the following:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]} \n\nPlease note this may not be optimal in terms of balancing both parties' private values or outside offers.",

This is not an optimal strategy in general, but given the lack of information, it's a reasonable step.\n\nI propose to increase my initial offer for some items while keeping others constant, aiming to create an imbalance without having specific knowledge about Player 2's preferences. However, I must remember that any counteroffer should be based on actual numbers, not just hypothetical increments.\n\nLet's start with item 1 and adjust the quantities accordingly:\n\nInitially, I had 0 units of item 1 in my offer, but since Player 1 started with only one unit, let's increment it by 2 to get a better understanding of the game. However, we can't directly add more than the remaining items' total. We need to balance this within our constraints.\n\n\nGiven that I'm starting from an initial incorrect approach for balancing without information on values, I will adjust according to common negotiation strategies in games like these:\n\n- Increase the units for high-value items you want less of, but keep in mind the balance and discount factor.\n- Since we're at round 2, a strategic adjustment might be more beneficial than walking away or immediately accepting.\n\nIn a normal negotiation game without knowing Player 2's values, my first instinct would be to slightly decrease one side of the offer to encourage counteroffers from them. However, since we must adhere to the strict format for responses, I will adjust according to the instructions provided and simplify this to:\n\nSince I do not have direct access to information on the optimal strategy in this scenario without more specific knowledge about Player 2's values or willingness to negotiate further, I'll proceed with caution.\n\n\nGiven that my first attempt at explaining reasoning was not fully accurate for a negotiation game like this and considering we need a precise action:\n\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]}",

To calculate the estimated total value of this offer to Player 2, I'll apply the discount rate gamma = 0.9:\nValue = \u03b3^(r-1) * ((n1*v + n2*56 + n3*59 + n4*42 + n5*57), where r = 2 and v is approximately the midpoint of the distribution (51).\nValue \u2248 0.9^1 * ((1*51 + 0*56 + 1*59 + 2*42 + 1*57))\nValue \u2248 0.9 * (151)\nValue \u2248 136.1\n\nThe estimated value of this offer to me, considering the discount rate and my private values, is approximately 300 - 136.1 = 163.9.\n\nNow I will compare these two estimates:\n\n- Estimated value if I choose ACCEPT: 163.9\n- Value if I choose COUNTEROFFER or WALK: varies greatly\n\nGiven that Player 1 made a lower offer than the one I received in Round 1, and considering my estimated values for both options, I feel that negotiating further is likely to result in a better outcome for me.\n\nMy action in this round is to make a counteroffer.

Since Player 2's total value is unknown, I can only estimate it based on the quantities they are willing to offer me. In Round 1, I have no information about their current offer, so I will use a rough estimate.\n\nLet's assume that Player 2 offers me an equal share of all items (which may not be accurate). The total quantity is 2 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 20 units. If they offer me an equal share, my expected value from this offer would be:\n\n(2/20) * 92 + (5/20) * 53 + (3/20) * 90 + (5/20) * 62 + (5/20) * 62 = 46.6 + 13.25 + 22.5 + 15.5 + 15.5 = 114.2\n\nSince my expected outside offer value is 670, I will choose to continue negotiating if my expected value from continuing is greater than my expected outside offer value.\n\nNow, let's compare the expected values:\n\n670 (expected outside offer) > 114.2 (expected value from continuing)\n\nI do not want to receive an average of 670 by choosing WALK, so I will continue negotiating.\n\nSince I have a rough estimate of Player 2's current offer and my expected value from continuing is greater than my expected outside offer value, I will make a counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

The average value would be ((9+61+82+99+18)/5) = 53.8 per unit.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [6, 0, 3, 4, 5]. To determine if I should ACCEPT, COUNTEROFFER, or WALK, let's calculate the total value of each item type under both our individual valuations and the current offer:\n\n- Item 1: My valuation = 7 * 9 = 63. Player 1's valuation = 6 * 53.8 = 321.8. Current offer - My valuation = 6 * (53.8 - 9) = 306. The difference between my value and the current offer is $36.\n\n- Item 2: My valuation = 2 * 61 = 122. Player 1's valuation = 0 * 53.8 = 0. Current offer - My valuation = 0 * (53.8 - 61) = 0. The difference between my value and the current offer is -$61.\n\n- Item 3: My valuation = 3 * 82 = 246. Player 1's valuation = 3 * 53.8 = 161.9. Current offer - My valuation = 3 * (53.8 - 82) = -141.9. The difference between my value and the current offer is -$388.\n\n- Item 4: My valuation = 6 * 16.5 = 99. Player 1's valuation = 4 * 53.8 = 214.4. Current offer - My valuation = 4 * (53.8 - 16.5) = 133.2. The difference between my value and the current offer is $34.\n\n- Item 5: My valuation = 6 * 3 = 18. Player 1's valuation = 5 * 53.8 = 269. Current offer - My valuation = 5 * (53.8 - 3) = 247. The difference between my value and the current offer is $229.\n\nBased on these calculations, I can see that Item 2 has a significant negative value for me ($61), which suggests that Player 1's valuation might be higher than mine for this item type. However, since we don't know their exact valuations, let's proceed with caution and consider the overall distribution of values.\n\nGiven the high value of Item 5 in my favor and the significantly lower value of Item 2, I will make a counteroffer to adjust these imbalances:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 1, 3, 4, 6]}",

Since this is my second round, I need to evaluate whether accepting or counteroffering would be better for me.\n\n4. The discount rate gamma = 0.9, and the negotiation will conclude after three rounds.\n\n5. To calculate my private outside offer value, we first need to know that your total value of all items is 835 (6 + 24 + 5 + 51 + 35 = 101 * 8.25), so your outside offer was drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 835, and it was 38.\n\n6. To calculate my private outside offer value, we first need to know that your total value of all items is 835 (6 + 24 + 5 + 51 + 35 = 101 * 8.25), so my outside offer was drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 835, and it was 38.\n\n7. Let's calculate the expected values of each item type based on Player 2's private values:\n   - Item 1: (2 units * 6 per unit) = 12\n   - Item 2: (4 units * 24 per unit) = 96\n   - Item 3: (5 units * 5 per unit) = 25\n   - Item 4: (6 units * 51 per unit) = 306\n   - Item 5: (7 units * 35 per unit) = 245\n\n8.

Given that the total number of units in each item type in Player 2's current proposal are low for both of us (e.g., less than half), a counteroffer could result in me getting more value from each item type, allowing me to accept an improved deal or even walk away if I can get better terms.\n\nConsidering these factors, my next step would be:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 5, 6, 8, 9]}",

Therefore, their total value is also 1066.\n\n2. Calculate my outside offer's value:\n   - $656\n\n3. Calculate the discounted value for round 1 (gamma = 0.9):\n   - Round 1 value: ($2304 x 48) + ($4900 x 70) + ($2704 x 52) + ($169 x 13) + ($2106 x 46)\n   - Discounted value: $2304 * 0.9^1 + $4900 * 0.9^1 + $2704 * 0.9^1 + $169 * 0.9^1 + $2106 * 0.9^1\n   - Discounted value for round 1: approximately $1039.49\n\n4.

Given that my outside offer's value ($656) is much lower than the current offer's average value per unit (approximately $206.14), and considering the lack of information about Player 2's private values, it would be reasonable for me to consider making a counteroffer in order to potentially improve the deal.\n\nHowever, without knowing Player 2's exact preferences or outside offer value, I will attempt to make an educated guess by trying to find a middle ground that is somewhat favorable to both of us. Since the current offer already has high units of items 3 and 5, I may try to reduce those quantities while still keeping the other item quantities roughly balanced.\n\nGiven this information, my counteroffer would be to decrease the quantity of item 5 by 1 unit (resulting in 4 units) while increasing the quantity of item 1 by 1 unit (resulting in 3 units), and leaving the quantities of items 2, 3, and 4 unchanged:\n\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 3, 2, 3]}",

The total value of the items for Player 1 is:\n(48/4) * 2 + (70/2) * 3 + (52/6) * 4 + (13/4) * 1 + (46/5) * 2 = 12 + 105 + 26.67 + 3.25 + 18.4 = 165\n\nThe total value of the items for Player 2 is:\n(48/4) * 3 + (70/2) * 2 + (52/6) * 1 + (13/4) * 2 + (46/5) * 4 = 12 + 70 + 8.67 + 6.25 + 23.2 = 120\n\nPlayer 1's private outside offer value is 656, and Player 2's private outside offer value is:\n(48/4) * 3 + (70/2) * 2 + (52/6) * 1 + (13/4) * 4 + (46/5) * 1 = 12 + 70 + 8.67 + 10.25 + 9.2 = 100.12\nHowever, Player 2 does not know this value.\n\nNow, let's consider the discount rate gamma = 0.9. If the process concludes after r rounds (3 in this case), the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1). \n\nSince this is Player 1's last round and Player 2 has not made a counteroffer, it would be optimal for Player 1 to try to secure the highest possible deal that does not cause Player 2 to walk away.\n\nHowever, since we do know Player 2's outside value (100.12), we can analyze what they might be looking for in terms of their outside offer. If Player 2 were able to get an even better offer than what is on the table, it would likely mean that the current deal was worse for them.\n\nThe total value of items offered on the table (for Player 1) is:\n2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 12\n\nIf we try to allocate this total value across all items without regard to their individual values, each item would get an equal share. However, since we know that the private outside offer of Player 1 (656) is higher than what could be achieved by simply allocating an equal share, it's likely that Player 2 wants more.\n\nHowever, given that this negotiation has now reached its final round, and there is no indication that Player 2 would make a counteroffer to take advantage of their outside offer in this case, we should consider the current deal from Player 1's perspective.\n\nGiven the total value available (1066), and considering the private values for each item type, I think it is rational for me to accept the deal. The allocation of [2,3,4,1,2] may not be optimal, but given that we are in the final round, and there's no reason to believe Player 2 will make a counteroffer now, this seems like a reasonable offer.\n\nThus, my action is:\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

                    "response": "To determine my action in this round, let's first calculate the value of each item under the current offer.\n\nItem 1: You have 5 units, and Player 1 offers 3. The total value of these items is 92 * 3 + 92 * (5 - 3) = 276 + 184 = 460.\nItem 2: You have 5 units, and Player 1 offers 4. The total value of these items is 59 * 4 + 59 * (5 - 4) = 236 + 59 = 295.\nItem 3: You have 4 units, and Player 1 offers 2. The total value of these items is 52 * 2 + 52 * (4 - 2) = 104 + 88 = 192.\nItem 4: Player 1 offers 0 units, so the total value of this item is 0.\nItem 5: You have 2 units, and Player 1 offers 1. The total value of these items is 67 * 1 + 67 * (2 - 1) = 67 + 67 = 134.\n\nNow, let's calculate the present value of the current offer, taking into account the discount factor gamma = 0.9 and the number of rounds completed so far (rounds = 1).\nPresent Value of Offer = \u03b3^(r-1) * \u03a3(v_i \\* n_i), where v_i is your private value for item i and n_i is the quantity of item i being offered.\nPresent Value of Offer \u2248 0.9^0 \\* (460 + 295 + 192 + 134) \u2248 881.\n\nNext, let's calculate my outside offer value. Since I have a total value of all items equal to 1097, and my private outside offer is drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to this total value, we can assume that the expected value of this distribution is half of it (since the distribution is symmetric). Thus, my outside offer value is approximately 548.5.\n\nNow, I must consider my current utility under the current offer and compare it with my outside offer value. Since my private values are known, I can calculate the expected value of each item under the current offer:\nExpected Value Item 1 = (92 \\* 3 + 92 \\* (5 - 3)) / 2 \u2248 282\nExpected Value Item 2 = (59 \\* 4 + 59 \\* (5 - 4)) / 2 \u2248 295.5\nExpected Value Item 3 = (52 \\* 2 + 52 \\* (4 - 2)) / 2 \u2248 188\nExpected Value Item 4 = 0\nExpected Value Item 5 = (67 \\* 1 + 67 \\* (2 - 1)) / 2 \u2248 67\n\nThe total expected value of the current offer is approximately 932.5, which is less than my outside offer value (548.5). This suggests that I should consider making a counteroffer or walking away.\n\nSince the negotiation has only reached round 2, and I have not yet made a counteroffer, I can still make a counteroffer if I believe it will improve my position. Let's assume I want to keep Item 3 in order to get closer to my outside offer value. My current private value for Item 3 is 52.\n\nI can now make a counteroffer that includes only Item 5 and keeps the same quantity of Item 3 as Player 1 offers, while adjusting the quantities of other items slightly to maintain a balance between my private values. I will increase the quantity of Item 1 to offer more value for it and decrease the quantity of Item 2.\n\nHere is my counteroffer:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 3, 2, 0, 2]}\n\nThis response provides a valid counteroffer in the required format.",

                    "response": "Before making my action, I need to calculate my expected value from each item type considering the current negotiation status. Since there is no current offer on the table, I will assume an equal division of items for now.\n\nGiven:\n- Item 1: 9 units\n- Item 2: 4 units\n- Item 3: 4 units\n- Item 4: 2 units\n- Item 5: 5 units\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 87\n- Item 2: 54\n- Item 3: 10\n- Item 4: 66\n- Item 5: 42\n\nExpected value per unit for each item type considering equal division (and thus no initial offer to consider) would be the average of my private values, but since I'm making an initial offer in this round, let's calculate it:\n\n- Expected value for item 1 = (9 * 87 + 4 * 54 + 4 * 10 + 2 * 66 + 5 * 42) / (9 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 5)\n- Expected value for item 2 = \n- Expected value for item 3 = \n- Expected value for item 4 = \n- Expected value for item 5 =\n\nLet's simplify this calculation since the expected values per unit would be a weighted average of my private values. However, I need to calculate the total value first and then divide by the sum of units.\n\nTotal value of all items = 9*87 + 4*54 + 4*10 + 2*66 + 5*42 = 783 + 216 + 40 + 132 + 210 = 1381\n\nSum of units = 9 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 5 = 24\n\nExpected value per unit for each item type = Total value / Sum of units, but considering my private values for a negotiation context:\n\n- Expected value for item 1 = (9 * 87) / 24\n- Expected value for item 2 = (4 * 54) / 24\n- Expected value for item 3 = (4 * 10) / 24\n- Expected value for item 4 = (2 * 66) / 24\n- Expected value for item 5 = (5 * 42) / 24\n\nCalculating these gives:\n- Expected value for item 1 \u2248 310.625\n- Expected value for item 2 \u2248 144\n- Expected value for item 3 \u2248 44.444\n- Expected value for item 4 \u2248 138\n- Expected value for item 5 \u2248 210.833\n\nGiven these values, I would like to make an offer that takes into account my private outside offer and the overall value of all items (which is 1381). My outside offer value is 330.\n\nTo maximize my expected gain in this first round, I should aim to divide the items fairly but still give myself a decent share given my inside values. However, since we're starting from scratch without a current offer, and considering my high private value for item 1, which could significantly impact the negotiation's outcome if offered to me alone, I'll make an initial counteroffer rather than simply accepting a split.\n\nLet's calculate an initial division of items that seems fair based on expected values. Since I have different private values for each item, and considering my outside offer value is quite low (330), I should aim to give myself units that align with these high expectations in a way that still leaves room for negotiation:\n\n- Offer item 1: Considering its expected value is the highest at approximately 310.625 per unit, I might start by offering it around this value or slightly less since we're starting negotiations.\n- Offer item 2: Following its expected value and my private value being lower than item 1, but still significant for negotiation leverage.\n- Offer item 3, 4, and 5 would follow in a way that reflects their expected values, with the goal of balancing these offers so they're not too skewed towards one party.\n\nGiven these considerations and without exact numbers calculated here due to format constraints, my initial action is to make an offer based on these principles.

Since the outside offers are not relevant at this stage, let's focus on the offers on the table.\n\nFor Player 1's original offer:\n- Item 1: 7 units * 74 = 518\n- Item 2: 2 units * 94 = 188\n- Item 3: 3 units * 6 = 18\n- Item 4: 1 unit * 22 = 22\n- Item 5: 4 units * 86 = 344\n\nTotal value of the offer: 518 + 188 + 18 + 22 + 344 = 1090\n\nNow, let's calculate the value if I accept this offer (and thus Player 1 gets everything):\n- Item 1: 7 units * 74 = 518\n- Item 2: 2 units * 94 = 188\n- Item 3: 3 units * 6 = 18\n- Item 4: 1 unit * 22 = 22\n- Item 5: 4 units * 86 = 344\n\nTotal value if I accept the offer: 518 + 188 + 18 + 22 + 344 = 1090\n\nFor my counteroffer, let's consider that I would like to keep more items but still be willing to part with some of them.

Since my total value is 626 and I have a private outside offer value of 232, Player 2's total value must be significantly higher than mine (assuming they also have similar values). This implies that if we both WALK away, I will likely receive the lower of the two outside offers.\n\nHowever, we are in Round 2, and Player 2 offered a non-zero quantity for some items in Round 1. Given this information, let's calculate my expected value under each possible action:\n\nAction: ACCEPT\n\n- If I accept the current offer, I will not be able to make any further adjustments.\n- However, since there are no items with a high quantity being offered (only item 2 and item 5), it is likely that the offer does not reflect our true valuations.\n\nAction: WALK\n\n- This would mean giving up the opportunity to negotiate further. Since I have a private outside offer value of 232, if Player 2 WALKs away, I will receive this value.\n- However, since my total value of all items is high (626), it's likely that I could receive a higher value from Player 2's outside offer.\n\nAction: COUNTEROFFER\n\n- Let's analyze our current situation and the previous offers. In Round 1, both players had non-zero offers for most items.\n- Given the current offer on the table ([1, 3, 2, 5, 0]), I notice that player 2 did not accept any of my original offer (except item 2). \n- It seems reasonable to make a counteroffer with quantities close to our true valuations, as these values are drawn from a uniform random distribution. This can be inferred by analyzing the probability distributions of possible offers.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will make a counteroffer that reflects my private values and is reasonable given the previous offer from Player 2.\n\n\n\nMy action:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [15, 60, 11, 71, 18]}",

Player 2 responded with an offer of [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] that left a total value of 1534 units. The overall value for me is then 204 * (1-0.9) = 34.56 and the overall value for Player 2 is then 204 * (1-0.9) = 23.44.\n\nGiven this history, it seems like both players were willing to trade a significant amount of items in the first round, but with different quantities and distributions.\n\nIn Round 2, I see that Player 2 has accepted a more favorable offer, taking 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This leaves me with [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Player 2 now offers [1, 0, 1, 1, 1].\n\nIn this scenario, I have no items to offer in the current round. My private outside offer value is 219.\n\nMy analysis shows that if I WALK away from negotiations, I will receive my private outside offer of 219 units. However, the current offer on the table seems quite favorable for Player 2.\n\nConsidering these factors, I will attempt a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better deal.\n\nCounteroffer: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nThis counteroffer gives more items of item 2 and item 4 to me while leaving fewer items of items 3 and 5 for Player 2. The total value of my counteroffer is then 51*0 + 66*1 + 97*0 + 94*1 + 70*1 = 207 units.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the discount factor in this negotiation.

With these values in mind, my counteroffer seems reasonable and may encourage Player 2 to make a better offer.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to send a COUNTEROFFER that gives me the items of item 2 and item 4 while giving less to Player 2: {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]}",

Since there are no current offers on the table, this is an attractive option for me if we were to walk away after one round. However, since it's only round 1, and negotiation typically involves trying to get a better deal or avoiding a less desirable offer by walking away, I'll consider making an initial offer instead of immediately walking away.\n\nGiven my private values are 77 for item 1, 11 for item 2, 65 for item 3, 47 for item 4, and 24 for item 5, the quantities of items being offered to Player 2 should be based on these values. However, without a specific target value or strategy, we can consider distributing items in a way that balances my private values while also not giving away too much.\n\nA balanced approach could involve roughly dividing items according to their relative values and ensuring each item type contributes significantly to the overall offer but doesn't overly favor one over another. For simplicity, let's assume an even distribution of all items for this round as it's the first step in negotiation:\n\n- Item 1: 2 units\n- Item 2: 4.5 units (rounded from 9/2)\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 2.5 units (rounded from 5/2)\n- Item 5: 1.5 units (rounded from 3/2)\n\nThis distribution aims to balance the offer without being overly generous or stingy, considering my initial private value of 950 and the need for a starting point.\n\nSince this is an even split and no better offer can be made at this stage without knowing Player 2's preferences or values, I will proceed with making this as my first offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4.5, 3, 2.5, 1.5]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Given that Player 2's private outside offer value is unknown at this point, I want to avoid giving away too much information. However, since my total value of all items is relatively high (808), I can afford to make a generous offer.\n\nAssuming I have a uniform distribution of values between 1 and 101 for each item type, I will assume that the average private value per unit of each item type is close to the midpoint of this range. However, since Player 2's values are also unknown, I'll start by making an offer that covers most of my items but leaves some room for negotiation.\n\nLet's say I'm willing to give up a total of 200 units across all five types of items (a rough estimate based on the average private value). This gives me some flexibility while still being generous.\n\nHere's my initial offer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [100, 150, 50, 75, 125]}",
