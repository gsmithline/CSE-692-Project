Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 287. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 612 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Item 4 has very little value to me.\n\nLet me propose the following distribution:\n- I keep 1 unit of item 1, give 1 to Player 2\n- I keep all 3 units of item 2, give 0 to Player 2\n- I keep all 2 units of item 3, give 0 to Player 2\n- I keep 0 units of item 4, give all 8 to Player 2\n- No units of item 5 exist\n\nValue to me: \n1\u00d721 + 3\u00d778 + 2\u00d778 + 0\u00d72 + 0\u00d725 = 21 + 234 + 156 + 0 + 0 = 411\n\nThis would give me 411, which after the discount factor (0.9^2 = 0.81) would be 333, which is better than my outside offer of 287.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 8, 0]}",

Since the current offer (602.1) is greater than my outside offer, I shouldn't walk away.\n\nHowever, I should check if I can make a counteroffer that would give me more value while still being acceptable to Player 2. Since Player 2 rejected my first offer and counter-offered, they seem to value items 4 and 5 more than I expected. Let me try a new offer that might be more appealing to them.\n\nLet me try offering:\n[1, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n\nTotal value for me = 94 + 82 + 68 + 136 + 288 = 668\n\nWith discount for round 2: 668 \u00d7 0.9 = 601.2\n\nThis is very similar to the value of accepting their offer (602.1), but it might be more appealing to Player 2. However, since we're already in round 2, and the values are so close, it might be safer to accept their current offer rather than risk them rejecting another counteroffer and potentially walking away in round 3.\n\nGiven that the current offer is already above my outside offer value after discounting, and we're in round 2 (with round 3 being the final round), I'll accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Given Player 1's movement toward compromise, I should meet somewhere in the middle.

Let me analyze the current situation.\n\nFirst, let me calculate the value of Player 2's offer to me:\n- I get 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n- I get 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n- I get 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 84 = 168\n- I get 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n- I get 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 41 = 41\n\nTotal value to me from Player 2's offer = 180 + 192 + 168 + 0 + 41 = 581\n\nSince this is round 3, I need to apply the discount factor: 581 \u00d7 (0.9^(3-1)) = 581 \u00d7 0.81 = 470.61\n\nMy outside offer is 417, so Player 2's current offer (worth 470.61 to me) is better than my outside offer.\n\nIf I were to make another counteroffer, Player 2 would either accept, reject (WALK), or make a counteroffer. Since this is round 3, if Player 2 makes a counteroffer, it would be treated as a WALK. So the risk is high.\n\nLet me consider if I should make one more counteroffer:\n- The current offer gives me a value of 470.61\n- My outside offer is 417\n- Any counteroffer would need to provide me with a higher expected value, but there's a risk Player 2 walks\n\nGiven that Player 2 has already rejected my previous offer of [1, 1, 1, 0, 5] twice, it seems unlikely they will accept anything better for me. Their consistency suggests they have reached their limit.\n\nThe current offer is significantly better than my outside offer, and there's a risk of ending up with just my outside offer if I push for more. Therefore, the rational choice is to accept.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

The ideal outcome for me would be to keep all the high-value items:\n- I most value item 1 (99 per unit) and items 3 and 5 (59 per unit each)\n- Items 2 and 4 are worth less to me (1 and 23 respectively)\n\nLet me try offering Player 2 items 2 and 4 while keeping the rest:\n[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nThe value of what I'd keep:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 99 = 198\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 59 = 118\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 23 = 0\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 59 = 118\nTotal value to me = 434\n\nWith discount factor for round 2 (assuming acceptance in the next round):\nDiscounted value = 434 \u00d7 0.9 = 390.6\n\nHowever, Player 2 rejected my previous offer [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] and countered with [2, 0, 0, 0, 2], suggesting they strongly value items 1 and 5. I need to make a more appealing offer to avoid rejection.\n\nLet me try a different counteroffer where I keep at least one of each high-value item:\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nThe value of what I'd keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 99 = 99\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 59 = 59\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 23 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 59 = 59\nTotal value to me = 217\n\nWith discount factor:\nDiscounted value = 217 \u00d7 0.9 = 195.3\n\nThis is still better than my outside offer of 164.\n\nLooking at all options:\n1. Accept the current offer: 284.4 value\n2. Make a counteroffer of [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]: 390.6 potential value (if accepted)\n3. Make a counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]: 195.3 potential value (if accepted)\n4. Walk away: 164 value\n\nThe current offer is actually quite good for me. While making a counteroffer could potentially get me more value, it risks Player 2 walking away in the final round, which would leave me with only my outside offer of 164. Given that the current offer is already much better than my outside offer, I'll accept it.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1093. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1086 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 seems to value item 5 (they're willing to give me just 1 unit of it). Let me propose a counteroffer where I keep more of the high-value items to me (especially items 3 and 1) while giving Player 2 more of item 5 which I value less.\n\nMy counteroffer will be [1, 0, 0, 1, 3] - giving Player 2 one unit of item 1, zero units of item 2, zero units of item 3, one unit of item 4, and three units of item 5.\n\nThis means I would keep:\n- 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 40 = 200\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 87 = 348\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\nTotal value = 679\n\nAfter discount: 679 \u00d7 0.9 = 611.1\n\nThis is actually less than my outside offer value of 631. Let me rethink this.\n\nActually, Player 2's offer is quite good for me. They're offering me almost everything except 1 unit of item 5, which I value the least. This offer is worth 695.7 to me after discount, which is better than my outside offer of 631.\n\nGiven that this is already round 2 and accepting now avoids further discounting, and the current offer is actually quite favorable to me, I'll accept their offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This means I should only accept deals that give me close to maximum value.\n\nLet me calculate the value of what I want to keep:\n- I want to keep all of item 5 (3 units \u00d7 68 = 204)\n- I want to keep item 3 (1 unit \u00d7 53 = 53)\n- I want to keep most of item 2 (at least 3 units \u00d7 32 = 96)\n- I want to keep item 4 (1 unit \u00d7 27 = 27)\n- I want to keep at least 2 units of item 1 (2 units \u00d7 18 = 36)\n\nThis would give me a total of 416, which is less than my outside offer of 458.\n\nI need to be more aggressive. Let me adjust:\n- Keep all of item 5 (3 units)\n- Keep all of item 3 (1 unit)\n- Keep all of item 2 (4 units)\n- Keep all of item 4 (1 unit)\n- Keep at least 2 units of item 1 (offering 1 unit)\n\nSo my initial offer to Player 2 would be:\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 32 = 128\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 27 = 27\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 68 = 204\n\nTotal value for me: 448\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer (458). Let me be even more aggressive and only offer Player 2 nothing:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThat would be too extreme and would likely lead to them walking away. Let me reconsider.\n\nGiven my high outside offer (458), I will start with a very aggressive offer, giving Player 2 very little. I'll offer:\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis means I'm offering them 1 unit of item 1 (valued at 18 for me) and keeping everything else, giving me a value of 448.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 311. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 609 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let me make one more adjustment to keep more of item 5.\n\nFinal offer to give Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (keeping 3 for myself)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keeping 1 for myself)\n- 4 units of item 3 (keeping 1 for myself)\n- 0 units of item 4 (none available)\n- 0 units of item 5 (keeping 5 for myself)\n\nValue calculation for what I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 58 = 58\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 36 = 0\n- 5 units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 54 = 270\n\nTotal value of what I keep: 469\n\nThis is still slightly below my outside offer of 471. Since we have a discount factor of 0.9, any agreement in a later round would be worth less. Let me adjust once more to ensure I exceed my outside offer.\n\nFinal offer to Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (keeping 3 for myself)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keeping 1 for myself)",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 832. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 768 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 667. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 642 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

However, if we reach agreement in the next round, the discount would be 0.9\u00b2, which would make any deal worse.\n\nSince no reasonable division will give me more than my outside offer of 511, I'll choose to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

I need to keep enough value to exceed my outside offer of 459.\n\nFor my counteroffer, I should keep the items of highest value to me and offer Player 1 the items of lower value to me:\n- I'll keep most of item 2 (high value to me at 79)\n- I'll keep most of item 3 (high value to me at 66)\n- I'll offer more of items 1, 4, and 5 (lower values to me)\n\nMy counteroffer to Player 1:\n- Item 1: 2 units (all units)\n- Item 2: 1 unit (keeping 4 for myself)\n- Item 3: 3 units (keeping 8 for myself)\n- Item 4: 5 units (keeping 1 for myself)\n- Item 5: 2 units (keeping 1 for myself)\n\nLet me calculate the value of what I keep:\n- Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 19 = 0\n- Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 79 = 316\n- Item 3: 8 units \u00d7 66 = 528\n- Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 11 = 11\n- Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 23 = 23\nTotal value of what I keep: 878, which is well above my outside offer of 459.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 5, 2]}",

Items 1, 2, 3, and 5 are all valuable to me.\n\nLet me try offering Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 81 = 81\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 95 = 95\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 68 = 68\nTotal value I'm giving away: 367\n\nThis means I'd keep:\n- 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 81 = 405\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 95 = 380\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 68 = 204\nTotal value I'd keep: 1,268\n\nBut that's much less than my outside offer of 1,591.\n\nLet me try again with a more aggressive offer:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keeping all 6)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keeping all 4)\n- 0 units of item 3 (keeping all 5)\n- 3 units of item 4 (giving all away)\n- 0 units of item 5 (keeping all 4)\n\nThis would give me:\n- Item 1: 6 \u00d7 81 = 486\n- Item 2: 4 \u00d7 93 = 372\n- Item 3: 5 \u00d7 95 = 475\n- Item 4: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n- Item 5: 4 \u00d7 68 = 272\nTotal = 1,605\n\nThis is slightly better than my outside offer of 1,591, but I still need to make sure Player 2 receives something of value to them.\n\nSince I need to maximize my value and my outside offer is so high, I'll make an initial aggressive offer giving Player 2 only what I value least:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Item 5: 43 per unit\n\nFor my first offer, I'll try to keep most of the high-value items while offering some lower-value items to Player 2:\n\nProposed offer to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 3 units (keeping 4 for myself = 256 value)\n- Item 2: 2 units (keeping 6 for myself = 564 value)\n- Item 3: 0 units (keeping 1 for myself = 81 value)\n- Item 4: 5 units (keeping 7 for myself = 476 value)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (keeping 1 for myself = 43 value)\n\nValue of what I keep: 256 + 564 + 81 + 476 + 43 = 1,420\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 1,552, so I need to adjust my offer to keep more value.\n\nLet me revise:\n- Item 1: 2 units (keeping 5 for myself = 320 value)\n- Item 2: 1 unit (keeping 7 for myself = 658 value)\n- Item 3: 0 units (keeping 1 for myself = 81 value)\n- Item 4: 4 units (keeping 8 for myself = 544 value)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (keeping 1 for myself = 43 value)\n\nValue of what I keep: 320 + 658 + 81 + 544 + 43 = 1,646\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer of 1,552, so it's acceptable to me.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Accept current offer: Value = 109.35\n2. Walk away: Value = 469\n3. Make a counteroffer\n\nSince we're in round 3 (the final round), if I make a counteroffer, Player 2 will either accept or walk away. \n\nLet me calculate what I'd need to keep to beat my outside offer after discounting:\n469 / 0.81 = 579 value needed before discount\n\nMy highest value item is item 3 at 91 per unit. I'll keep all 6 units of it (546 value) and supplement with other items.\n\nIf I keep:\n- 0 units of item 1 (offer all 6 to Player 2)\n- 0 units of item 2 (offer all 2 to Player 2)\n- 6 units of item 3 (offer 0 to Player 2)\n- 2 units of item 4 (offer 3 to Player 2)\n- 0 units of item 5 (offer all 5 to Player 2)\n\nMy value would be: 0 + 0 + (6\u00d791) + (2\u00d719) + 0 = 546 + 38 = 584\n\nAfter discount: 584 \u00d7 0.81 = 472.04, which exceeds my outside offer of 469.\n\nHowever, Player 2 may reject this offer and walk away if it doesn't meet their needs. Since this is the final round and the current offer value (109.35) is much lower than my outside offer (469), walking away is my best option.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since this is the last round, I need to be careful not to be too aggressive. Player 2 will likely walk away if my offer doesn't give them enough value.\n\nLet's try one more counteroffer where I keep most of the high-value items to me (items 3, 4, and 5):\n\nMy potential counteroffer to Player 2:\n- 5 units of item 1 (keeping 2 for myself): 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n- 3 units of item 2 (keeping 2 for myself): 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n- 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 3 for myself): 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n- 0 units of item 4 (keeping 2 for myself): 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n- 4 units of item 5 (keeping 5 for myself): 5 \u00d7 61 = 305\n\nTotal value to me: 42 + 22 + 174 + 196 + 305 = 739\nWith discount: 739 \u00d7 0.81 = 598.59\n\nHowever, this is risky because Player 2 might reject it in the final round, and we'd both get our outside offers.\n\nComparing my options:\n1. Accept current offer: 396.9 (better than outside offer of 323)\n2. Make counteroffer: potentially 598.59, but risk ending with outside offer of 323\n3. Walk away: 323\n\nSince this is the final round and Player 2's response to a counteroffer would be their final decision, I should be cautious. The current offer is already better than my outside offer, and there's risk in making another counteroffer.\n\nI'll accept the current offer to secure a value better than my outside option.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.
