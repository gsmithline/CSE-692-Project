If we reach an agreement in round 2, it will be worth 90% of the original value.\n\nStep 5: Formulate a counteroffer.\nSince my highest-value items are item 1 (98), item 3 (66), and item 2 (54), I should try to keep most of these. Item 4 (8) has very little value to me, so I can offer most of them.\n\nMy counteroffer will be:\n[1, 1, 0, 3, 3] - giving Player 1 one unit of item 1, one unit of item 2, zero units of item 3, three units of item 4, and three units of item 5.\n\nThis would leave me with:\n[3, 2, 1, 1, 2]\nValue to me = (3\u00d798) + (2\u00d754) + (1\u00d766) + (1\u00d78) + (2\u00d746) = 294 + 108 + 66 + 8 + 92 = 568\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 735, but it's a starting point for negotiation.

I need to make the offer somewhat balanced so Player 2 considers it\n\nFor my initial offer, I'll offer:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keeping all for myself)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (giving all to Player 2)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 2 for myself)\n- 5 units of item 4 (keeping 1 for myself)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 5 for myself)\n\nThis means I'm keeping items worth: 65 + 0 + (2\u00d771) + (1\u00d75) + (5\u00d798) = 65 + 0 + 142 + 5 + 490 = 702 points\nI'm offering items worth (to me): 0 + 10 + (1\u00d771) + (5\u00d75) + (1\u00d798) = 0 + 10 + 71 + 25 + 98 = 204 points\n\nThis offer gives me 702 points, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 580 points, while giving Player 2 a substantial portion of the items.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 5, 1]}",

This means I should be willing to walk away unless I get a deal worth at least 443.\n\nGiven the high outside offer, I should try to keep most of the high-value items for myself (items 1 and 2) while offering Player 2 the items that are worth less to me.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n1. I should keep most or all of item 2 (my highest value item at 51 per unit)\n2. I should keep most of item 1 (my second highest value at 31 per unit)\n3. I can offer all of item 3 (only worth 1 per unit to me)\n4. I might need to offer some of items 4 and 5\n\nFor my initial offer, I'll propose giving Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (keeping 5 for myself)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keeping all 4 for myself)\n- 6 units of item 3 (giving away all units)\n- 0 units of item 4 (keeping both for myself)\n- 2 units of item 5 (keeping 2 for myself)\n\nThe value I'm giving up: 31 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 20 = 57\nThe value I'm keeping: 155 + 204 + 0 + 46 + 20 = 425\n\nSince my outside offer is 443, this initial offer actually leaves me with less value than my outside offer. I should adjust it to keep more value while still making a reasonable first offer.\n\nBetter offer - I'll give Player 2:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keeping all 6 for myself)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keeping all 4 for myself)\n- 6 units of item 3 (giving away all units)\n- 0 units of item 4 (keeping both for myself)\n- 2 units of item 5 (keeping 2 for myself)\n\nThe value I'm giving up: 0 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 20 = 26\nThe value I'm keeping: 186 + 204 + 0 + 46 + 20 = 456\n\nThis is better than my outside offer of 443, so I'll propose this offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 6, 0, 2]}",

                    "response": "I need to evaluate the current offer and decide whether to accept, walk away, or make a counteroffer.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the value of the current offer to me.\nThe offer to me is [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 25 = 25\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 13 = 26\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 32 = 0\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\nTotal value of this offer to me: 25 + 2 + 26 + 0 + 102 = 155\n\nStep 2: Compare with my outside offer.\nMy outside offer is 306, which is much higher than the value of the current offer (155).\n\nStep 3: Consider making a counteroffer that would be better for me.\nThe total items are: [3, 1, 4, 1, 3]\nMy values are: [25, 2, 13, 32, 51]\n\nItem 5 has the highest value (51), so I want most of those.\nItem 4 has the second highest value (32), so I want that.\nItem 1 has the third highest value (25).\nItem 3 has lower value (13).\nItem 2 has very low value (2).\n\nI should keep most of the high-value items and offer Player 1 the lower-value items. A good counteroffer would be to give Player 1:\n[1, 1, 3, 0, 0]\nThis means I keep [2, 0, 1, 1, 3], which gives me:\n(2\u00d725) + (0\u00d72) + (1\u00d713) + (1\u00d732) + (3\u00d751) = 50 + 0 + 13 + 32 + 153 = 248\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer (306), but we're only in round 1, and the value will decrease in later rounds due to the discount factor. Let me try a more aggressive offer:\n[0, 1, 3, 0, 0]\nThis means I keep [3, 0, 1, 1, 3], which gives me:\n(3\u00d725) + (0\u00d72) + (1\u00d713) + (1\u00d732) + (3\u00d751) = 75 + 0 + 13 + 32 + 153 = 273\n\nThis is better but still below my outside offer. Since we're in round 1 and the discount factor will reduce values in later rounds, I think the best strategy is to WALK.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

However, I need to make an offer that might be appealing to them, since their valuations are unknown to me.\n\nFor my initial offer, I'll propose:\n- Item 1: Give 2 units (keep 4) = 320 value for me\n- Item 2: Give 2 units (keep 4) = 288 value for me\n- Item 3: Give 2 units (keep 2) = 112 value for me\n- Item 4: Give 1 unit (keep 5) = 405 value for me\n- Item 5: Give 4 units (keep 2) = 88 value for me\n\nValue I keep: 320 + 288 + 112 + 405 + 88 = 1213\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 1353, but this is just my opening offer and we're in round 1, so there's room to negotiate. Also, with the discount factor, my outside offer in later rounds would be worth less (1353 \u00d7 0.9 = 1217.7 in round 2, and 1353 \u00d7 0.81 = 1095.93 in round 3).\n\nI'll make this initial offer to gauge Player 2's reaction, and then I can adjust in subsequent rounds based on their response.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 1, 4]}",

They seem willing to give up item 1 completely, which is good for me.\n\nLet me propose a new offer that keeps more of the high-value items for me:\n- I'll keep all of item 5 except 1 unit (5 for me, 1 for them)\n- I'll keep both units of item 1 (2 for me, 0 for them)\n- I'll keep item 3 (1 for me, 0 for them)\n- I'll give them all of item 4 (0 for me, 2 for them)\n- I'll give them most of item 2 (1 for me, 4 for them)\n\nSo my counteroffer to Player 2 would be [0, 4, 0, 2, 1]\n\nLet me check the value of this allocation for me:\n- I get: [2, 1, 1, 0, 5]\n- Value: (2 \u00d7 44) + (1 \u00d7 15) + (1 \u00d7 42) + (0 \u00d7 6) + (5 \u00d7 81) = 88 + 15 + 42 + 0 + 405 = 550\n- With discount for next round (if accepted): 550 \u00d7 0.9\u00b2 = 445.5\n\nThis is significantly better than both the current offer (276.3) and my outside option (237).\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 2, 1]}",

Since we're already in round 2, any deal in the next round would be discounted by 0.9\u00b2. I should make a reasonable counter that maximizes my value but is also likely to be accepted.\n\nBased on the negotiation history, Player 1 seems interested in items 1, 2, and 3. I'm most interested in item 3 (value 96) and item 4 (value 93).\n\nLet me propose a counteroffer:\n- Give 1 unit of item 1 to Player 1 (keeping 1)\n- Give 4 units of item 2 to Player 1 (keeping 2)\n- Give 0 units of item 3 to Player 1 (keeping all 6)\n- Give 1 unit of item 4 to Player 1 (keeping 1)\n- Give 2 units of item 5 to Player 1 (keeping 1)\n\nFor me, this would be worth:\n(1\u00d740) + (2\u00d716) + (6\u00d796) + (1\u00d793) + (1\u00d731) = 40 + 32 + 576 + 93 + 31 = 772\n\nBut given the discount for round 3 (0.9\u00b2), this would be worth 772 \u00d7 0.81 = 625.32\n\nThe current offer is worth 592.2 to me, and my counteroffer's expected value is 625.32. The difference is relatively small, and there's a risk Player 1 might walk away.\n\nGiven this analysis, I believe accepting the current offer is the rational choice, as it provides good value now rather than risking a worse outcome.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

                    "response": "I need to determine a strategic opening offer that maximizes my expected value while being reasonable enough that Player 2 might accept.\n\nFirst, let me analyze the items and their values to me:\n- Item 1: 5 units \u00d7 39 value = 195 total\n- Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 92 value = 92 total\n- Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 4 value = 0 total\n- Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 73 value = 219 total\n- Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 83 value = 83 total\n\nMy total possible value from all items is 589, and my outside offer is 514.\n\nSince my outside offer is quite high (514/589 = ~87% of the maximum possible value), I should be willing to walk away if I can't get a deal that gives me significantly more than 514.\n\nFor my opening offer, I should keep most of the high-value items for myself. I'll offer Player 2 some of the items I value less:\n\n- For item 1, I value each unit at 39 (relatively low). I'll offer 3 units to Player 2, keeping 2 for myself.\n- For item 2, I value it highly at 92, so I'll keep it.\n- For item 3, there are 0 units, so nothing to offer.\n- For item 4, I value each unit at 73 (high). I'll offer 1 unit to Player 2, keeping 2 for myself.\n- For item 5, I value it highly at 83, so I'll keep it.\n\nThis means my offer to Player 2 is [3, 0, 0, 1, 0], which would leave me with 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nThe value to me of this division would be:\n(2 \u00d7 39) + (1 \u00d7 92) + (0 \u00d7 4) + (2 \u00d7 73) + (1 \u00d7 83) = 78 + 92 + 0 + 146 + 83 = 399\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 514, but this is just my opening position. In following rounds, I can adjust based on their counteroffers.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider. Since my starting offer would give me less than my outside offer, I should be more aggressive. Let me try:\n\n- Item 1: Offer 2 units to Player 2, keeping 3 for myself\n- Item 2: Keep it all (0 to Player 2)\n- Item 3: None to offer\n- Item 4: Offer 0 units, keeping all 3\n- Item 5: Keep it all (0 to Player 2)\n\nThis offer [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] would give me:\n(3 \u00d7 39) + (1 \u00d7 92) + (0 \u00d7 4) + (3 \u00d7 73) + (1 \u00d7 83) = 117 + 92 + 0 + 219 + 83 = 511\n\nThis is still slightly below my outside offer. My outside offer is very strong, so I need to keep most items.\n\nLet me try one more option:\n- Item 1: Offer 1 unit to Player 2, keeping 4 for myself\n- Item 2-5: Keep everything\n\nThis offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] would give me:\n(4 \u00d7 39) + (1 \u00d7 92) + (0 \u00d7 4) + (3 \u00d7 73) + (1 \u00d7 83) = 156 + 92 + 0 + 219 + 83 = 550\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer of 514, so it's a viable position to start with.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}",

I should aim to keep high-value items for myself while giving away items I value less.\n\nMy highest value items are item 2 (70) and item 1 (44), followed by item 4 (43) and item 5 (35). My lowest value item is item 3 (4).\n\nCurrent division if I accept:\n- I get: [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n- Player 2 gets: [0, 0, 0, 3, 1]\n\nI can try to improve on this with a counteroffer. I'll keep item 2 entirely (high value to me) and most of item 1, while giving up more of item 3 (low value to me) and some of items 4 and 5.\n\nPotential counteroffer (what I give to Player 2):\n[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n\nThis would leave me with [2, 1, 0, 2, 2], which values at:\n2\u00d744 + 1\u00d770 + 0\u00d74 + 2\u00d743 + 2\u00d735 = 88 + 70 + 0 + 86 + 70 = 314\n\nWith the discount factor, this would be worth 314 \u00d7 0.9 = 282.6, which is better than accepting the current offer.\n\nHowever, this is the final round, so if Player 2 rejects my counteroffer, we'll both walk away with our outside offers. Given that my outside offer (98) is much lower than the value of the current offer (247.5), I should be careful about making a counteroffer that might be rejected.\n\nThe current offer is already quite favorable to me, giving me 275 value out of the total possible 439. While I could try to get more, there's a risk.\n\nSince we're in the second round and there's one more round left, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me but still reasonable for Player 2.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 2, 1]}",

This seems like a reasonable offer.\n\nLet me consider a counteroffer that might improve my position while still being attractive to Player 2:\n- I really value item 1 (99), so I'll only give up 0 units\n- I'll offer 3 units of item 2 (keeping 4 for myself)\n- I'll offer all 2 units of item 3 (I don't value it much)\n- I'll offer 3 units of item 4 (keeping 4 for myself)\n- I'll offer 3 units of item 5 (keeping 2 for myself)\n\nThis counteroffer [0, 3, 2, 3, 3] would give me:\n- Item 1: 8 units = 8 \u00d7 99 = 792\n- Item 2: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 67 = 268\n- Item 3: 0 units = 0 \u00d7 17 = 0\n- Item 4: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 31 = 124\n- Item 5: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 44 = 88\nTotal: 1272 \u00d7 0.9 = 1144.8 (with discount)\n\nThis is better than accepting their offer. Since we're in round 2 with one more round to go, it makes sense to make this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 2, 3, 3]}",

The full allocation includes:\n- 12 units of item 1 (worth 91 each)\n- 4 units of item 2 (worth 72 each)\n- 2 units of item 3 (worth 59 each)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (worth 90 each)\n- 4 units of item 5 (worth 50 each)\n\nI should keep most of the high-value items (1 and 4) for myself. Let me try a counteroffer where I offer:\n[3, 2, 1, 0, 2]\n\nThis means I would keep:\n- 9 units of item 1 (worth 91 each) = 819\n- 2 units of item 2 (worth 72 each) = 144\n- 1 unit of item 3 (worth 59 each) = 59\n- 1 unit of item 4 (worth 90 each) = 90\n- 2 units of item 5 (worth 50 each) = 100\n\nTotal value to me: 819 + 144 + 59 + 90 + 100 = 1212\n\nWith the discount factor for round 2, this would be worth 1212 * 0.9 = 1090.8, which is still less than my outside offer of 1216.\n\nHowever, we're now in round 2, and if we proceed to round 3, the discount factor will reduce my payoff further. Given that my outside offer (1216) is better than what I can reasonably expect from this negotiation, I should walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If I make a counteroffer, Player 2 will either accept it or walk away since this is the final round.\n\nI need to offer Player 2 something attractive enough that they'll accept, while maximizing my own value.\n\nFrom Player 2's behavior, they seem to value item 5 highly (they've consistently asked for all 5 units). They've also been consistent about wanting 4 units of item 1, but don't seem to care as much about item 3 (asking for 0 units).\n\nLet me try a final counteroffer:\n- Give 4 units of item 1 (keeping 3): 3 \u00d7 70 = 210\n- Give 1 unit of item 2 (keeping 1): 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n- Give 0 units of item 3 (keeping 2): 2 \u00d7 73 = 146\n- Give 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 5): 5 \u00d7 94 = 470\n- Give 4 units of item 5 (keeping 1): 1 \u00d7 72 = 72\n\nMy value from this counteroffer: 210 + 12 + 146 + 470 + 72 = 910\nWith discount: 910 \u00d7 0.81 = 737.1\n\nHowever, there's a risk Player 2 might reject and walk away if I change the terms now. The difference between my counteroffer (737.1) and accepting their offer (678.78) is about 58.32 points, which is relatively small compared to the risk of getting only my outside offer (576).\n\nSince we're in the final round and Player 2 has been consistent in their demands, I'll accept their offer. The current offer (678.78) is significantly better than my outside option (576).\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

                    "response": "I need to evaluate the current offer and determine my best action.\n\nFirst, let me calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 87 = 348\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 18 = 0\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 88 = 352\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 84 = 84\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 1 = 4\n\nTotal value of current offer = 348 + 0 + 352 + 84 + 4 = 788\n\nSince we're in round 2, the discount factor is 0.9\u00b9 = 0.9\nSo my discounted value is 788 \u00d7 0.9 = 709.2\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 50.\n\nLet me think about potential counteroffers. My highest value items are item 1 (87), item 3 (88), and item 4 (84). Item 2 (18) is of moderate value, and item 5 (1) is nearly worthless to me.\n\nA strategic counteroffer would be one where I give up more of item 5 (which I don't value much) in exchange for keeping more of items 1, 3, and 4.\n\nLet me propose this counteroffer:\n- I give Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 5]\n- I keep: [4, 1, 4, 2, 1]\n\nThe value to me would be:\n4\u00d787 + 1\u00d718 + 4\u00d788 + 2\u00d784 + 1\u00d71 = 348 + 18 + 352 + 168 + 1 = 887\n\nWith discount: 887 \u00d7 0.9 = 798.3\n\nThis is even better than the current offer. However, I'm concerned about making the same offer as before, as Player 1 already rejected it. Let me adjust slightly:\n\n- I give Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 6]\n- I keep: [4, 1, 4, 2, 0]\n\nWait, there are only 6 units of item 5 total, so this works. This gives me:\n4\u00d787 + 1\u00d718 + 4\u00d788 + 2\u00d784 + 0\u00d71 = 348 + 18 + 352 + 168 + 0 = 886\n\nWith discount: 886 \u00d7 0.9 = 797.4\n\nThis is still better than accepting the current offer. Given that we're in round 2 of 3, I should make a final counteroffer to maximize my value.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 6]}",

I should prioritize keeping high-value items (items 1, 3, and 5) and offering low-value items (items 2 and 4).\n\nIf I keep all of items 1, 3, and 5:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 99 = 297\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n- 6 units of item 5: 6 \u00d7 69 = 414\nTotal: 793\n\nAnd offer all of items 2 and 4:\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 7 units of item 4\n\nWith round 2 discount (0.9), this would be worth 793 \u00d7 0.9 = 713.7, which is still less than my outside offer.\n\nHowever, there's a chance Player 2 will accept this offer in the final round, giving me 713.7 \u00d7 0.9 = 642.3, which is still less than my outside offer.\n\nSince both the current offer and any reasonable counteroffer appear to be worth less than my outside offer, walking away is the rational choice.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Let me see if I can improve the deal by offering a counteroffer where I keep all of item 5 but give up more of another item.\n\nLet me construct a counteroffer:\n- I'll give Player 2: 0 units of item 1 (keeping all 2)\n- I'll give Player 2: 3 units of item 2 (keeping 1)\n- I'll give Player 2: 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 3)\n- I'll give Player 2: 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 1)\n- I'll give Player 2: 0 units of item 5 (keeping all 3)\n\nThis is essentially the same as their offer except I'm keeping all of item 5 and giving them 1 unit of item 4.\n\nLet me calculate my value with this counteroffer:\nValue for me: (2\u00d786) + (1\u00d735) + (3\u00d781) + (1\u00d788) + (3\u00d797) = 172 + 35 + 243 + 88 + 291 = 829\n\nWith the discount factor: 829 \u00d7 0.9 = 746.1\n\nWait, I've made a mistake in my calculation.

Let me consider if there's a better counteroffer.\n\nGiven that Player 2 is willing to give me all of items 1 and 5, plus most of item 3, this seems like a good deal for me. The only items with potentially better trades would be getting both units of item 4, but making a counteroffer would lead to additional discounting.\n\nI believe accepting this offer is the best action since it gives me a good value and avoids further discounting.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This means I only need to secure a deal worth slightly more than 787 to be better off than taking my outside option.\n\nStep 3: Rank items by value per unit to prioritize what to keep:\n1. Item 1: 66 per unit (highest)\n2. Item 3: 43 per unit\n3. Item 4: 38 per unit\n4. Item 2: 36 per unit\n5. Item 5: 34 per unit (lowest)\n\nStep 4: Formulate an initial offer.\nSince my outside offer is so high (787 out of 794 possible), I need to keep most high-value items. However, I should also make an offer that Player 2 might accept.\n\nI'll keep all of item 1 (my highest value), most of item 3, and some of items 2, 4, and 5. I'll offer Player 2:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keeping all for myself)\n- 3 units of item 2 (giving half)\n- 2 units of item 3 (keeping most for myself)\n- 2 units of item 4 (splitting evenly)\n- 2 units of item 5 (giving most to Player 2)\n\nLet me verify the value I'd keep:\n- Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 66 = 66\n- Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 36 = 108\n- Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 43 = 172\n- Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 38 = 76\n- Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 34 = 34\nTotal value kept: 456\n\nThis is significantly below my outside offer of 787, which doesn't make sense. Let me recalculate a better offer.\n\nI should keep most items to exceed my outside offer value of 787:\n- Keep all of item 1 (1 unit)\n- Keep most of item 2 (5 units)\n- Keep most of item 3 (5 units) \n- Keep most of item 4 (3 units)\n- Keep most of item 5 (2 units)\n\nThis gives me:\n- Item 1: 1 \u00d7 66 = 66\n- Item 2: 5 \u00d7 36 = 180\n- Item 3: 5 \u00d7 43 = 215\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 38 = 114\n- Item 5: 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\nTotal: 643\n\nThis is still below my outside offer. Since my outside offer is so high, I need to keep even more.\n\nFinal offer to Player 2:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis means I keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 66\n- 5 units of item 2 = 180\n- 5 units of item 3 = 215\n- 3 units of item 4 = 114\n- 2 units of item 5 = 68\nTotal: 643\n\nWhile this is still below my outside offer (787), it's round 1 and I'll receive counter-offers that may improve.

The current offer (378) is better than my outside offer.\n\nStep 3: Consider if I should make a counteroffer.\nI have these items to divide:\n- 4 units of item 1 (valued at 68 each)\n- 5 units of item 2 (valued at 40 each)\n- 3 units of item 3 (valued at 37 each)\n- 5 units of item 4 (valued at 62 each)\n- 3 units of item 5 (valued at 45 each)\n\nIf I keep everything, the total value would be 1028. But I need to offer something to Player 1.\n\nSince I value item 1 (68) and item 4 (62) the most, I should try to keep more of those. I value item 3 (37) the least, so I can offer more of those.\n\nLet me construct a counteroffer where I give Player 1:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 68 = 204\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 40 = 80\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 37 = 37\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 * 62 = 248\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 45 = 45\nTotal value for me = 614, which is better than both the current offer and my outside option.\n\nStep 4: Consider the discount factor.\nIf I make a counteroffer now, we'll move to round 2, and the discount factor (0.9) will apply.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1196. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
