Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 570. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 570. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 3, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 1 + 45 x 5 + 37 x 3 + 40 x 0 + 60 x 3\n    which is 569 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 570. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I first need to analyze the current situation and evaluate potential offers based on my values and outside offer.\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 570.\n   - My values for each item:\n     - Item 1: 53\n     - Item 2: 45\n     - Item 3: 37\n     - Item 4: 40\n     - Item 5: 60\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 6 units of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   \n   - Discount factor: Since this is round 1, the discount factor (gamma) hasn't yet reduced the value. It becomes relevant in subsequent rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - No current offer to evaluate from Player 2.\n   - I'll explore potential counteroffers:\n     - If I keep more value than my outside offer, it's beneficial to continue negotiation. For example:\n\n       - Proposal 1 (Offer: [0, 3, 3, 0, 5]):\n         - My portion: [2, 3, 2, 1, 0] = 2\u00d753 + 3\u00d745 + 2\u00d737 + 1\u00d740 + 0\u00d760 = 106 + 135 + 74 + 40 + 0 = 355\n\n       - This offer leaves me with a total value of 355, which is less than my outside offer of 570, not acceptable.\n\n     - Proposal 2 (Offer: [0, 0, 2, 0, 5]):\n       - My portion: [2, 6, 3, 1, 0] = 2\u00d753 + 6\u00d745 + 3\u00d737 + 1\u00d740 + 0\u00d760 = 106 + 270 + 111 + 40 + 0 = 527\n\n       - This offer is still below my outside offer value of 570.\n\n     - Proposal 3 (Offer: [0, 4, 1, 0, 3]):\n       - My portion: [2, 2, 4, 1, 2] = 2\u00d753 + 2\u00d745 + 4\u00d737 + 1\u00d740 + 2\u00d760 = 106 + 90 + 148 + 40 + 120 = 504\n\n       - This proposal is also below my outside offer value.\n\n     - Proposal 4 (Offer: [0, 1, 3, 0, 0]):\n       - My portion: [2, 5, 2, 1, 5] = 2\u00d753 + 5\u00d745 + 2\u00d737 + 1\u00d740 + 5\u00d760 = 106 + 225 + 74 + 40 + 300 = 745\n\n       - This proposal results in a value higher than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n\n   The Proposal 4 is favorable as it results in a value of 745, which is higher than my outside offer value of 570. It also ensures I am not making any of the negotiation mistakes outlined. Therefore, I will make a counteroffer based on Proposal 4.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

For example, I can propose to keep combinations that clearly surpass my outside option of 256. These combinations could involve retaining high-value items.\n\nFor instance, keeping all items could maximize my value:\n\n- My value if I keep all items:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 95 = 95\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n  - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 81 = 324\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n  - Total = 898\n  \nProposing an offer means offering some combination that leaves a final value greater than 256. A balanced initial offer could involve giving Player 2 some lower value items and one higher value item.\n\nTo maximize my value while making a plausible offer, I can:\n- Offer Player 2: 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 1 of item 5 \n\nMy value for keeping this share:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 95\n- 2 units of item 2 = 196\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 47\n- 2 units of item 4 = 162\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 71\n- Total value = 571\n\nThis gives me a value significantly higher than my outside offer of 256 and seems like a strong initial move to propose.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 4, 7, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 2 + 35 x 1 + 54 x 4 + 63 x 7 + 42 x 5\n    which is 978 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 980. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

However, I need to offer items to Player 2 and keep enough value above 980.\n\nI will attempt to make a counteroffer that balances the division to maximize my value while ensuring the total is above 980.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep [1, 2, 2, 5, 2] items:\n\n- My retained items' value:\n  - 1 * 38 + 2 * 35 + 2 * 54 + 5 * 63 + 2 * 42 = 38 + 70 + 108 + 315 + 84 = 615\n\nMy retained value is significantly below my outside option of 980. This indicates I need to adjust and keep more valuable items.\n\nPerhaps I can try another combination and readjust:\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I keep [2, 3, 4, 5, 5] items:\n\n- My retained items' value:\n  - 2 * 38 + 3 * 35 + 4 * 54 + 5 * 63 + 5 * 42 = 76 + 105 + 216 + 315 + 210 = 922\n\nMy retained value is less than 980, indicating this offer is not acceptable either.\n\nI need to focus on retaining items with higher per unit value until my total value exceeds my outside offer.\n\nLet's optimize further:\n\nI will propose a counteroffer where I keep [2, 3, 3, 6, 5] items:\n\n- My retained items' value:\n  - 2 * 38 + 3 * 35 + 3 * 54 + 6 * 63 + 5 * 42 = 76 + 105 + 162 + 378 + 210 = 931\n\nThis is below 980. Refining further:\n\nI will propose a counteroffer where I keep [2, 4, 5, 8, 4] items:\n\n- My retained item\u2019s value:\n  - 2 * 38 + 4 * 35 + 5 * 54 + 8 * 63 + 4 * 42 = 76 + 140 + 270 + 504 + 168 = 1158\n\nThis value is above my outside offer of 980, indicating it is a valid counteroffer.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Since no current offer exists, I will make a counteroffer.\n   - I will propose that Player 2 receives [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], meaning I keep [2, 4, 5, 8, 4].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 69 x 0 + 71 x 0 + 1 x 5 + 40 x 0\n    which is 5 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 12. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 1 + 16 x 1 + 42 x 1 + 69 x 1 + 77 x 0\n    which is 227 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 229. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 2 + 31 x 0 + 24 x 0 + 28 x 0 + 40 x 0\n    which is 8 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 10. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, since this is the first round, there is an opportunity to negotiate a better deal.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer that ensures my value is at least equal to or greater than my outside offer is a priority.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I make sure I get a better outcome than my outside offer. \n\nA potential counteroffer could be giving Player 1 two units of Item 1 and three units of Item 2, keeping all of items 3, 4, and 5 for myself.

After calculation, this gives me a self-retained total value of 406 (greater than 203), providing a clear advantage over my outside offer.\n\nThe counteroffer decision:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

I must reevaluate.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the challenge in formulating a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer, it's in my best interest to walk away.\n\n### Decision\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 0 + 61 x 0 + 98 x 2 + 92 x 2 + 48 x 0\n    which is 380 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 381. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 0 + 4 x 2 + 23 x 4 + 44 x 2 + 10 x 4\n    which is 228 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 229. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine my action, let's go through the steps.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 229.\n   - My values per item unit are:\n     - Item 1: 14\n     - Item 2: 4\n     - Item 3: 23\n     - Item 4: 44\n     - Item 5: 10\n   - Total units of each item available:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   \n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. However, since it's round 1, it doesn't immediately influence my decision apart from considering the possibility of delay.\n\n2) **Assess potential offers:**\n\n   I need to propose a starting offer. Here's how I can maximize my value:\n\n   - My goal is to ensure my share exceeds the outside offer value of 229.\n\n   Let's try keeping more of the items I've valued highly, specifically item 3 and item 4, as they have the highest value per unit to me.\n\n   - **Keep 3 of item 3** (Value: 3 x 23 = 69)\n   - **Keep 2 of item 4** (Value: 2 x 44 = 88)\n   - **Keep 3 of item 5** (Value: 3 x 10 = 30)\n   - **Give away 4 of item 1** (Value: 4 x 14 = 56)\n   - **Give away 3 of item 2** (Value: 3 x 4 = 12)\n   - **Give away 3 of item 3** (Value to me: 3 x 23 = 69)\n   - **Give away 3 of item 5** (Value to me: 3 x 10 = 30)\n\n   Calculation for items kept for myself:\n   - Total value to me: 69 + 88 + 30 = 187\n\n   The total value to me is 187, which is below my outside offer of 229. Hence, I need to adjust the allocation to receive higher value.\n\n   Adjusting to improve my position:\n   - **Keep 4 of item 1** (Value: 4 x 14 = 56)\n   - **Keep 3 of item 2** (Value: 3 x 4 = 12)\n   - **Keep 6 of item 3** (Value: 6 x 23 = 138)\n   - **Keep 2 of item 4** (Value: 2 x 44 = 88)\n   - **Keep 3 of item 5** (Value: 3 x 10 = 30)\n\n   Let's offer:\n   - Give 0 of item 1\n   - Give 0 of item 2\n   - Give 0 of item 3\n   - Give 0 of item 4\n   - Give 3 of item 5\n\n   Recalculate the value to myself:\n   - Total value to me: 56 + 12 + 138 + 88 + 30 = 324\n\n   This approach positions me well above my outside offer by keeping a substantial amount of high-valued items.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   Given this proposal allows me to outperform my outside offer by a substantial margin, though it seems impracticable for negotiation, it helps frame an upper boundary.\n\n   I should instead propose a more modest offer, not all, but giving away part of items 1, 2, and 5. For the first counteroffer:\n\n   - Offer 4 of item 1\n   - Offer 3 of item 2\n   - Offer 0 of item 3\n   - Offer 1 of item 4\n   - Offer 3 of item 5\n\n   This less aggressive but still strategic offer provides a reasonable negotiation basis while aligning with my interests.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 3, 0, 1, 3]}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 92 for item 1, 75 for item 2, 65 for item 3, 46 for item 4, 51 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1381. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 275. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 275. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 987 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 0 + 75 x 1 + 65 x 0 + 46 x 1 + 51 x 3\n    which is 274 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 275. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 3, 0, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 3, 2, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?
