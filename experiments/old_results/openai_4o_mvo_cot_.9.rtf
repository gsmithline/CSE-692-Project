Game 1, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 5 for item 1, 64 for item 2, 87 for item 3, 52 for item 4, 22 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 892. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 383. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 383. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 690 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 383.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 50 for item 1, 92 for item 2, 99 for item 3, 45 for item 4, 72 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1260. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 991. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 991. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1074 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 991.\

Game 2, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 99 for item 1, 17 for item 2, 33 for item 3, 66 for item 4, 31 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1241. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 72. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 72. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 738 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 72.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 10 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 49 for item 1, 70 for item 2, 97 for item 3, 8 for item 4, 71 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1194. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 782. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 782. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 885 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 782.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\

================================================================================\
Game 3, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 10 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 49 for item 1, 70 for item 2, 97 for item 3, 8 for item 4, 71 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1194. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 782. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 782. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 885 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 782.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 49 for item 1, 70 for item 2, 97 for item 3, 8 for item 4, 71 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1194. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 782. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 782. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 885 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 782.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\

Game 4, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 15 for item 1, 46 for item 2, 59 for item 3, 32 for item 4, 60 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 819. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 756. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 756. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 636 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 756.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 3 for item 1, 73 for item 2, 35 for item 3, 17 for item 4, 40 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 591. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 412. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 412. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 504 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 412.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

Game 6, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 5 for item 1, 79 for item 2, 55 for item 3, 41 for item 4, 59 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 819. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 616. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 616. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 717 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 616.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 5 for item 1, 79 for item 2, 55 for item 3, 41 for item 4, 59 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 819. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 616. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 616. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 717 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 616.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\

Game 6, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 38 for item 1, 38 for item 2, 2 for item 3, 37 for item 4, 29 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 455. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 25. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 25. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 432 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 25.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 3, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 25 for item 1, 80 for item 2, 42 for item 3, 1 for item 4, 60 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 650. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 552. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 552. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 624 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 552.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 825 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 962.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

Let's consider some possible divisions:\\n\\n   **Example Counteroffer:**\\n   - Possible offer to Player 2: [3, 0, 4, 1, 2] (this means I keep [3, 1, 4, 1, 1])\\n   - Calculate my total value if I choose this partition:\\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \\u00d7 87 = 261\\n     - 1 units of item 2 = 1 \\u00d7 73 = 73\\n     - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \\u00d7 82 = 328\\n     - 1 units of item 4 = 1 \\u00d7 28 = 28\\n     - 1 units of item 5 = 1 \\u00d7 5 = 5\\n     - Total value = 695\\n   \\n   Since 695 is less than my outside offer of 962, this particular division does not work. I should aim to keep more valuable items.\\n\\n   **Improved Counteroffer Attempt:**\\n   - Possible offer to Player 2: [2, 0, 3, 0, 1] (I keep [4, 1, 5, 2, 2])\\n   - Calculate my total value:\\n     - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \\u00d7 87 = 348\\n     - 1 units of item 2 = 1 \\u00d7 73 = 73\\n     - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \\u00d7 82 = 410\\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \\u00d7 28 = 56\\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \\u00d7 5 = 10\\n     - Total value = 897\\n   \\n   While 897 is still less than my outside offer but closer, this means I'm essentially not gaining more than the outside offer due to having no reduction in rounds yet.

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 74 for item 1, 61 for item 2, 31 for item 3, 61 for item 4, 35 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 882. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 754. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 754. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 786 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 754.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\

    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 8, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 74 for item 1, 61 for item 2, 31 for item 3, 61 for item 4, 35 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 882. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 754. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 754. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 786 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 754.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 3, 0, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 62 for item 1, 46 for item 2, 95 for item 3, 69 for item 4, 21 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1218. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 49. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 49. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 879 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 49.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

Game 10, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 54 for item 1, 86 for item 2, 35 for item 3, 49 for item 4, 47 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 901. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 548. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 548. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 548.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Your private values are 34 for item 1, 53 for item 2, 58 for item 3, 14 for item 4, 28 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 480. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 221. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 221. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 10, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 34 for item 1, 53 for item 2, 58 for item 3, 14 for item 4, 28 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 480. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 221. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 221. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 561 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 221.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 33 for item 1, 7 for item 2, 95 for item 3, 6 for item 4, 23 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 441. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 171. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 171. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 492 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 171.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    2) Then, let's calculate:\

    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\

\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 13 for item 1, 55 for item 2, 77 for item 3, 93 for item 4, 17 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 457. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 329. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 329. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 765 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 329.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 12, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 6 for item 1, 67 for item 2, 14 for item 3, 54 for item 4, 80 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 960. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 325. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 325. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 663 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 325.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\

Game 13, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 72 for item 1, 62 for item 2, 24 for item 3, 5 for item 4, 34 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 817. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 84. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 84. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 591 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 84.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 6 for item 1, 92 for item 2, 56 for item 3, 47 for item 4, 8 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 836. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 94. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 453 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 434.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 6 for item 1, 92 for item 2, 56 for item 3, 47 for item 4, 8 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 836. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 94. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 94. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 627 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 94.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 40 for item 1, 75 for item 2, 28 for item 3, 88 for item 4, 78 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1254. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 310. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 310. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 927 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 310.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 15, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 57 for item 1, 95 for item 2, 67 for item 3, 57 for item 4, 47 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1558. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1373. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1373. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 969 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1373.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Therefore, accepting is not optimal.\\n   - Since the negotiated value (818) is much less than my outside offer, better offers than the current one are necessary.\\n   - Whether to make a counteroffer depends on exploring alternative distributions that might improve upon 818 but the current proposal is not close enough to motivate such compromise. \\n\\nGiven the above analysis, the logical choice is to make a counteroffer that reflects a more favorable division based on maximizing my value, but since the proposed division by Player 1 is too far off from my outside offer, any near-equal or slightly favorable counteroffer would also likely not match the outside offer adjusted with the discount factor. Hence, to effectively secure an acceptable solution, walking away in this scenario prioritizes my assured outside offer over speculative negotiation rounds.\\n\\nTherefore, the final decision is:\\n\\n```json\\n\{\\"action\\": \\"WALK\\"\}\\n```",\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 71 for item 1, 100 for item 2, 68 for item 3, 40 for item 4, 93 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 963. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 909. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 909. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1116 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 909.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 54 for item 1, 87 for item 2, 82 for item 3, 8 for item 4, 40 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 782. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 506. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 506. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 506.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 12 for item 1, 12 for item 2, 87 for item 3, 96 for item 4, 40 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1030. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 714. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 741 (sum of all item values)\

    This would be greater than your outside offer of 714.\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 506. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 506.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 3, 0]\

    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 2, 0]\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 32 for item 1, 70 for item 2, 93 for item 3, 18 for item 4, 94 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 651. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 257. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 257. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 921 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 257.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 51 for item 1, 45 for item 2, 43 for item 3, 20 for item 4, 76 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 714. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 365. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 365. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 365.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 44 for item 1, 89 for item 2, 43 for item 3, 30 for item 4, 25 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 746. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 423. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 423. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 693 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 423.\
\

Game 19, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 44 for item 1, 89 for item 2, 43 for item 3, 30 for item 4, 25 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 746. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 423. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 423. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 693 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 423.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 5, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 2, 2, 1]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 4, 3, 1]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 4, 3, 1]\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \

    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 73 for item 1, 7 for item 2, 77 for item 3, 13 for item 4, 1 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 505. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 370. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 370. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 513 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 370.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\

    - What are my item values?\

    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\

    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 100 for item 1, 13 for item 2, 54 for item 3, 11 for item 4, 87 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 747. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 135. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 135. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 135.\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 35 for item 1, 37 for item 2, 65 for item 3, 92 for item 4, 85 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 959. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 779. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 779. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 942 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 779.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \

    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 17 for item 1, 70 for item 2, 28 for item 3, 30 for item 4, 38 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 621. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 54. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 54. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 549 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 54.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\

    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\

\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 53 for item 1, 98 for item 2, 94 for item 3, 26 for item 4, 13 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 775. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 379. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 379. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 852 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 379.\
\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 22, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 81 for item 1, 78 for item 2, 51 for item 3, 25 for item 4, 57 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 736. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 245. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 245. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 876 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 245.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 775. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 379. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 53 for item 1, 98 for item 2, 94 for item 3, 26 for item 4, 13 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 775. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 379. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 379. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 852 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 379.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 16 for item 1, 50 for item 2, 45 for item 3, 80 for item 4, 42 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 872. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 57. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 57. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 699 (sum of all item values)\

    This would be greater than your outside offer of 57.\

    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Game 24, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 43 for item 1, 97 for item 2, 53 for item 3, 78 for item 4, 69 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1304. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 329. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 329. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1020 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 329.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1020 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 329.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 25, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 92 for item 1, 30 for item 2, 42 for item 3, 55 for item 4, 60 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 726. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 588. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 588. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 837 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 588.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

Game 25, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 92 for item 1, 30 for item 2, 42 for item 3, 55 for item 4, 60 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 726. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 588. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 588. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 837 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 588.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 3, 3, 1]\

Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 3, 3, 1]\
    \

    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

However, since all attempts to divide currently didn't meet at least a 588 value after applying a 0.9 discount, a promising strategy is to aggressively counter or evaluate, but given the likely scenarios and constraints such as upcoming discounting effects, it\\u2019s optimal to stick to the outside offer in expectation of significant counter-responses being unjustly less enticing.\\n\\n### Decision:\\nGiven the current offer is undervalued and likely strategies might not securely meet the threshold, the optimal compensation result guarantees adherence to the reserve offer.\\n\\nThus, the action is:\\n\\n```json\\n\{\\"action\\": \\"WALK\\"\}\\n```",\

================================================================================\
Game 26, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 60 for item 1, 9 for item 2, 84 for item 3, 86 for item 4, 73 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 933. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 526. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 526. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 936 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 526.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 54 for item 1, 54 for item 2, 2 for item 3, 96 for item 4, 18 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 668. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 493. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 493. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 672 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 493.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 96 for item 1, 25 for item 2, 16 for item 3, 25 for item 4, 36 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 786. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 631. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

Game 27, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 71 for item 1, 4 for item 2, 69 for item 3, 21 for item 4, 71 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1171. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1021. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1021. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1021.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 22 for item 1, 88 for item 2, 15 for item 3, 75 for item 4, 77 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 987. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 404. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 404. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 831 (sum of all item values)\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1126. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 396. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 396. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 855 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 396.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 7 for item 1, 29 for item 2, 97 for item 3, 61 for item 4, 85 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 749. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 162. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 162. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 837 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 162.\

Game 30, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 4 for item 1, 85 for item 2, 93 for item 3, 95 for item 4, 2 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 998. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 221. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 221. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 837 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 221.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 81 for item 1, 72 for item 2, 90 for item 3, 12 for item 4, 56 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 826. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 172. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 172. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 933 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 172.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 31, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 40 for item 1, 32 for item 2, 25 for item 3, 67 for item 4, 14 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 572. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 156. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 156. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 534 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 156.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 33 for item 1, 96 for item 2, 98 for item 3, 58 for item 4, 90 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1236. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1000. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1000. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1125 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 1000.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\

    Your outside offer value is 301. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 301. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 390 (sum of all item values)\
    \

Game 32, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 46 for item 1, 64 for item 2, 10 for item 3, 11 for item 4, 50 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 319. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 303. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 303. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 543 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 303.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 64 for item 1, 43 for item 2, 66 for item 3, 16 for item 4, 60 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1267. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 678. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 747 (sum of all item values)\

Game 33, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 64 for item 1, 43 for item 2, 66 for item 3, 16 for item 4, 60 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1267. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 678. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 678. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 747 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 678.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 2, 1, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\

    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 61 for item 1, 95 for item 2, 37 for item 3, 17 for item 4, 2 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 554. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 29. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 29. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 636 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 29.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    2) Then, let's calculate:\

    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 636 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 29.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 47 for item 1, 63 for item 2, 71 for item 3, 5 for item 4, 10 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 958. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 684. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 684. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 588 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 684.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 47 for item 1, 63 for item 2, 71 for item 3, 5 for item 4, 10 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 958. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 684. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 684. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 588 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 684.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 5, 0]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 5, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 46 for item 1, 83 for item 2, 22 for item 3, 71 for item 4, 69 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1217. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 357. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 357. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 357.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

================================================================================\
Game 36, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 46 for item 1, 83 for item 2, 22 for item 3, 71 for item 4, 69 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1217. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 357. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 357. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 357.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 3, 2]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [4, 1, 0, 5, 2]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 1, 0, 5, 2]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 15 for item 1, 11 for item 2, 66 for item 3, 77 for item 4, 96 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1182. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 769. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 769. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 15 for item 1, 11 for item 2, 66 for item 3, 77 for item 4, 96 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1182. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 769. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 769. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 769.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [3, 6, 0, 0, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 3, 3, 2]\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 769.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 63 for item 1, 36 for item 2, 73 for item 3, 77 for item 4, 87 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1004. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 115. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 115. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1008 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 115.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\

    Your private values are 63 for item 1, 36 for item 2, 73 for item 3, 77 for item 4, 87 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1004. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 115. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 115. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1008 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 115.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 1, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\

Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\

    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

Game 38, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 46 for item 1, 22 for item 2, 97 for item 3, 35 for item 4, 66 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 757. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 734. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 734. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 734.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\

\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 33 for item 1, 72 for item 2, 8 for item 3, 49 for item 4, 19 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 204. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 79. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 79. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 543 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 79.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

Game 39, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 40 for item 1, 67 for item 2, 87 for item 3, 49 for item 4, 23 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 585. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 385. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 385. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 385.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 204. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 79. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 543 (sum of all item values)\

================================================================================\
Game 40, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 91 for item 1, 48 for item 2, 4 for item 3, 61 for item 4, 99 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1212. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 784. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 784. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 909 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 784.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 20 for item 1, 90 for item 2, 35 for item 3, 41 for item 4, 7 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 827. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 704. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 704. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 579 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 704.\

Game 40, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 20 for item 1, 90 for item 2, 35 for item 3, 41 for item 4, 7 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 827. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 704. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 704. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 579 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 704.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 4, 0, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 2, 2, 5]\

    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 2, 1, 0]\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 51 for item 1, 72 for item 2, 85 for item 3, 93 for item 4, 37 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 804. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 626. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 626. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1014 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 626.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 86 for item 1, 100 for item 2, 15 for item 3, 79 for item 4, 11 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 789. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 146. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 146. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 146.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\

Game 42, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 33 for item 1, 60 for item 2, 35 for item 3, 83 for item 4, 11 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 791. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 738. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 738. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 666 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 738.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 99 for item 1, 99 for item 2, 18 for item 3, 86 for item 4, 94 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1948. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 495. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 495. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1188 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 495.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 443.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 71 for item 1, 91 for item 2, 10 for item 3, 7 for item 4, 1 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 713. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 409. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 409. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 540 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 409.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 888 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 400.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 18 for item 1, 27 for item 2, 39 for item 3, 89 for item 4, 84 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 965. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 518. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 518. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 771 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 518.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 45, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 18 for item 1, 27 for item 2, 39 for item 3, 89 for item 4, 84 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 965. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 518. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 518. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 771 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 518.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 2, 1]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 3, 4]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 3, 4]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

Game 46, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 9 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 37 for item 1, 50 for item 2, 54 for item 3, 91 for item 4, 46 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1384. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 940. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 940. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 834 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 940.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Round 1 Values:\

================================================================================\
Game 46, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 9 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 37 for item 1, 50 for item 2, 54 for item 3, 91 for item 4, 46 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1384. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 940. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 940. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 834 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 940.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 1, 3]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 2, 2]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 2, 2]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

Game 48, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 44 for item 1, 8 for item 2, 22 for item 3, 70 for item 4, 98 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1237. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 316. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 316. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 726 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 316.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 55 for item 1, 75 for item 2, 18 for item 3, 30 for item 4, 58 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 760. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 677. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 677.\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\

    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 86 for item 1, 63 for item 2, 98 for item 3, 50 for item 4, 15 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1081. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 496. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 496. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 936 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 496.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 10 for item 1, 24 for item 2, 12 for item 3, 79 for item 4, 51 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 709. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 668. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 668. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 528 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 668.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 69 for item 1, 64 for item 2, 9 for item 3, 23 for item 4, 95 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1140. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1033. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1033. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 780 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1033.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 51, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 53 for item 1, 61 for item 2, 23 for item 3, 64 for item 4, 78 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1136. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 549. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 549. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 837 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 549.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 47 for item 1, 56 for item 2, 90 for item 3, 67 for item 4, 22 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 861. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 325. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 325. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 846 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 325.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

Game 52, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 21 for item 1, 29 for item 2, 17 for item 3, 55 for item 4, 13 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 423. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 114. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 114. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 405 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 114.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 73 for item 1, 10 for item 2, 66 for item 3, 18 for item 4, 94 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1180. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 374. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 374. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 783 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 374.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\

Game 54, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 53 for item 1, 55 for item 2, 32 for item 3, 54 for item 4, 94 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1124. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 944. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 944. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 864 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 944.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

My goal is to make an offer so that the value I retain is close to or exceeds my outside offer after applying the discount factor in subsequent rounds.\\n\\nTo construct a reasonable counteroffer, consider that my total items are 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5. I want to ensure the value to me is substantial:\\n\\nLet\\u2019s try a potential offer to Player 2:\\n\\n- Offer 0 units of item 1 (I keep 3 units)\\n- Offer 1 unit of item 2 (I keep 4 units)\\n- Offer 4 units of item 3 (I keep 0 units)\\n- Offer 4 units of item 4 (I keep 0 units)\\n- Offer 2 units of item 5 (I keep 3 units)\\n\\n**Calculating my value:**\\n- I keep 3 units of item 1: 3 \\u00d7 53 = 159\\n- I keep 4 units of item 2: 4 \\u00d7 55 = 220\\n- I keep 0 units of item 3: 0 \\u00d7 32 = 0\\n- I keep 0 units of item 4: 0 \\u00d7 54 = 0\\n- I keep 3 units of item 5: 3 \\u00d7 94 = 282\\n\\nTotal value = 159 + 220 + 0 + 0 + 282 = 661\\n\\nThis value is significantly below my outside offer of 944. Therefore, I should NOT proceed with a counteroffer that retains less value for myself than my outside option.\\n\\n3) **Decision:**\\n\\nGiven that any reasonable counteroffer I can conceive doesn't meet or beat my outside offer value, and since it's the first round, it seems too early to walk away without testing the counteroffer possibility. Nonetheless, to protect my interests, let's proceed with counteroffering more aggressively to at least test Player 2's response.\\n\\nLet's revise and make sure the offer remains slightly competitive while keeping my interest in place. \\n\\nLet's offer:\\n\\n- Item 1: 0 units\\n- Item 2: 0 units\\n- Item 3: 4 units\\n- Item 4: 3 units\\n- Item 5: 0 units\\n\\nResulting in keeping 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 5 units of item 5\\n\\n**Calculating new value:**\\n- I keep 3 units of item 1: 3 \\u00d7 53 = 159\\n- I keep 5 units of item 2: 5 \\u00d7 55 = 275\\n- I keep 0 units of item 3: 0 \\u00d7 32 = 0\\n- I keep 1 units of item 4: 1 \\u00d7 54 = 54\\n- I keep 5 units of item 5: 5 \\u00d7 94 = 470\\n\\nTotal value = 159 + 275 + 0 + 54 + 470 = 958\\n\\nThis value is now favorable compared to my outside offer.

================================================================================\
Game 55, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 97 for item 1, 33 for item 2, 59 for item 3, 53 for item 4, 36 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1905. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1604. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1604. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 834 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1604.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 0, 2]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 0, 2]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 54 for item 1, 7 for item 2, 55 for item 3, 80 for item 4, 19 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 626. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 389. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 389. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 645 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 389.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

Game 57, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 50 for item 1, 4 for item 2, 36 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 32 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 540. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 43. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 43. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 543 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 43.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

Game 58, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 28 for item 1, 78 for item 2, 7 for item 3, 5 for item 4, 27 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 442. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 3. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 3. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 435 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 3.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Your outside offer value is 3. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\

\
    3) Let's decide:\

Game 59, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 93 for item 1, 68 for item 2, 94 for item 3, 38 for item 4, 18 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1452. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 32. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 32. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 933 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 32.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 19 for item 1, 55 for item 2, 68 for item 3, 52 for item 4, 6 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 676. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 82. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 82. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 600 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 82.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 81 for item 1, 51 for item 2, 47 for item 3, 66 for item 4, 22 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 928. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 511. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 511. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 511.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 3, 1, 1]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 3, 1, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 97 for item 1, 41 for item 2, 55 for item 3, 33 for item 4, 66 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1012. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 562. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 562. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 876 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 562.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 6 for item 1, 21 for item 2, 52 for item 3, 99 for item 4, 12 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 602. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 328. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 328. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 570 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 328.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1012. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 562. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 876 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 562.\

    Your private values are 6 for item 1, 21 for item 2, 52 for item 3, 99 for item 4, 12 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 602. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 328. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 328. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 570 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 328.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\

Game 62, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 84 for item 1, 40 for item 2, 30 for item 3, 65 for item 4, 52 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1333. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1133. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1133. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1133.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 36 for item 1, 26 for item 2, 9 for item 3, 2 for item 4, 26 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 486. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 97. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

Game 63, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 19 for item 1, 46 for item 2, 66 for item 3, 14 for item 4, 93 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 744. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 50. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 50. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 714 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 50.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 3 for item 1, 46 for item 2, 16 for item 3, 12 for item 4, 91 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 604. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 312. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 312. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 504 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 312.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\

Game 64, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 86 for item 1, 51 for item 2, 1 for item 3, 53 for item 4, 88 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 867. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 375. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 375. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 837 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 375.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Game 65, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 41 for item 1, 53 for item 2, 52 for item 3, 32 for item 4, 65 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1028. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 957. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 957. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 957.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 37 for item 1, 47 for item 2, 22 for item 3, 8 for item 4, 63 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 732. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 544. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 544. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 531 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 544.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 2 for item 1, 2 for item 2, 3 for item 3, 57 for item 4, 21 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 238. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 79. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 79. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 255 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 79.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    Your outside offer value is 505. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

================================================================================\
Game 68, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 58 for item 1, 71 for item 2, 55 for item 3, 78 for item 4, 85 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1388. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 991. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 991. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1041 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 991.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \

    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 19 for item 1, 28 for item 2, 73 for item 3, 98 for item 4, 11 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1071. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 666. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 666. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 687 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 666.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\

    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

================================================================================\
Game 68, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 58 for item 1, 71 for item 2, 55 for item 3, 78 for item 4, 85 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1388. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 991. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 991. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1041 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 991.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 2, 1, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 5, 1, 2]\

Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 5, 1, 2]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\

    - WALK to walk away\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1071. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 666. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 687 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 666.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 91 for item 1, 14 for item 2, 18 for item 3, 19 for item 4, 43 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 517. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 295. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 295. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

Game 69, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 75 for item 1, 20 for item 2, 23 for item 3, 57 for item 4, 98 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 650. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 185. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 185. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 819 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 185.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 52 for item 1, 35 for item 2, 43 for item 3, 40 for item 4, 22 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 553. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 213. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 213. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 576 (sum of all item values)\

Game 70, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 52 for item 1, 35 for item 2, 43 for item 3, 40 for item 4, 22 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 553. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 213. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 213. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 576 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 213.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 2, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 5, 3]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 5, 3]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 13 for item 1, 71 for item 2, 59 for item 3, 93 for item 4, 21 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 766. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 710. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 710. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 771 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 710.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 80 for item 1, 79 for item 2, 15 for item 3, 31 for item 4, 80 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 855. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 503. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 503. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 855 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 503.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 71, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 13 for item 1, 71 for item 2, 59 for item 3, 93 for item 4, 21 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 766. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 710. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 710. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 771 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 710.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 80 for item 1, 79 for item 2, 15 for item 3, 31 for item 4, 80 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 855. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 503. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 503. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 855 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 503.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 771 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 710.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 22 for item 1, 56 for item 2, 30 for item 3, 6 for item 4, 40 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 461. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 256. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 256. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 462 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 256.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 562. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 147. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 147. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 609 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 147.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 56 for item 1, 76 for item 2, 89 for item 3, 21 for item 4, 1 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 575. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 542. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 542. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 542.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

Game 74, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 63 for item 1, 35 for item 2, 10 for item 3, 96 for item 4, 60 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1101. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 794. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 794. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 792 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 794.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 4, 2]\
    \

    \
    What is your action? You can:\

    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 24 for item 1, 69 for item 2, 73 for item 3, 19 for item 4, 78 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1126. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 143. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 143. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 789 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 143.\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 93 for item 1, 28 for item 2, 41 for item 3, 98 for item 4, 14 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 821. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 85. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 85. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 822 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 85.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 75, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 34 for item 1, 98 for item 2, 17 for item 3, 80 for item 4, 67 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1185. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 80. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 80. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 888 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 80.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 4, 0, 3]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 4, 0, 3]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 5 for item 1, 21 for item 2, 76 for item 3, 85 for item 4, 21 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 477. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 463. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 463. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 624 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 463.\

    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\

    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 76, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 5 for item 1, 21 for item 2, 76 for item 3, 85 for item 4, 21 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 477. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 463. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 463. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 624 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 463.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 42 for item 1, 42 for item 2, 97 for item 3, 70 for item 4, 54 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 831. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 1 for item 1, 54 for item 2, 95 for item 3, 88 for item 4, 27 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 660. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 655. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 655. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 655.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 79, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 82 for item 1, 52 for item 2, 89 for item 3, 67 for item 4, 93 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1269. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1085. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1085. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1149 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 1085.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

Game 80, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 10 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 86 for item 1, 80 for item 2, 17 for item 3, 86 for item 4, 14 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1152. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 57. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 57. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 849 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 57.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 50 for item 1, 61 for item 2, 18 for item 3, 86 for item 4, 30 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 718. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 642. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 642. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 735 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 642.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 916. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 350. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 350. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 981 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 350.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    \
    What is your action? You can:\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 50 for item 1, 61 for item 2, 18 for item 3, 86 for item 4, 30 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 718. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 642. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 642. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 735 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 642.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 66 for item 1, 37 for item 2, 47 for item 3, 32 for item 4, 22 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 817. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 740. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 612 (sum of all item values)\

    This would be less than your outside offer of 740.\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 73 for item 1, 17 for item 2, 51 for item 3, 3 for item 4, 88 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 856. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 703. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 703. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 696 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 703.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 66 for item 1, 37 for item 2, 47 for item 3, 32 for item 4, 22 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 817. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 740. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 740. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 612 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 740.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Round 2 Values:\

================================================================================\
Game 82, Round 3, Player 1's turn (Step 5)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 66 for item 1, 37 for item 2, 47 for item 3, 32 for item 4, 22 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 817. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 740. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 740. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 612 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 740.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 3]\
Round 2: Player 2 offered [5, 0, 0, 3, 0]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 0, 0, 3, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 7 for item 1, 21 for item 2, 6 for item 3, 67 for item 4, 15 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 353. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 18. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 18. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 348 (sum of all item values)\

Game 84, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 75 for item 1, 88 for item 2, 15 for item 3, 61 for item 4, 84 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 377. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 350. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 350. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 969 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 350.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 43 for item 1, 37 for item 2, 33 for item 3, 96 for item 4, 68 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 476. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 300. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 300. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 831 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 300.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\

    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 84, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 43 for item 1, 37 for item 2, 33 for item 3, 96 for item 4, 68 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 476. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 300. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 300. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 831 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 300.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 2, 0]\

    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 75 for item 1, 88 for item 2, 15 for item 3, 61 for item 4, 84 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 377. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 350. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 350. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 969 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 350.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 61 for item 1, 64 for item 2, 36 for item 3, 36 for item 4, 75 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 815. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 670. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 670. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 816 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 670.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 6 for item 1, 23 for item 2, 4 for item 3, 40 for item 4, 68 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 504. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 377. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 377. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 423 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 377.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\

Game 86, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 10 for item 1, 83 for item 2, 84 for item 3, 4 for item 4, 48 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 842. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 121. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 121. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 687 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 121.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 31 for item 1, 77 for item 2, 88 for item 3, 98 for item 4, 98 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1784. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1001. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1001. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1176 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 1001.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 10 for item 1, 62 for item 2, 37 for item 3, 67 for item 4, 66 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 588. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 438. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 438. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 726 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 438.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\

    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\

Game 89, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 28 for item 1, 81 for item 2, 96 for item 3, 94 for item 4, 43 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 874. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 739. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 739. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1026 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 739.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

Game 89, Round 3, Player 1's turn (Step 5)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 10 for item 1, 62 for item 2, 37 for item 3, 67 for item 4, 66 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 588. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 438. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 438. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 726 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 438.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [4, 1, 1, 1, 0]\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 28 for item 1, 81 for item 2, 96 for item 3, 94 for item 4, 43 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 874. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 739. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1026 (sum of all item values)\

    This would be greater than your outside offer of 739.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 90 for item 1, 67 for item 2, 6 for item 3, 89 for item 4, 34 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1151. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 871. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 871. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 858 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 871.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 79 for item 1, 69 for item 2, 29 for item 3, 45 for item 4, 89 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1062. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 319. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 319. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 933 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 319.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    Your outside offer value is 871. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 750. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 564 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 750.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Game 92, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 99 for item 1, 75 for item 2, 61 for item 3, 60 for item 4, 1 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 931. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 266. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 266. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 888 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 266.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\

    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 52 for item 1, 77 for item 2, 61 for item 3, 55 for item 4, 69 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1140. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 620. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 620. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 942 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 620.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    2) Then, let's calculate:\

Game 92, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 99 for item 1, 75 for item 2, 61 for item 3, 60 for item 4, 1 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 931. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 266. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 266. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 888 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 266.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 1, 4]\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

Game 92, Round 3, Player 2's turn (Step 6)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 52 for item 1, 77 for item 2, 61 for item 3, 55 for item 4, 69 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1140. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 620. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 620. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 942 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 620.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 1, 4]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 2, 2, 3]\

    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 56 for item 1, 69 for item 2, 50 for item 3, 49 for item 4, 73 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1184. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 670. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 670. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 891 (sum of all item values)\

    There are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 30 for item 1, 55 for item 2, 80 for item 3, 30 for item 4, 93 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1072. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 450. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 450. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 864 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 450.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\

Game 94, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 90 for item 1, 38 for item 2, 69 for item 3, 83 for item 4, 59 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1585. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 252. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 252. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1017 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 252.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 3, 3]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 3, 2]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 3, 2]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

Game 95, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 100 for item 1, 49 for item 2, 7 for item 3, 51 for item 4, 28 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 761. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 44. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 44. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 44.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 50 for item 1, 85 for item 2, 78 for item 3, 39 for item 4, 28 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 945. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 205. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 205. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 840 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 205.\

    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 11 for item 1, 100 for item 2, 40 for item 3, 56 for item 4, 33 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 704. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 266. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 266. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 720 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 266.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 8 for item 1, 95 for item 2, 72 for item 3, 68 for item 4, 81 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 944. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 641. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 972 (sum of all item values)\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 846 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 161.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 63 for item 1, 55 for item 2, 18 for item 3, 66 for item 4, 81 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1328. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 150. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 150. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 849 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 150.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    Your outside offer value is 371. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 256.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 73 for item 1, 13 for item 2, 7 for item 3, 78 for item 4, 25 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 809. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 493. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 493. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 588 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 493.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 73 for item 1, 13 for item 2, 7 for item 3, 78 for item 4, 25 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 809. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 493. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 493. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 588 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 493.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 85 for item 1, 80 for item 2, 43 for item 3, 78 for item 4, 22 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1288. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 256. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 256. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 256.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\

\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 16 for item 1, 60 for item 2, 34 for item 3, 65 for item 4, 34 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 487. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 25. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 25. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 627 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 25.\

Game 100, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 31 for item 1, 40 for item 2, 74 for item 3, 37 for item 4, 74 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 633. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 293. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 293. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 768 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 293.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 16 for item 1, 60 for item 2, 34 for item 3, 65 for item 4, 34 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 487. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 90% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 25. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 25. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 627 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 25.\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
