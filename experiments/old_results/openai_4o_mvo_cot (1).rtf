Game 1, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 87 for item 1, 4 for item 2, 88 for item 3, 77 for item 4, 54 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 840. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 840. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 930 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 840.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 15 for item 1, 40 for item 2, 66 for item 3, 25 for item 4, 15 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 930. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 930. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 483 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 930.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 92 for item 1, 56 for item 2, 89 for item 3, 40 for item 4, 10 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 336. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 336. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 861 (sum of all item values)\

    This would be greater than your outside offer of 336.\

Game 2, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 69 for item 1, 94 for item 2, 70 for item 3, 93 for item 4, 85 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 517. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 517. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1233 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 517.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 0, 4]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 0, 4]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\

    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 31 for item 1, 43 for item 2, 59 for item 3, 85 for item 4, 25 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 38. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 38. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\

    This would be greater than your outside offer of 38.\

    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\

================================================================================\
Game 4, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 77 for item 1, 62 for item 2, 55 for item 3, 30 for item 4, 20 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 418. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 418. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 418.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 44 for item 1, 36 for item 2, 93 for item 3, 52 for item 4, 51 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 449. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 449. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 828 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 449.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    Your outside offer value is 418. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 418. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 418.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 1, 3]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]\

Game 4, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 44 for item 1, 36 for item 2, 93 for item 3, 52 for item 4, 51 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 449. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 449. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 828 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 449.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 53 for item 1, 80 for item 2, 44 for item 3, 90 for item 4, 21 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 950. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 950. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 864 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 950.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\

Game 6, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 27 for item 1, 43 for item 2, 63 for item 3, 37 for item 4, 79 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 364. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 364. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 747 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 364.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 4 for item 1, 35 for item 2, 84 for item 3, 62 for item 4, 92 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 686. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 686. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 831 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 686.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\

    Your private values are 27 for item 1, 43 for item 2, 63 for item 3, 37 for item 4, 79 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 364. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 364. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 747 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 364.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

Game 6, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 4 for item 1, 35 for item 2, 84 for item 3, 62 for item 4, 92 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 686. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 686. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 831 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 686.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \

Game 7, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 64 for item 1, 5 for item 2, 33 for item 3, 34 for item 4, 83 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 357. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 357. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 357.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

Game 7, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 45 for item 1, 30 for item 2, 27 for item 3, 71 for item 4, 48 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 394. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 394. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 663 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 394.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 3, 1, 3]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 3, 1, 3]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\

    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 31 for item 1, 69 for item 2, 28 for item 3, 50 for item 4, 88 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 255. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 255. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 255.\

================================================================================\
Game 8, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 31 for item 1, 69 for item 2, 28 for item 3, 50 for item 4, 88 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 255. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 255. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 255.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 2]\

    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 451. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 451. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\

Game 8, Round 3, Player 1's turn (Step 5)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 31 for item 1, 69 for item 2, 28 for item 3, 50 for item 4, 88 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 255. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 255. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 255.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 60 for item 1, 86 for item 2, 8 for item 3, 68 for item 4, 28 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 307. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 307. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 307.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\

    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 64 for item 1, 71 for item 2, 38 for item 3, 64 for item 4, 13 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 60. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 60. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\

    This would be greater than your outside offer of 60.\

Game 10, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 5 for item 1, 3 for item 2, 72 for item 3, 57 for item 4, 4 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 77. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 77. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 423 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 77.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

    \

    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 35 for item 1, 96 for item 2, 99 for item 3, 14 for item 4, 73 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 708. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 708. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 951 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 708.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 11, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 59 for item 1, 10 for item 2, 95 for item 3, 80 for item 4, 6 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 294. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 294. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 294.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\

    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 275. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 275. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 834 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 275.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 12, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 9 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 39 for item 1, 27 for item 2, 2 for item 3, 57 for item 4, 64 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 756. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 756. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 567 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 756.\

Game 13, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 57 for item 1, 71 for item 2, 81 for item 3, 50 for item 4, 67 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 443. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 443. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 978 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 443.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 0, 0, 1]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 5, 0, 0, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\

    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 57 for item 1, 13 for item 2, 61 for item 3, 6 for item 4, 36 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 92. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 92. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 519 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 92.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\

    Your outside offer value is 618. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\

Game 15, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 25 for item 1, 96 for item 2, 35 for item 3, 32 for item 4, 17 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 469. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 469. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 615 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 469.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 46 for item 1, 33 for item 2, 13 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 13 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 204. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 204. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 492 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 204.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 39 for item 1, 83 for item 2, 11 for item 3, 32 for item 4, 44 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 676. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 676. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 627 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 676.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

Game 17, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 93 for item 1, 10 for item 2, 35 for item 3, 37 for item 4, 6 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 873. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 873. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 543 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 873.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\

    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

Game 18, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 77 for item 1, 9 for item 2, 31 for item 3, 2 for item 4, 57 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 74. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 74. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 528 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 74.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

Any change could worsen the situation or prolong negotiation into rounds 2 or more.\\n\\nThus, it's optimal to accept the current offer as it is better than any outside option and is already a strong value:\\n\\n```json\\n\{\\"action\\": \\"ACCEPT\\"\}\\n```",\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 23 for item 1, 98 for item 2, 53 for item 3, 31 for item 4, 28 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 316. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 316. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 699 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 316.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\

Game 19, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 78 for item 1, 8 for item 2, 49 for item 3, 80 for item 4, 58 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 8. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 8. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 819 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 8.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 23 for item 1, 98 for item 2, 53 for item 3, 31 for item 4, 28 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 316. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 316. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 699 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 316.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 78 for item 1, 8 for item 2, 49 for item 3, 80 for item 4, 58 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 8. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 8. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 819 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 8.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\

Game 20 of 100\
\
================================================================================\
Game 20, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 48 for item 1, 47 for item 2, 3 for item 3, 44 for item 4, 94 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 467. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 467. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 467.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 98 for item 1, 81 for item 2, 80 for item 3, 83 for item 4, 49 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 636. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 636. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1173 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 636.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Game 21, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 19 for item 1, 48 for item 2, 2 for item 3, 38 for item 4, 88 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 401. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 401. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 585 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 401.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 39 for item 1, 4 for item 2, 59 for item 3, 27 for item 4, 28 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 896. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 896. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 471 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 896.\

Game 23, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 72 for item 1, 63 for item 2, 80 for item 3, 89 for item 4, 16 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 260. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 260. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 960 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 260.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    \

    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

    Your private values are 63 for item 1, 92 for item 2, 57 for item 3, 92 for item 4, 61 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 83 for item 1, 18 for item 2, 82 for item 3, 18 for item 4, 57 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 584. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 584. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 774 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 584.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\

    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\

Game 24, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 35 for item 1, 7 for item 2, 44 for item 3, 83 for item 4, 70 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 198. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 198. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 717 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 198.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 0, 1]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 3, 0, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 83 for item 1, 18 for item 2, 82 for item 3, 18 for item 4, 57 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 584. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 584. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 774 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 584.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 717 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 198.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 0, 1]\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 83 for item 1, 18 for item 2, 82 for item 3, 18 for item 4, 57 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 584. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 584. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 774 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 584.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\

    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\

    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 5 for item 1, 37 for item 2, 33 for item 3, 6 for item 4, 52 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 586. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 586. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 399 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 586.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\

    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

Offering 3 units of Item 1 and 2 units of Item 4 to Player 2 guarantees me a value of 597, exceeding my outside offer of 586 without requiring concessions in higher-value items.\\n\\nThus, my action is:\\n\\n```json\\n\{\\"action\\": \\"COUNTEROFFER\\", \\"offer\\": [3, 0, 0, 2, 0]\}\\n```",\

Game 25, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 31 for item 1, 23 for item 2, 15 for item 3, 18 for item 4, 96 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 375. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 375. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 549 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 375.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 0, 2, 0]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 0, 2, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 5 for item 1, 37 for item 2, 33 for item 3, 6 for item 4, 52 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 586. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 586. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 399 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 586.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 3 for item 1, 76 for item 2, 74 for item 3, 60 for item 4, 14 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 330. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 330. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 330.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\

    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

================================================================================\
Game 26, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 23 for item 1, 29 for item 2, 23 for item 3, 92 for item 4, 17 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 455. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 455. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 552 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 455.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 2, 2, 1]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 2, 2, 2, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\

    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

Game 26, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 3 for item 1, 76 for item 2, 74 for item 3, 60 for item 4, 14 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 330. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 330. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 330.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\

\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\

Game 27, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 36 for item 1, 67 for item 2, 35 for item 3, 68 for item 4, 15 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 278. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 278. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 663 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 278.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 36 for item 1, 67 for item 2, 35 for item 3, 68 for item 4, 15 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 278. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 278. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 663 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 278.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [7, 0, 0, 0, 2]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [7, 0, 2, 0, 5]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [7, 0, 2, 0, 5]\

Game 28, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 17 for item 1, 72 for item 2, 34 for item 3, 86 for item 4, 47 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 821. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 821. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 768 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 821.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 90 for item 1, 83 for item 2, 78 for item 3, 86 for item 4, 73 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 232. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

Game 29, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 92 for item 1, 32 for item 2, 41 for item 3, 74 for item 4, 46 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 312. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 312. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 855 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 312.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 3]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 3]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 90 for item 1, 83 for item 2, 78 for item 3, 86 for item 4, 73 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 232. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 232. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1230 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 232.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

================================================================================\
Game 29, Round 3, Player 1's turn (Step 5)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 90 for item 1, 83 for item 2, 78 for item 3, 86 for item 4, 73 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 232. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 232. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1230 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 232.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 3]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    Your outside offer value is 658. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 30, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 48 for item 1, 7 for item 2, 66 for item 3, 55 for item 4, 4 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 176. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 176. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 540 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 176.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 83 for item 1, 76 for item 2, 96 for item 3, 81 for item 4, 18 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 947. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

Game 32, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 6 for item 1, 11 for item 2, 65 for item 3, 9 for item 4, 62 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 796. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 796. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 459 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 796.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 6 for item 1, 34 for item 2, 78 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 48 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 345. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 345. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 345.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    Your outside offer value is 165. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 549 (sum of all item values)\

================================================================================\
Game 34, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 81 for item 1, 32 for item 2, 17 for item 3, 36 for item 4, 63 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 388. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 388. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 687 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 388.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    This would be greater than your outside offer of 388.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

Game 35, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 29 for item 1, 13 for item 2, 40 for item 3, 55 for item 4, 89 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 440. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 440. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 678 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 440.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 28 for item 1, 86 for item 2, 53 for item 3, 50 for item 4, 100 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 749. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 749. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 951 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 749.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\

    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 9 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 35 for item 1, 91 for item 2, 63 for item 3, 78 for item 4, 70 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 620. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 620. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1011 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 620.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 9 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 35 for item 1, 91 for item 2, 63 for item 3, 78 for item 4, 70 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 620. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 620. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1011 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 620.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\

\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\

Game 37, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 60 for item 1, 5 for item 2, 29 for item 3, 20 for item 4, 39 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 113. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 113. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 459 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 113.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

Game 39, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 66 for item 1, 5 for item 2, 13 for item 3, 35 for item 4, 26 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 187. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 187. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 435 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 187.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

Game 40, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 5 for item 1, 55 for item 2, 91 for item 3, 8 for item 4, 100 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 269. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 269. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 777 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 269.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 35 for item 1, 88 for item 2, 41 for item 3, 24 for item 4, 32 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 294. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 294. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 660 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 294.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 54 for item 1, 24 for item 2, 44 for item 3, 38 for item 4, 60 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 681. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 681. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 660 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 681.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 42, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 56 for item 1, 73 for item 2, 26 for item 3, 31 for item 4, 56 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 834. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 834. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 726 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 834.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 32 for item 1, 49 for item 2, 37 for item 3, 68 for item 4, 33 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 967. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 4 for item 1, 9 for item 2, 21 for item 3, 28 for item 4, 79 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 284. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 284. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 423 (sum of all item values)\

    This would be greater than your outside offer of 284.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\

    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\

Game 44, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 63 for item 1, 74 for item 2, 16 for item 3, 8 for item 4, 94 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 777. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 777. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 765 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 777.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 90 for item 1, 66 for item 2, 79 for item 3, 39 for item 4, 74 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 150. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 150. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1044 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 150.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\

Game 45, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 94 for item 1, 93 for item 2, 5 for item 3, 18 for item 4, 24 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 642. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 642. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 702 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 642.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\

    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 80 for item 1, 37 for item 2, 65 for item 3, 34 for item 4, 75 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 579. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 579. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 579.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

================================================================================\
Game 46, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 80 for item 1, 37 for item 2, 65 for item 3, 34 for item 4, 75 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 579. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 579. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 579.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 5, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 2, 6, 1]\

    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1065 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 102.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Game 47, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 10 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 23 for item 1, 45 for item 2, 58 for item 3, 41 for item 4, 10 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 533. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 533. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 531 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 533.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\

    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\

\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 48, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 8 for item 1, 55 for item 2, 6 for item 3, 87 for item 4, 37 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 246. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 246. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 579 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 246.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 65 for item 1, 35 for item 2, 93 for item 3, 68 for item 4, 12 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 590. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 590. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 819 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 590.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 585 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 794.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Game 50, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 84 for item 1, 15 for item 2, 49 for item 3, 8 for item 4, 83 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 471. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 471. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 717 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 471.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

================================================================================\
Game 51, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 99 for item 1, 30 for item 2, 4 for item 3, 41 for item 4, 27 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 599. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 599. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 603 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 599.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 5 for item 1, 90 for item 2, 90 for item 3, 53 for item 4, 92 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 625. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 625. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 990 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 625.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

Game 52, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 44 for item 1, 44 for item 2, 98 for item 3, 36 for item 4, 35 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 842. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 842. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 771 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 842.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 82 for item 1, 95 for item 2, 74 for item 3, 63 for item 4, 64 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 737. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 737. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1134 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 737.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 44 for item 1, 5 for item 2, 20 for item 3, 51 for item 4, 91 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 150. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 150. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 633 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 150.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    It is now round 2.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 63 for item 1, 66 for item 2, 85 for item 3, 57 for item 4, 76 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 738. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1041 (sum of all item values)\

Game 54, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 71 for item 1, 35 for item 2, 5 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 76 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 550. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 550. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 738 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 550.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 1, 1]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 3, 1, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

Next, let's consider a counteroffer.\\n\\n#### Potential COUNTEROFFER\\nTo make a suitable counteroffer, we must ensure the total value of items we retain is greater than 550.\\n\\nAssume we want to keep items with the highest values per unit. For instance, maximizing on high-value items (like item 1 and item 5, which give us the highest unit values), let's try:\\n\\nPlan to keep:\\n- 2 units of item 1 = \\\\(2 \\\\times 71 = 142\\\\)\\n- 1 units of item 2 = \\\\(1 \\\\times 35 = 35\\\\)\\n- 0 units of item 3 = \\\\(0 \\\\times 5 = 0\\\\)\\n- 5 units of item 4 = \\\\(5 \\\\times 59 = 295\\\\)\\n- 1 units of item 5 = \\\\(1 \\\\times 76 = 76\\\\)\\n\\nTotal value = \\\\(142 + 35 + 0 + 295 + 76 = 548\\\\)\\n\\nAlthough this offer gives a value close to my outside offer, it does not exceed it. However, adjusting further would lower even more valued items. Let's consider an alternate balance that maximizes on keeping most valuable ones.\\n\\nKeep:\\n- 2 units of item 1\\n- 0 units of item 2\\n- 0 units of item 3\\n- 4 units of item 4\\n- 2 units of item 5\\n\\nThis counteroffer calculation:\\n- 2 units of item 1 = \\\\(2 \\\\times 71 = 142\\\\)\\n- 4 units of item 4 = \\\\(4 \\\\times 59 = 236\\\\)\\n- 2 units of item 5 = \\\\(2 \\\\times 76 = 152\\\\)\\n\\nTotal value = \\\\(142 + 0 + 0 + 236 + 152 = 530\\\\)\\n\\nOffer thus becomes: [0, 2, 7, 2, 0] for Player 1, leaving the items for me at total 530, slightly lower than my outside offer. I should revise until the number is above 550 or close enough.\\n\\n### Step 4: Decide the Action\\nSince neither the current offer nor the counteroffers that I drafted exceed my outside offer value of 550 significantly, I'll consider walking away.\\n\\nGiven this evaluation, my action will be:\\n\\n```json\\n\{\\"action\\": \\"WALK\\"\}\\n```",\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 16 for item 1, 98 for item 2, 82 for item 3, 57 for item 4, 12 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 80. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 80. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 80.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 275.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Game 55, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 16 for item 1, 98 for item 2, 82 for item 3, 57 for item 4, 12 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 80. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 80. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 80.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

================================================================================\
Game 55, Round 3, Player 1's turn (Step 5)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 16 for item 1, 98 for item 2, 82 for item 3, 57 for item 4, 12 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 80. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 80. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 80.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 2, 2]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 3, 1, 0]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 1]\
Round 2: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 63 for item 1, 82 for item 2, 31 for item 3, 96 for item 4, 23 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 893. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 893. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 885 (sum of all item values)\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 65 for item 1, 83 for item 2, 60 for item 3, 18 for item 4, 82 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 266. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 266. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 266.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

================================================================================\
Game 56, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 63 for item 1, 82 for item 2, 31 for item 3, 96 for item 4, 23 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 893. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 893. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 885 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 893.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 3, 0, 2]\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 85 for item 1, 19 for item 2, 31 for item 3, 36 for item 4, 51 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 992. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 992. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 666 (sum of all item values)\

Game 58, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 73 for item 1, 1 for item 2, 41 for item 3, 28 for item 4, 41 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 178. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 178. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 552 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 178.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 34 for item 1, 16 for item 2, 77 for item 3, 21 for item 4, 26 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 919. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 919. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 522 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 919.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\

    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 60, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 23 for item 1, 87 for item 2, 43 for item 3, 29 for item 4, 95 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 723. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 723. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 831 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 723.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 98 for item 1, 84 for item 2, 16 for item 3, 36 for item 4, 78 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 151. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 151. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 936 (sum of all item values)\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 18 for item 1, 29 for item 2, 43 for item 3, 75 for item 4, 23 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 210. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 210. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 564 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 210.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 98 for item 1, 84 for item 2, 16 for item 3, 36 for item 4, 78 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 151. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 151. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 936 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 151.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\

\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\

\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 18 for item 1, 29 for item 2, 43 for item 3, 75 for item 4, 23 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 210. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 564 (sum of all item values)\

================================================================================\
Game 62, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 67 for item 1, 100 for item 2, 72 for item 3, 84 for item 4, 69 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 712. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 712. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1176 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 712.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    \

    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 19 for item 1, 84 for item 2, 75 for item 3, 49 for item 4, 71 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 882. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 882. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 894 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 882.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\

Game 63, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 56 for item 1, 15 for item 2, 77 for item 3, 31 for item 4, 1 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 67. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 67. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 540 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 67.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 34 for item 1, 29 for item 2, 11 for item 3, 11 for item 4, 65 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 621. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 621. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 450 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 621.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 70 for item 1, 100 for item 2, 24 for item 3, 28 for item 4, 3 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 47. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 47. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 47.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\

Game 64, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 40 for item 1, 58 for item 2, 98 for item 3, 38 for item 4, 77 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 683. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 683. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 933 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 683.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 2, 2]\
    \

    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 70 for item 1, 100 for item 2, 24 for item 3, 28 for item 4, 3 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 47. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 47. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 47.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\

    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\

    There are 7 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 98 for item 1, 92 for item 2, 94 for item 3, 43 for item 4, 21 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 655. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 655. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1044 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 655.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

Game 65, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 80 for item 1, 66 for item 2, 91 for item 3, 39 for item 4, 81 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 54. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 54. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1071 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 54.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\

    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 5 for item 1, 44 for item 2, 12 for item 3, 94 for item 4, 96 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\

Game 66, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 46 for item 1, 71 for item 2, 46 for item 3, 94 for item 4, 99 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 163. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 163. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1068 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 163.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 3, 1]\
    \

    - WALK to walk away\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 89 for item 1, 74 for item 2, 90 for item 3, 98 for item 4, 60 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 419. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 419. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1233 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 419.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 45 for item 1, 48 for item 2, 14 for item 3, 70 for item 4, 65 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 792. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 792. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 726 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 792.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 68, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 94 for item 1, 98 for item 2, 26 for item 3, 38 for item 4, 56 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 234. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 234. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 936 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 234.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 783 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 664.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

Game 69, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 95 for item 1, 41 for item 2, 43 for item 3, 61 for item 4, 12 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 203. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 203. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 756 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 203.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\

\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 32 for item 1, 30 for item 2, 71 for item 3, 93 for item 4, 35 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 664. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 783 (sum of all item values)\

Game 70, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 14 for item 1, 8 for item 2, 61 for item 3, 81 for item 4, 79 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 306. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 306. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 306.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \

    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 44 for item 1, 27 for item 2, 69 for item 3, 56 for item 4, 52 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 235. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 235. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 744 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 235.\

Game 71, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 12 for item 1, 55 for item 2, 38 for item 3, 48 for item 4, 44 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 575. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 575. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 591 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 575.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 44 for item 1, 27 for item 2, 69 for item 3, 56 for item 4, 52 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 235. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 235. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 744 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 235.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\

\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\

    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 72, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 57 for item 1, 86 for item 2, 49 for item 3, 51 for item 4, 2 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 831. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 831. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 735 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 831.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    It is now round 1.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 17 for item 1, 98 for item 2, 34 for item 3, 20 for item 4, 51 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 612. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 612. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 660 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 612.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\

Game 73, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 83 for item 1, 61 for item 2, 38 for item 3, 19 for item 4, 50 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 278. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 278. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 753 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 278.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 96 for item 1, 37 for item 2, 86 for item 3, 29 for item 4, 18 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 10. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 10. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 10.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 11 for item 1, 100 for item 2, 25 for item 3, 53 for item 4, 1 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 955. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 955. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 570 (sum of all item values)\

Game 75, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 35 for item 1, 62 for item 2, 60 for item 3, 91 for item 4, 93 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 505. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 505. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1023 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 505.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 77 for item 1, 41 for item 2, 69 for item 3, 72 for item 4, 57 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 918. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 918. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 948 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 918.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\

    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\

    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

Game 76, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 9 for item 1, 64 for item 2, 41 for item 3, 57 for item 4, 42 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 579. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 579. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 639 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 579.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 88 for item 1, 54 for item 2, 15 for item 3, 24 for item 4, 42 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 500. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 500. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 669 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 500.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

Game 77, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 72 for item 1, 20 for item 2, 6 for item 3, 64 for item 4, 1 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 757. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 757. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 489 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 757.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 474. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 762 (sum of all item values)\

    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

================================================================================\
Game 79, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 77 for item 1, 73 for item 2, 69 for item 3, 28 for item 4, 54 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 172. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 172. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 903 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 172.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\

    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\

    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\

Game 79, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 77 for item 1, 73 for item 2, 69 for item 3, 28 for item 4, 54 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 172. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 172. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 903 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 172.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 3, 3]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 1, 1, 3]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 1, 3]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 40 for item 1, 51 for item 2, 42 for item 3, 85 for item 4, 70 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 194. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 194. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 864 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 194.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 80, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 82 for item 1, 98 for item 2, 73 for item 3, 21 for item 4, 81 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 174. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 174. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1065 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 174.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 78 for item 1, 81 for item 2, 100 for item 3, 79 for item 4, 68 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 918. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

Game 82, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 26 for item 1, 2 for item 2, 72 for item 3, 38 for item 4, 64 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 627. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 627. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 606 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 627.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 63 for item 1, 5 for item 2, 47 for item 3, 22 for item 4, 98 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 924. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 924. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 924.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 83, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 44 for item 1, 34 for item 2, 69 for item 3, 42 for item 4, 52 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 935. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 935. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 723 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 935.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 2, 0, 0]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 2, 0, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 63 for item 1, 5 for item 2, 47 for item 3, 22 for item 4, 98 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 924. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 924. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 924.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\

    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 324 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 562.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

Game 85, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 34 for item 1, 19 for item 2, 47 for item 3, 54 for item 4, 4 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 4. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 4. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 474 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 4.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 32 for item 1, 74 for item 2, 29 for item 3, 36 for item 4, 2 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 356. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 356. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 519 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 356.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\

================================================================================\
Game 85, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 34 for item 1, 19 for item 2, 47 for item 3, 54 for item 4, 4 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 4. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 4. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 474 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 4.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 3]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 1, 3]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 37 for item 1, 10 for item 2, 60 for item 3, 12 for item 4, 3 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 750. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 750. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 366 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 750.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\

    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\

    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 79 for item 1, 64 for item 2, 4 for item 3, 62 for item 4, 20 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 326. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 326. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 687 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 326.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\

Game 87, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 48 for item 1, 16 for item 2, 15 for item 3, 26 for item 4, 33 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 602. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 602. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 414 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 602.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 5, 2, 2]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 5, 2, 2]\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 31 for item 1, 48 for item 2, 63 for item 3, 93 for item 4, 84 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 221. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 221. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 957 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 221.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\

    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\

    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 22 for item 1, 21 for item 2, 87 for item 3, 83 for item 4, 84 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 274. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 274. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 891 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 274.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 49 for item 1, 85 for item 2, 84 for item 3, 41 for item 4, 79 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 438. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 438. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1014 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 438.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 73 for item 1, 18 for item 2, 91 for item 3, 91 for item 4, 15 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 222. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

Game 90, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 77 for item 1, 18 for item 2, 82 for item 3, 39 for item 4, 46 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 33. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 33. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 786 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 33.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Your outside offer value is 312. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 82 for item 1, 89 for item 2, 49 for item 3, 26 for item 4, 69 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 90. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 90. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

Game 91, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 12 for item 1, 96 for item 2, 32 for item 3, 94 for item 4, 75 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 908. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 908. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 927 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 908.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 2]\
    \

    Your outside offer value is 90. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 90. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 945 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 90.\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 12 for item 1, 96 for item 2, 32 for item 3, 94 for item 4, 75 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 908. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 908. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 927 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 908.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 2]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 84 for item 1, 23 for item 2, 85 for item 3, 18 for item 4, 90 for item 5.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 55 for item 1, 6 for item 2, 22 for item 3, 71 for item 4, 74 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 367. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 367. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 684 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 367.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\

Game 93, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 11 for item 1, 70 for item 2, 74 for item 3, 34 for item 4, 19 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 627. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 627. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 624 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 627.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

Game 94, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 70 for item 1, 57 for item 2, 53 for item 3, 2 for item 4, 25 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 630. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 630. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 621 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 630.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 67 for item 1, 35 for item 2, 52 for item 3, 35 for item 4, 57 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 254. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 254. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 738 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 254.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

================================================================================\
Game 95, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 13 for item 1, 33 for item 2, 67 for item 3, 86 for item 4, 18 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 382. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 382. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 651 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 382.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \

Game 96, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 87 for item 1, 16 for item 2, 54 for item 3, 30 for item 4, 98 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 163. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 163. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 855 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 163.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 86 for item 1, 96 for item 2, 35 for item 3, 75 for item 4, 89 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 314. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 314. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1143 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 314.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\

    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \

Game 98, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 21 for item 1, 1 for item 2, 58 for item 3, 46 for item 4, 60 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 154. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 154. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 558 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 154.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\

    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 16 for item 1, 81 for item 2, 53 for item 3, 94 for item 4, 100 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 364. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 7 for item 1, 85 for item 2, 17 for item 3, 30 for item 4, 35 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 262. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 262. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 522 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 262.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's evaluate the outcome:\
    - Compare the calculated values from step 2 for each possible action (ACCEPT/WALK/COUNTEROFFER).\
    - Identify which action gives me the highest value after accounting for discounting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER or ACCEPT, verify that my chosen action's value exceeds my outside offer.\
    - If choosing to WALK, verify that my outside offer value exceeds the value of the outcome of counter offering or accepting.\
    - If choosing to COUNTEROFFER, double check that my counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\
    - Explain why my chosen action is optimal compared to the alternatives.\
\
    4) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
    \
   \
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 48 for item 1, 8 for item 2, 63 for item 3, 100 for item 4, 36 for item 5.\
    Both you and Player 2 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\
    Your outside offer value is 846. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 846. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 765 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 846.\
    Only make offers where your portion has greater value than your outside offer.\
