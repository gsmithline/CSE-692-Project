My total full value for everything is 1299, so I have a \u201csacrifice margin\u201d of 1299 \u2013 1140 = 159 \u201cvalue units\u201d that I\u2019m willing to give away. I prefer to give up items that are lower in my private value so I keep most of the high\u2010value items (especially items 3 and 4).\n\nMy values are:\n\u2022 Item 1: 34 (3 units \u2192 3\u00d734 = 102 total)\n\u2022 Item 2: 62 (5 units \u2192 5\u00d762 = 310)\n\u2022 Item 3: 76 (4 units \u2192 4\u00d776 = 304)\n\u2022 Item 4: 97 (4 units \u2192 4\u00d797 = 388)\n\u2022 Item 5: 39 (5 units \u2192 5\u00d739 = 195)\n\nTo keep my final value above 1140, I can \u201cgive\u201d items to Player 2 whose total value (from my perspective) is at most 159. For instance, if I give all 3 units of item 1 (losing 102 value) and 1 unit of item 5 (losing 39 value) the total value given is 102 + 39 = 141 which is within the 159 margin. In that case, my retained amounts would be:\n\u2022 Item 1: 0 units (from 3)\n\u2022 Item 2: all 5 units\n\u2022 Item 3: all 4 units\n\u2022 Item 4: all 4 units\n\u2022 Item 5: 4 units (since 1 of 5 is given)\n\nMy retained total value calculates as:\n\u2022 Item 1: 0 \u00d7 34 = 0\n\u2022 Item 2: 5 \u00d7 62 = 310\n\u2022 Item 3: 4 \u00d7 76 = 304\n\u2022 Item 4: 4 \u00d7 97 = 388\n\u2022 Item 5: 4 \u00d7 39 = 156\nTotal = 310 + 304 + 388 + 156 = 1158\n\nSince 1158 > 1140, this division exceeds my outside offer value.

                    "response": "Step 1: Assess the current offer.\n\u2022 The current offer gives you: 3 units of item\u202f1 and 1 unit of item\u202f5.\n\u2022 Your value per unit is: item\u202f1 = 94, item\u202f5 = 78. Thus, accepting would yield 3\u00d794 + 1\u00d778 = 282 + 78 = 360.\n\u2022 Your outside offer is 938. Therefore, 360 is much lower than what you can guarantee by walking away.\n\nStep 2: Design a counteroffer.\nYou need a deal that gives you a present\u2010value of at least 938. Since we are in round\u202f1 (no discount yet), your bundle\u2019s raw value should be at least 938.\nThe items available form a total value (if you kept everything) of 1282. This implies that the total \u201cvalue\u201d you could afford to give up is 1282 \u2013 938 = 344 (from your perspective).\n\nStep 3: Allocate items strategically.\nTo maximize your own value, you want to keep high\u2013value items and offer away items that are of low value to you.\n\u2022 Your unit values: item\u202f1 = 94, item\u202f2 = 6, item\u202f3 = 52, item\u202f4 = 93, item\u202f5 = 78.\n\u2022 Item\u202f2\u2019s value (6 per unit) is extremely low; item\u202f3 (52 per unit) is also relatively low.\nThus, a good idea is to \u201cgive\u201d Player 1 all of the low\u2013valued items if possible.\nFor example, consider offering:\n\u2003\u2013 All 5 units of item\u202f2: 5\u00d76 = 30 in value.\n\u2003\u2013 All 4 units of item\u202f3: 4\u00d752 = 208 in value.\nTotal given so far = 30 + 208 = 238, which is well under your maximum \u201callowance\u201d of 344.\nNow, to try to push your own share even higher, you can choose not to give away any of the high\u2013value items (item\u202f1, item\u202f4, item\u202f5). In that case, your bundle would be:\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f1: 3 (kept)\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f2: 0 (since you offered all 5)\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f3: 0 (since you offered all 4)\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f4: 4 (kept)\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f5: 5 (kept)\nCalculating your total value: \n\u2003Item\u202f1: 3\u00d794 = 282\n\u2003Item\u202f4: 4\u00d793 = 372\n\u2003Item\u202f5: 5\u00d778 = 390\nTotal = 282 + 372 + 390 = 1044, which exceeds your outside offer of 938. \n\nStep 4: Finalize the counteroffer.\nTherefore, you propose the counteroffer giving Player 1 [0, 5, 4, 0, 0] (i.e. 0 of item\u202f1, all 5 of item\u202f2, all 4 of item\u202f3, and 0 for items\u202f4 and 5).

Then my allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 4 units (I keep all)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2 units (I keep all)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 5 \u2013 4 = 1 unit (I keep 1 unit)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 3 \u2013 3 = 0 units (I keep none)\n\nMy own deal value is then:\n\u2003\u2013 From item 1: 4\u00d769 = 276 \n\u2003\u2013 From item 3: 2\u00d757 = 114 \n\u2003\u2013 From item 4: 1\u00d729 = 29 \n\u2003\u2013 From item 5: 0\n\u2003Total = 276 + 114 + 29 = 419, which far exceeds my outside offer of 273.\n\nFor Player 2 the offer is:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 4 units; expected value roughly 4\u00d751 \u2248 204 \n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 3 units; expected value roughly 3\u00d751 \u2248 153\n\u2003Total (expected) \u2248 357 \nThis is quite near the midpoint of what one might expect for their reservation value (their outside offer is drawn uniformly up to their maximum, whose average for our items is around 714, giving an average outside offer of about 357). (Of course, Player 2\u2019s true values are unknown, so they might counter\u2010offer\u2014but as initial offer I can be a bit aggressive.)\n\nSince this allocation gives me a much better deal while still \u201cbought\u2010off\u201d Player 2 with an expected value near what they might be looking for, I will offer the following counteroffer (which means I am offering Player 2 [0 units of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 3 of item 5], while keeping the rest):\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 4, 3]}",

Any deal I propose must leave me with a value at least equal to that, or I could simply walk away.\n\n\u2022 I get value (per unit) of: item1: 17, item2: 60, item3: 21, item4: 100, and item5: 58. Thus, as the proposer I want to keep as many units of the items I value highly (especially items 2, 4, and 5) and can offer concessions on items I value lower (items 1 and 3).\n\n\u2022 If I na\u00efvely kept all of items 2, 4, and 5 and gave away all of items 1 and 3, I would get:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 0\u2003 (0\u00d717 = 0)\n\u2003\u2003item2: 4\u2003 (4\u00d760 = 240)\n\u2003\u2003item3: 0\u2003 (0\u00d721 = 0)\n\u2003\u2003item4: 2\u2003 (2\u00d7100 = 200)\n\u2003\u2003item5: 9\u2003 (9\u00d758 = 522)\n\u2003\u2003Total = 240 + 200 + 522 = 962, which is below 981.\n\n\u2022 To get above 981, a minimal concession is needed. For example, if I take one extra unit of item3 for myself, then my allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 0 (i.e. giving away all 6 units),\n\u2003\u2003item2: 4 (keeping all 4),\n\u2003\u2003item3: 1 (keeping 1, giving away the other 3 units),\n\u2003\u2003item4: 2 (keeping both),\n\u2003\u2003item5: 9 (keeping all 9).\n\u2003\u2003Then my value is: 0\u00d717 + 4\u00d760 + 1\u00d721 + 2\u00d7100 + 9\u00d758 = 0 + 240 + 21 + 200 + 522 = 983.\n\u2003\u2003That is just above my outside offer of 981.\n\n\u2022 In terms of our offer format (which represents the number of units given to Player2) the above allocation for me corresponds to giving Player2:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 6\u2003 (all units),\n\u2003\u2003item2: 0\u2003 (none of item2),\n\u2003\u2003item3: 3\u2003 (since total is 4, I keep 1),\n\u2003\u2003item4: 0\u2003 (keep both),\n\u2003\u2003item5: 0\u2003 (keep all 9).\n\u2003\u2003This yields an offer vector: [6, 0, 3, 0, 0].\n\n\u2022 This division leaves me with a value of 983, slightly above my outside option, while potentially giving Player2 some items that \u2013 based on uncertainties in their private values \u2013 may be attractive to them.\n\nThus, my action is: \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 0, 3, 0, 0]}",

That gives you 4 \u00d7 93 = 372.\nNext, add some item 1.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [6, 0, 3, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 0, 4, 1, 9]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 4, 1, 9]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I first note that if I accept the current offer [4,0,4,1,9] then I would get:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 4\u00d717 = 68  \n\u2003\u2003item2: 0\u00d760 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003item3: 4\u00d721 = 84  \n\u2003\u2003item4: 1\u00d7100 = 100  \n\u2003\u2003item5: 9\u00d758 = 522  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 68+84+100+522 = 774  \nBecause we are in round 2 the outcome is discounted by \u03b3^(2\u20131)=0.9, so the effective value is 0.9\u00d7774\u2248696.6. That is far below my outside offer of 981, so I must counter.\n\nIn our negotiation the \u201cdivision\u201d is defined by what I \u201cgive\u201d to Player 2. If I offer P2 a counteroffer [x1,x2,x3,x4,x5], then I keep the remainder of each item:\n\u2003\u2003For item i: I keep (total \u2013 xi)  \nThe totals are: item1\u202f=\u202f6, item2\u202f=\u202f4, item3\u202f=\u202f4, item4\u202f=\u202f2, item5\u202f=\u202f9.\u2003\nThus my raw (undiscounted) value is:\n\u2003\u200317\u00d7(6\u2013x1) + 60\u00d7(4\u2013x2) + 21\u00d7(4\u2013x3) + 100\u00d7(2\u2013x4) + 58\u00d7(9\u2013x5).\nSince my total maximum raw value is 1148, I must secure a deal (after discount) that gives me at least 981. Because the final value is multiplied by 0.9 this means that the raw value of what I keep should be at least 981/0.9 = 1089.\n\nIn the \u201cgreedy\u201d extreme I could try to give the opponent nothing\u2014that is, offer [0,0,0,0,0]. Then I would keep all items; my raw value would be 1148, and after discount I\u2019d get 0.9\u00d71148 = 1033.2, which is above my outside offer. (Of course, such a counteroffer gives P2 nothing, so if they reject the deal I fall back to my outside offer of 981.)\n\nBecause my objective is to maximize my outcome, and I have a safe fallback at 981, I choose to try the aggressive move. If Player 2 accepts, I get 1033.2 in \u201cdiscounted\u2010value\u201d terms (and my outcome is higher than 981). If not, I still receive 981 from my outside offer.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0,0,0,0,0]}",

Obviously, accepting that would get me 0 value, well below my reservation value (472 from my outside option).\n2. In our bargaining protocol, when making a counteroffer, the numbers we specify represent what we give to Player 1. We then keep what remains from the total available items [6,4,4,2,9].\n3. My private per\u2013unit values are: item 1: 44, item 2: 93, item 3: 34, item 4: 42, and item 5: 1. It is in my interest to keep the items that have high value to me (especially items 1,2,3,4) and to offer away items with almost no value (here, item 5).\n4. One extreme counteroffer is to claim nearly everything for myself and offer Player 1 only the items I value the least. If I offer away all units of item 5 (a total of 9) while keeping all units of the higher\u2013value items, I secure for myself:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 6 units (6\u00d744 = 264)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 4 units (4\u00d793 = 372)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 4 units (4\u00d734 = 136)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 2 units (2\u00d742 = 84)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 0 units\n\u2003\u2003Raw total = 264 + 372 + 136 + 84 = 856.\nIn round 2 the discount factor is 0.9, making the present value 856\u00d70.9 \u2248 770.4, which is far above my outside offer of 472.\n5. Although this offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 9] is very favorable to me, it leaves Player 1 with only item 5 (which I value at 1 per unit). Their private valuations are unknown, but it is a common tactic to concede items that you value very little (hoping that the other side might place more worth on them than you do). Despite the risk that Player 1 may reject it, securing a deal that gives me 770+ (discounted) is my primary objective when compared to the worthless current offer.\n6. Given the alternatives (accepting a no\u2013value offer or walking away to receive my outside offer of 472), my best move is to propose the counteroffer that gives me nearly everything important and only hands over the items I care less about.\n\nThus, my chosen action is to counteroffer by giving Player 1 all 9 units of item 5 and keeping everything else.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 9]}",

Meanwhile, although I don\u2019t know Player2\u2019s private values, offering them all of items 4 and 5 (even if I value them low) plus a token share of the higher\u2013value items can be a reasonable starting point to encourage agreement.\n\nThus, my action is to make the following offer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 4, 8]}",

Thus any deal that gives us less than 397 in our \u201cdiscount\u2010free\u201d round (round 1, so no discount) is worse than simply \u201cwalking away.\u201d\n\nStep 2: In our negotiation, we propose an \u201cinitial offer\u201d that specifies how many units of each item we give to the other party (Player\u00a02). (Remember: what we keep is the remainder from the total available for each item.) We want our retained bundle to be worth at least 397 to us. At the same time we must offer Player\u00a02 something that is attractive enough compared to the unknown value of their \u201coutside offer.\u201d\n\nStep 3: Our private per\u2011unit values are:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 18\u2003\u2003(Item total: 2)\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 41\u2003\u2003(Item total: 4)\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 48\u2003\u2003(Item total: 3)\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 11\u2003\u2003(Item total: 4)\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 32\u2003\u2003(Item total: 4)\n\nSince we want to maximize our own retained value while \u201cbuying\u201d acceptance, we wish to give away items that cost us \u201ccheap\u201d value (low value to us) but that might still count as \u201cstuff\u201d for Player\u00a02. On our list the cheapest is item\u00a04 (11 per unit) and then item\u00a01 (18 per unit). This is the \u201ceconomical\u201d way to get as many items (units) into Player\u00a02\u2019s bundle without giving up high\u2010value (to us) items.\n\nStep 4: To have our remaining bundle be worth at least 397 (our value from what we keep), we note that we have 516 in total. Thus the maximum \u201closs\u201d we can afford is 516 \u2013 397 = 119 in our own value. We want to offer enough total units such that\u2014assuming that Player\u00a02 sees an average unit \u201cbenefit\u201d (for many items, the average value is roughly the center of the 1\u2013101 range) they get a sizable bundle. A rough \u201cexpected\u201d value per unit for them is around 51. To be competitive with their unknown outside option we would likely need to provide them a bundle containing roughly 7\u20138 units. But we cannot concede too much \u2013 we must keep our loss (in our own valuation) no more than 119.\n\nStep 5: One \u201ceconomical\u201d combination is to give up:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 All 4 units of item\u00a04 (loss = 4\u00d711 = 44)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Both units of item\u00a01 (loss = 2\u00d718 = 36)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item\u00a05 (loss = 1\u00d732 = 32)\n\nThis totals a loss of 44 + 36 + 32 = 112. Our retained bundle\u2019s value is then 516 \u2013 112 = 404, which is above 397.\n\nStep 6: What does Player\u00a02 receive? They would get:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2 units\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 0 units\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 0 units\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 4 units\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 1 unit\nThat is a total of 2 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 7 units. With an expected per\u2010unit value (from their uniform distribution) of about 51, the \u201cexpected\u201d total is roughly 357. While we cannot know their exact reservation, offering 7 \u201ceconomical\u201d units might entice them in round 1.\n\nStep 7: In summary, this counteroffer \u201cgives\u201d Player\u00a02 the bundle [2, 0, 0, 4, 1]. We retain a bundle valued at 404 for us \u2013 which beats our outside offer \u2013 while providing Player\u00a02 roughly 7 units that could be attractive relative to their outside option. (There is some risk if Player\u00a02\u2019s actual private outside offer or valuation makes our bundle less attractive, but given our information this is a reasonable opening offer.)\n\nFinal Action in the required JSON format:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 4, 1]}",

In order for any negotiated division to improve upon my outside option, I would need to secure a deal in which the bundle I end up with is worth at least 632 by my numbers. In a counteroffer I would be choosing how many units (n\u2081\u2013n\u2085) to give Player\u00a01, leaving me their remainders; my share\u2019s value would be \n\n\u2003\u2003992 \u2013 (n\u2081\u00d757 + n\u2082\u00d725 + n\u2083\u00d770 + n\u2084\u00d744 + n\u2085\u00d798).\n\nTo beat my outside offer I must have \n\u2003\u2003992 \u2013 (sum) \u2265 632\u2003\u27f9\u2003sum \u2264 360.\n\nIdeally I\u2019d like to \u201cconcede\u201d as little in value as possible (i.e. keeping a high share), but I also must give Player\u00a01 enough to entice them to accept. For example, one simple (if aggressive) counteroffer would be to offer them only 3 units of item\u00a05 (the item I value most), i.e. [0,0,0,0,3]. That would leave me with the remaining items [2,4,3,4,1] (since total for item\u00a05 is 4\u20133 = 1) whose value computes to 114 +100 +210 +176 +98 = 698. This is clearly above my 632 guarantee. However, note that from my perspective the previous deal offered to me gave Player\u00a01 a complementary bundle that (by my valuations) was worth 604. By offering them only [0,0,0,0,3] (worth 3\u00d798 = 294 to me), it is very likely too \u201cstingy\u201d for Player\u00a01 to accept.\n\nWithout knowing Player\u00a01\u2019s private values it is very risky to counter with an offer that gives them much less \u201cvalue\u201d than the division they themselves just proposed (which from my viewpoint made them look like they\u2019d get near 604 in value). Given the substantial risk that an aggressive counteroffer would be rejected\u2014and given that I have a guaranteed outside option for 632\u2014it is safest and most rational for me to WALK away at this point.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Here\u2019s my line of thought:\n\n1. The total available items are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 2 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 7 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 3 units\n\n2. My private values per unit are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 33\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 36\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 88\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 51\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 55\nIf I got every item, my total value would be 924. (My outside option is 420, so any negotiated deal must give me more than 420 in \u201craw\u201d value even before considering the discount factor. In round\u202f1 the discount is \u03b3^(0)=1.)\n\n3. In a bargaining situation I want to maximize my outcome. I would like to keep the high\u2010value items for myself. For me the most valuable item is item\u202f3 (value 88 per unit), and items\u202f4 and 5 also contribute strongly. The items that are lower (33 and 36 per unit) are ones where I am willing to \u201cgive up\u201d the full quantity to entice Player\u202f2 to accept the deal.\n\n4. I consider giving Player\u202f2 all of items 1 and 2 (i.e. [2, 2, \u2026]) because that gives up only a combined \u201closs\u201d of 2\u00d733 + 2\u00d736 = 66 + 72 = 138 to me while still offering them nonzero quantity. However, if I offer nothing else, Player\u202f2 may think, \u201cPerhaps I can reach an even better deal in later rounds (or get more of the items I value even if my private values are different)\u201d. To make the offer more attractive in this first round\u2014and since a delayed deal incurs a discount at \u03b3 = 0.9\u2014I want to sweeten the deal by giving them a little bit from item\u202f4 (which, at 51 per unit for me, is less valuable than items\u202f3 or 5).\n\n5. If I give Player\u202f2 an extra 2 units of item\u202f4, then my allocation would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f2\u2019s offer: item 1 = 2, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 0, item 4 = 2, item 5 = 0.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 I keep: item 3 = 3, item 4 = 7\u20132 = 5, item 5 = 3.\nLet\u2019s check my total value:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 5 \u00d7 51 = 255\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 3 \u00d7 55 = 165\n\u2003\u2003Total = 264 + 255 + 165 = 684,\nwhich is well above my outside offer of 420. This leaves me with a very good outcome while, hopefully, giving Player\u202f2 enough \u201cincentive\u201d to accept in round\u202f1 rather than risk waiting and losing some value from discounting or receiving an outside offer that may be lower than what this deal can eventually yield.\n\nThus, my initial counteroffer is to offer Player\u202f2: 2 units of item\u202f1, 2 units of item\u202f2, 0 units of item\u202f3, 2 units of item\u202f4, and 0 units of item\u202f5.\n\nI now provide the action in the required JSON format.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]}",

My reservation (outside offer) is worth 414, so accepting 340 is worse than my guaranteed alternative. \n\nThus, I want to propose a counteroffer. In our negotiation protocol, a counteroffer is given by stating how many units I \u201cgive\u201d to Player\u00a01; then I receive the remainder. My goal is to \u201ckeep\u201d a bundle that scores for me at least 414. My total value if I got everything would be 685, so if I give Player\u00a01 an offer x (a vector with components x1,\u2026,x5), then my value is\n\n\u2003\u2003685 \u2013 (x1\u00d762 + x2\u00d790 + x3\u00d78 + x4\u00d718 + x5\u00d777).\n\nFor me to do better than 414 we need:\n\u2003\u2003685 \u2013 (concession value) \u2265 414\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003\u2003concession value \u2264 271.\n\nOf course I also want to \u201cimprove\u201d on the current offer (which gives me 340) but not give away so much that the other party is far worse off than what they already expect. Note that under the current offer, Player\u00a01 would end up with the leftovers:\n\u2022\u2003Item 1: 2\u20132 = 0  \n\u2022\u2003Item 2: 2\u20132 = 0  \n\u2022\u2003Item 3: 3\u20130 = 3  \n\u2022\u2003Item 4: 7\u20132 = 5  \n\u2022\u2003Item 5: 3\u20130 = 3  \nso they would get [0, 0, 3, 5, 3].\n\nBecause my high\u2013value items are item 1 (62), item 2 (90) and item 5 (77) I prefer to keep those. Meanwhile, item 3 (value 8) and item 4 (value 18) are comparatively \u201ccheap\u201d for me. Thus a natural idea is to let them have all of item 3 (all 3 units) and nearly all of item 4 (so they don\u2019t lose too much compared to their current bundle) while I keep everything of item 1, item 2, and most of item 5.\n\nFor example, consider if I give Player\u00a01 the bundle:\n\u2003\u2003[0, 0, 3, 5, 1]\nThis means:\n\u2022\u2003For item 1: I give 0 \u2192 I keep 2 units.\n\u2022\u2003For item 2: I give 0 \u2192 I keep 2 units.\n\u2022\u2003For item 3: I give 3 \u2192 I keep 0 units.\n\u2022\u2003For item 4: I give 5 \u2192 I keep 7\u20135 = 2 units.\n\u2022\u2003For item 5: I give 1 \u2192 I keep 3\u20131 = 2 units.\n\nThen my total value is:\n\u2022\u2003Item 1: 2 \u00d7 62 = 124  \n\u2022\u2003Item 2: 2 \u00d7 90 = 180  \n\u2022\u2003Item 3: 0 \u00d7 8 = 0  \n\u2022\u2003Item 4: 2 \u00d7 18 = 36  \n\u2022\u2003Item 5: 2 \u00d7 77 = 154  \nTotal = 124 + 180 + 36 + 154 = 494, which is well above my reservation (414).\n\nPlayer\u00a01, compared to their current allotment of [0, 0, 3, 5, 3], now gets [0, 0, 3, 5, 1] \u2013 so they receive exactly what they had for items 3 and 4, and only slightly less on item 5. Given that I value item\u00a05 highly, I suspect Player\u00a01\u2019s private values for that item will be lower on average. This counteroffer improves my position significantly over 414 while not \u201cstarving\u201d Player\u00a01 too much relative to their expected alternative.\n\nThus, my action is to propose the counteroffer:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 5, 1]}",

In this game my total value for all items is 848, and my private outside offer guarantees me 678. That means that any division I accept must yield me at least 678 in my own \u201cvalue\u2010score\u201d (using my private per\u2010unit values). In other words, I cannot concede more than 848 \u2013 678 = 170 (in my valuation) to Player\u00a02 if I want the deal to be at least as good as my outside offer.\n\nBecause my items are \u201cpriced\u201d (to me) as follows:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01: 76 per unit\u2003\u2003(total available: 3)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a02: 50 per unit\u2003\u2003(total available: 4)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03: 62 per unit\u2003\u2003(total available: 4)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04: 32 per unit\u2003\u2003(total available: 2)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05: 27 per unit\u2003\u2003(total available: 4)\n\nmy best way to \u201csave\u201d on value is to give away only the items that are \u201ccheap\u201d for me (namely, items\u00a04 and 5). In the ideal case I\u2019d like to concede as close as possible to 170 in value. For example, if I gave away all of item\u00a05 (4 \u00d7 27 = 108) and also all of item\u00a04 (2 \u00d7 32 = 64) that would add up to 172 \u2013 a bit too high (848 \u2013 172 = 676, which is 2 below my guarantee). Working with the available discrete units I can\u2019t come up with any split that gives me at least 678 while giving Player\u00a02 an \u201cattractive\u201d package. In fact, any deal that gives me the minimum acceptable 678 means I\u2019m offering Player\u00a02 no more than roughly 170 in my value scores. (In a \u201cfair\u2010splitting\u201d world, Player\u00a02\u2019s own outside offer would often be around half of their full value \u2013 roughly 433 on average \u2013 which is far larger than about 170 if we assume they value items roughly around 50 per unit.) \n\nThus, if I try to \u201cclaim\u201d my outside option by insisting on a deal that gives me at least 678, the best I could do is to keep almost all of the high\u2010value items (leaving myself, say, a package worth 703) while conceding only a handful of the \u201clow\u2010value\u201d items (maybe items 4 and 5 giving Player\u00a02 about 140 in my measure). This would mean Player\u00a02 ends up with roughly 5 low\u2010priced units \u2013 a package that in expectation (around 5 \u00d7 51 = 255, if one uses their average value of 51 per unit) is far below what they might expect from their own outside offer.\n\nSince I do have a safe alternative (678 for sure) and it appears impossible to craft an offer that gives Player\u00a02 enough (in expected terms) to be better off than their likely outside option while still guaranteeing me at least 678, I must conclude that any deal reached in round\u00a01 would likely fail to entice Player\u00a02 to agree. In that situation my best \u201csafety net\u201d is my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, to guarantee at least 678 (and to avoid a potentially drawn\u2010out negotiation in which discounting would harm me), my best action in round\u00a01 is to WALK away from negotiations and take my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

For example, if I offer player 2 three units of item 1 (worth 3\u00d743 = 129 to me), one unit of item 2 (30), and one unit of item 3 (29), then the total \u201ccost\u201d (in my valuation) is 129 + 30 + 29 = 188 which is well below 263. My remaining bundle would be:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 6 \u2013 3 = 3 units \u2192 3\u00d743 = 129\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units \u2192 2\u00d730 = 60\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 4 \u2013 1 = 3 units \u2192 3\u00d729 = 87\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: all 3 units \u2192 183\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: all 4 units \u2192 256\nTotal = 129 + 60 + 87 + 183 + 256 = 715, which is above my outside offer of 640.\n\nAt the same time player 2 gets a bundle (from my perspective) valued at 188 (but for them the items may be worth more given their own private values drawn from 1 to 101). This seems like a promising and aggressive first offer that lets me safely exceed my alternative while offering the other side something that might induce them to negotiate rather than walk away.\n\nThus, my chosen action is to offer player 2 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, and nothing from items 4 or 5.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 0, 0]}",

In negotiations, a common tactic is to \u201cpinch\u2010hit\u201d on items that have high private value by keeping as many of those as possible and offering the opponent items that matter relatively less to me.\n4.

Though this is quite aggressive for Player 2 (as they do not receive any of the items that are highly valuable to me), since it is the first move and there is no prior offer on the table, I am maximizing my own value.

(This follows the example given where an offer to the other player \u201cleaves you with\u201d the remaining quantities.)\n\u2022 The current offer is [4, 3, 0, 0, 0].

Therefore, to earn more than my outside offer, I need to secure at least 502 using the negotiated split. In other words, I must secure at least 502 in my personal valuation while giving the other player just enough to make it worthwhile for them.\n2. Since I propose the split as Player\u00a01, I have the power to allocate only a small \u201cconcession\u201d to Player\u00a02 if I expect that the other player\u2019s private values might favor the items I offer them. My aim is to \u201cspare\u201d as much value (by my valuation) as possible.\n3. To remain above 502 for myself, I can only give up at most 534 \u2212 502 = 32 of my own value. \n4. Looking at my private values:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For item 2: 42 per unit \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For item 3: 26 per unit \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For item 4: 81 per unit \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For item 5: 8 per unit\n\u2003The cheapest item for me is item 5 (value 8 per unit). There are 2 units of item 5 available.\n5. By offering all 2 units of item 5 to Player\u00a02, I \u201cspend\u201d 2 \u00d7 8 = 16 value from my perspective. I would then keep all of the other items: 0 of item 1 (none available), 6 of item 2, 4 of item 3, and 2 of item 4. That gives me a total value of:\n\u2003\u20036\u00d742 + 4\u00d726 + 2\u00d781 = 252 + 104 + 162 = 518.\nThis is above my outside offer of 502.\n6. This counteroffer minimizes my concession (only 16 value given away in my valuation) and still guarantees me a value of 518 if accepted. While I do not know Player\u00a02's private values, offering the items that are least valuable for me (item 5) is a common negotiating tactic.\n7.

                    "response": "I'll first explain my thinking briefly:\n\n1. Under the current offer (getting [0,0,0,0,2]), I\u2019d receive only 2 units of item\u00a05. With my private value of 56 per unit for item\u00a05, that yields a value of 2\u00d756 = 112, which is below my outside offer value of 115. So accepting right away isn\u2019t attractive.\n\n2. My goal is to secure a deal giving me a present (undiscounted, round\u20111) value above 115 while still making the offer acceptable to Player\u00a01. In our setting the total items available are: item\u00a01:0, item\u00a02:6, item\u00a03:4, item\u00a04:2, and item\u00a05:2. In a counteroffer I choose to indicate how much I give to Player\u00a01; I keep what\u2019s left.\n\n3. Since I value almost all of the items very highly (for example, item\u00a02 is worth 55 for me, item\u00a04 is worth 51, and item\u00a05 is worth 56), I want to allocate nearly everything to myself. Yet I must give a small concession so Player\u00a01 might be willing to agree rather than risk a delay (which would discount payoffs).\n\n4. A very aggressive proposal is to give only 1 unit of one item to Player\u00a01. I select item\u00a05 (which is scarce and highly valued by me), offering them 1 unit. With this counteroffer, my allocation becomes: \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item\u00a01: 0 (total 0),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item\u00a02: 6,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item\u00a03: 4,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item\u00a04: 2,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item\u00a05: 2 \u2013 1 = 1.\n\u2003My own full value is 0\u00d771 + 6\u00d755 + 4\u00d710 + 2\u00d751 + 1\u00d756 = 0 + 330 + 40 + 102 + 56 = 528, well above 115. \n\n5. Although this is a very tough stance (leaving Player\u00a01 only 1 unit of item\u00a05), it is a counteroffer that maximizes my outcome compared to my outside offer and is a plausible starting point in negotiations given I don\u2019t know Player\u00a01\u2019s private values.\n\nBased on this reasoning, my action is to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

Our private value for item 5 is 8, so we get 1 \u00d7 8 = 8.\n  \nStep 2: Adjust for discounting. Since we are in round 2 (r = 2) and gamma = 0.9, the discounted value would be 8 \u00d7 0.9 = 7.2.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "I want to be sure that any deal I agree to gives me an outcome that exceeds my guaranteed outside\u2010offer value of 434. The current offer would net me only 0\u00d749 + 2\u00d717 + 1\u00d779 + 0\u00d724 + 0\u00d768 = 0 + 34 + 79 + 0 + 0 = 113, which is far below 434. (Recall that since we are in round\u00a01 the discount factor is 1, so no time discount applies.) \n\nSince I control the counteroffer now, I can decide how much of each item I leave for Player\u00a01\u2014remember, when I \u201ccounteroffer\u201d I specify the number of units given to them and keep whatever remains. The available totals are:  \n\u2022\u2003Item 1: 1 unit  \n\u2022\u2003Item 2: 2 units  \n\u2022\u2003Item 3: 6 units  \n\u2022\u2003Item 4: 4 units  \n\u2022\u2003Item 5: 2 units  \n\nMy own values are:  \n\u2022\u2003Item 1: 49  \n\u2022\u2003Item 2: 17  \n\u2022\u2003Item 3: 79  \n\u2022\u2003Item 4: 24  \n\u2022\u2003Item 5: 68  \n\nIf I were to take almost everything for myself, I risk that Player\u00a01 will reject the deal in favor of their outside offer. (Their outside offer is unknown to me, but on average\u2014given that their unit values are drawn from Uniform(1,101)\u2014their total \u201cmax\u2010value\u201d is around 765 and their outside offer would be drawn between 1 and that maximum; for many draws the offered value would be in the 300\u2013400 range.) \n\nSo I want to \u201csweeten\u201d the deal enough for Player\u00a01 by giving them a reasonable share while still keeping my own total value well above 434. One natural idea is to \u201cslice\u201d the available items so that I take most of the high\u2010value ones (to me) but concede some numbers (especially on items I care less about) to Player\u00a01. For example, if I keep nearly everything but give them all of item\u00a01 and item\u00a02 and most of item\u00a04, then my residual share is: \n\n\u2003\u2003My share = Total \u2013 Offer  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 1: 1 \u2013 1 = 0 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 2: 2 \u2013 2 = 0 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 3: 6 \u2013 2 = 4 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 4: 4 \u2013 3 = 1 unit  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2 \u2013 0 = 2 units  \n\nMy total value from that would be:  \n\u2003\u20030\u00d749 + 0\u00d717 + 4\u00d779 + 1\u00d724 + 2\u00d768  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0 + 0 + 316 + 24 + 136  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 476  \n\nThis is safely above my outside offer (476 > 434).  \n\nNow, what about Player\u00a01\u2019s side? Under this counteroffer Player\u00a01 would receive:  \n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 1 unit  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 2 units  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 2 units  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 3 units  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 0 units  \n\nEven though I don\u2019t know their exact private values, if we assume (on average) they value a unit at about 51 (the midpoint of 1 to 101) then their approximate total \u201cvalue\u201d from these items would be roughly:  \n\u2003\u20031\u00d751 + 2\u00d751 + 2\u00d751 + 3\u00d751 \u2248 51 + 102 + 102 + 153 = 408.  \n\nThis amount seems plausible as a deal that could be at least as attractive as their outside offer (which is uncertain but likely in a similar range given the distribution). (Of course, if Player\u00a01\u2019s draw was unusually high their outside offer could be higher\u2014but I hope that the risk of a discount in later rounds gives them incentive to accept a \u201cnow\u201d deal with no discount.)\n\nFor these reasons I find the counteroffer of giving Player\u00a01 [1, 2, 2, 3, 0] (and keeping [0, 0, 4, 1, 2] for myself) acceptable. It delivers me a value of 476\u2014comfortably beating my outside option\u2014and should be attractive enough for Player\u00a01.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 3, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I note that among the five items I highly prize items 2 (46 per unit) and 5 (50 per unit), and less so items 3 (3 per unit) and 4 (8 per unit). In order to make an offer that gives Player 2 an attractive deal while keeping nearly all high\u2010value items for myself, a natural idea is to give them all the units of the items I care relatively little about.\n\nThere are 6 units of item 3 and 7 units of item 4. If I propose to give those to Player 2 and keep all of item 1 (4 units), item 2 (4 units), and item 5 (4 units) for myself then my share yields a value of:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 4\u00d720 = 80 \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 4\u00d746 = 184 \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 0\u00d73 = 0 \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 0\u00d78 = 0 \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 4\u00d750 = 200 \nTotal = 80 + 184 + 0 + 0 + 200 = 464\u2003\u2003(\u226b154)\n\nThis aggressive division leaves Player 2 with 13 units (all of items 3 and 4). It is a high\u2010claim offer for me, and I expect if Player 2\u2019s private values on items 3 and 4 are reasonably favorable they might accept so as not to risk delay (which would incur a discount) or falling back on their outside option.\n\nTherefore, my proposal as Player 1 is to give Player 2:\n\u2003Offer: [0, 0, 6, 7, 0]\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 6, 7, 0]}",

My private outside offer guarantees me a value of 1068. Therefore, any deal I agree to must give me at least 1068 in value.\n3. In order to get more than 1068 from the deal, the most I can give up (in terms of my own valuation) is 1085 \u2013 1068 = 17.\n4. Looking at my value per unit for each item, the least valuable item (to me) is item 2 worth 27 per unit. Even conceding 1 unit of any available type would cost me at least 27, which would drop my share below 1068. \n5. Therefore, to ensure my share exceeds the outside offer, I cannot afford to give away any units.\n6. Accordingly, my best initial offer is to propose all items for myself, that is, offer Player 2 0 units of every item.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0,0,0,0,0]}",

                    "response": "My reasoning:\n1. The current offer gives us nothing (the offer is [0,0,0,0,0]), which would yield a value of 0 for us. Our outside offer is 982, so accepting would be worse.\n2. In a counteroffer we must propose an allocation of the total items. The total available items are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 9 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 2 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 6 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 0 units\nWhen we make a counteroffer \u201coffer\u201d: [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5] to Player 1, that means we \u201cgive\u201d those amounts to them and keep the remainders:\n\u2003\u2022 For item 1 we keep 9 \u2013 n1, for item 2 we keep 2 \u2013 n2, etc.\n3. Our private per-unit values are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 97\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 89\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 35\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 33\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 71 (but there are 0 units available)\nThus our value if we keep (9 \u2013 n1, 2 \u2013 n2, 2 \u2013 n3, 6 \u2013 n4, 0) is:\n\u200397\u00d7(9\u2013n1) + 89\u00d7(2\u2013n2) + 35\u00d7(2\u2013n3) + 33\u00d7(6\u2013n4).\n4. At an outcome in round 1, no discount applies (\u03b3^(1-1)=1). To justify entering an agreement we need our allocation\u2019s value to be at least 982 (our outside offer).\n5. To maximize our outcome, we want to keep as much as possible. However, if we give Player 1 nothing, they are likely to reject (because they receive nothing and will then use their outside offer). So we must concede a (hopefully minimal) amount.\n6. A natural minimal concession is to offer Player 1 a small amount. For example, if we offer them 1 unit of item 1 (i.e. set offer = [1,0,0,0,0]) then we keep:\n\u2003Item 1: 9\u20131 = 8 units, which gives us 8\u00d797 = 776.\n\u2003Item 2: 2\u20130 = 2 units, value = 2\u00d789 = 178.\n\u2003Item 3: 2\u20130 = 2 units, value = 70.\n\u2003Item 4: 6\u20130 = 6 units, value = 6\u00d733 = 198.\n\u2003Total value = 776 + 178 + 70 + 198 = 1222,\nwhich is well above our safe alternative of 982.\n7. This minimal concession has a chance of enticing Player 1 (who may have a relatively moderate outside offer), while ensuring that we get a significantly high value.\n\nThus, my move is to make a counteroffer giving Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}",

This means that if we end up with a deal, we must ensure our share is worth at least 764; equivalently, the \u201cvalue\u201d of the items we give to Player 2 (as measured by our own per\u2010unit values) must be no more than (844 \u2013 764) = 80 points. In any counteroffer, if we offer Player 2 x\u2081, x\u2082, \u2026, x\u2085 units (with the supply limits of [3, 4, 3, 5, 2]), our retained value will equal\n\n\u2003\u2003844 \u2013 [81\u00b7(offer for item1) + 21\u00b7(offer for item2) + 28\u00b7(offer for item3) + 51\u00b7(offer for item4) + 89\u00b7(offer for item5)].\n\nTo guarantee our deal is better than our outside offer, we need:\n\u2003\u2003sum = 81\u00b7n\u2081 + 21\u00b7n\u2082 + 28\u00b7n\u2083 + 51\u00b7n\u2084 + 89\u00b7n\u2085 \u2264 80.\n\nSince even 1 unit of item 1 (worth 81) or item 5 (worth 89) would exceed that budget, we must offer 0 units of items 1 and 5. This leaves items 2, 3, and 4.\n\u2013 For item 2, each unit \u201ccosts\u201d us 21 points; maximum possible units is 3 (since 4 would be 84 points).\n\u2013 For item 3, each unit is 28; maximum 2 units (since 3 units would be 84).\n\u2013 For item 4, each unit is 51; so at most 1 unit (since 2 units is 102).\nAny combination must satisfy 21\u00b7n\u2082 + 28\u00b7n\u2083 + 51\u00b7n\u2084 \u2264 80.\n\nWe want to \u201cgive\u201d Player 2 just enough so that our own share (844 minus that value) is slightly above our outside offer, thus preserving our improvement margin. For example, one possibility is to offer:\n\u2003\u2003n\u2082 = 2 units of item 2 (2 \u00d7 21 = 42),\n\u2003\u2003n\u2083 = 1 unit of item 3 (1 \u00d7 28 = 28),\n\u2003\u2003n\u2084 = 0 units of item 4,\nwith items 1 and 5 forced to 0.\nThe total \u201ccost\u201d to us is 42 + 28 = 70, so we keep a value of 844 \u2013 70 = 774, which beats our outside offer of 764.

I also know my own per\u2010unit values, so I can \u201csacrifice\u201d items that are relatively less valuable to me to enhance Player 1\u2019s side. My ranking (from highest to lowest importance) is: item 1 (26), item 3 (25), then item 2 (22), item 4 (21), and finally item 5 (10). \n\nA natural \u201cfair split\u201d is to split each item nearly equally \u2013 especially when I lack direct knowledge of Player 1\u2019s private values. For example, consider splitting each item as evenly as possible:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1 (total 3): give Player 1 1 unit, I keep 2.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2 (total 4): split 2 and 2.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3 (total 3): give Player 1 1 unit, I keep 2.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4 (total 5): split as 2 for Player 1 and 3 for me.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5 (total 2): split as 1 and 1.\nUnder this division my bundle is [2, 2, 2, 3, 1]. In value that is:\n\u2003Item 1: 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n\u2003Item 2: 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n\u2003Item 3: 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n\u2003Item 4: 3 \u00d7 21 = 63\n\u2003Item 5: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\nTotal = 52 + 44 + 50 + 63 + 10 = 219\u2003\u2003(>124, and a very good outcome compared to my reservation)\nPlayer 1 would then receive [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]. Even though I am \u201cclaiming\u201d more of the high\u2013value (to me) items, I compensate Player 1 by giving him the other half of the items. This offer is balanced enough that Player 1 might consider it better than his own uncertain outside offer\u2014but it gives me a high payoff.\n\nThus, my counteroffer is to give Player 1 the bundle [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]}",

                    "response": "I want to propose a deal that, if accepted, gives me a discounted \u201cshare\u201d above my safe outside value of 669 and \u201cleaves\u201d the opponent enough items so that they\u2019re likely to prefer a deal over their outside offer. (Recall that if we get no deal, I receive 669 for sure.)\n\nHere is my reasoning:\n\n1. The total value I would get if I kept everything is \n\u2003\u20032\u00d745 + 6\u00d716 + 5\u00d766 + 3\u00d773 + 4\u00d746 = 919.\nMy safe alternative is 669, so I must \u201cpay\u201d no more than a concession of 919 \u2013 669 = 250 (in my own \u201ccost units\u201d) if a deal is reached.\n\n2. My \u201ccost per unit\u201d (my private value) is lowest for item 2 (16 per unit), then item 1 (45 per unit) and item 5 (46 per unit) before the high\u2010value items (items 3 and 4). To \u201cspend\u201d my concession budget in the \u201ccheapest\u201d possible way (so that I give the opponent items that I personally value less but that may be attractive for them), I want first to give all 6 units of item 2. That costs 6\u00d716 = 96 from my perspective.\n\n3. Then, among the remaining items, item 1 costs me 45 per unit. I have 2 available so by offering 2 units I incur an extra cost of 2\u00d745 = 90. Thus far my concession is 96 + 90 = 186.\n\n4. I still have room from my \u201cbudget\u201d of 250; I can \u201cspend\u201d up to an additional 64 (i.e. 250 \u2013 186). The next best candidate is item 5 (46 per unit). Offering 1 unit gives a cost of 46. Then total concession = 186 + 46 = 232, below the 250 limit. (I cannot add another full unit from any type without exceeding the limit.)\n\n5. With that offer the division is as follows:\n\u2003\u2003Offer to opponent: 2 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n\u2003\u2003My kept amounts are then: 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, all 5 of item 3, all 3 of item 4, and the remaining 3 of item 5.\n\u2003\u2003My value for what I keep is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003item 3: 5\u00d766 = 330,\n\u2003\u2003\u2003item 4: 3\u00d773 = 219,\n\u2003\u2003\u2003item 5: 3\u00d746 = 138.\n\u2003\u2003Summing up: 330 + 219 + 138 = 687, which is above 669.\n\u2003\u2003My \u201closs\u201d (the sum in my own \u201ccurrency\u201d that I give away) is 232, well within the 250 allowance.\n\n6. Although I do not know the opponent\u2019s private values, by giving them not only all of the lower\u2011valued item 2 but also some of item 1 and a unit of item 5 I hope the bundle is attractive enough (likely around 9 items total) to overcome their outside option (which\u2014given that their full total sum is around 1020\u2014might on average be around 510). At the same time, I retain a reasonably high payoff for myself.\n\nThus, my initial offer is to give Player 2: [2, 6, 0, 0, 1]. \n\nMy action is then:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2,6,0,0,1]}",

Matching that request in my counteroffer gives:\n\u2003\u2003Deduction = 16 (for item\u202f2) + 73 (for item\u202f4) = 89\nThen my share is:\n\u2003\u2003Item\u202f1: 2 \u2013 0 = 2 units\n\u2003\u2003Item\u202f2: 6 \u2013 1 = 5 units \n\u2003\u2003Item\u202f3: 5 \u2013 0 = 5 units\n\u2003\u2003Item\u202f4: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units\n\u2003\u2003Item\u202f5: 4 \u2013 0 = 4 units\nMy undiscounted total value becomes 919 \u2013 89 = 830 \nand discounted value in round 2 is 0.9\u00d7830 = 747, which is comfortably above 669.\n\nThus, to secure a good outcome compared to my outside offer, I will counteroffer by giving Player\u202f2 [0,1,0,1,0]. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}",

With that, my allocation becomes:\n\u2003item 1: 5 \u2013 3 = 2 units\n\u2003item 2: 3 \u2013 2 = 1 unit\n\u2003item 3: 2 \u2013 1 = 1 unit\n\u2003item 4: 6 \u2013 3 = 3 units\n\u2003item 5: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units\n\nNow my value would be:\n\u2003item 1: 2 \u00d7 54 = 108 \n\u2003item 2: 1 \u00d7 71 = 71 \n\u2003item 3: 1 \u00d7 41 = 41 \n\u2003item 4: 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 \n\u2003item 5: 2 \u00d7 80 = 160 \nTotal = 108 + 71 + 41 + 156 + 160 = 536\n\n536 > 473, so this counteroffer gives me a better outcome. In the counteroffer I must specify what I\u2019m offering player 1. That means I offer player 1 the following quantities per item:\n\u2003item 1: 3,\u2003item 2: 2,\u2003item 3: 1,\u2003item 4: 3,\u2003item 5: 1\n\nThus, my counteroffer is: {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3,2,1,3,1]}",

                    "response": "I want to propose a division that \u201csells\u201d the less\u2010valued items to Player 2 so that I keep the ones I value highly and yet give Player 2 an offer that (based on typical expectations of their private values) is at least as good as waiting (especially since any future deal will be discounted by \u03b3 = 0.9). My own values are:\n\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 22\u2003\u2003(2 units total)\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 17\u2003\u2003(1 unit total)\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 65\u2003\u2003(3 units total)\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 97\u2003\u2003(4 units total)\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 25\u2003\u2003(2 units total)\n\nIn total the items are worth 694 to me, but I have a \u201csafe\u201d outside offer of 198. (Thus, any deal I get must eventually give me more than 198 in value, when not discounted.)\n\nPlayer 2\u2019s private value per unit is unknown but is drawn uniformly from 1 to 101; roughly the expected per\u2013unit value is about 51. (For example, the 2 units of item 1 have an \u201cexpected\u201d total of approximately 2 \u00d7 51 = 102 for them.) One may expect that if Player 2 waits, then even if their outside offer is in the range of 1 to their total (roughly 612 expected), the discount in future rounds (factor 0.9 per round after round 1) would push them to accept an immediate deal if they get about what would be ~0.9\u00d7[their \u201creservation\u201d value]. Estimating roughly, if their expected whole\u2013item value is around 612 they might get an outside offer on the order of 300\u2013310 in many cases; discounting that by 0.9 gives roughly 275\u2013280. (This is only a rough guide because their true private numbers are hidden.)\n\nI want to \u201cpay\u201d as little as possible from my highly valuable items. My ranking (by my value) is:\n\u2003\u2003Cheapest for me: Item 2 (17), then Item 1 (22) and Item 5 (25), then Item 3 (65) and worst: Item 4 (97).\n\nThus, I consider giving all of Item 1 (2 units) and Item 2 (1 unit) to Player 2; that yields an expected \u201cmarket\u201d value for them of about:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2\u00d751 = 102\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 1\u00d751 = 51\n\u2003\u2003Total so far: 153.\nThis is likely too low compared to their risk\u2013adjusted alternatives.\n\nI can also give them Item 5 (2 units) since its value on my side is low (2\u00d725 = 50) while for them (expected) it gives 2\u00d751 = 102. Thus if I offer full quantities of Item 1, Item 2, and Item 5, that gives Player 2 an expected value of about 102 + 51 + 102 = 255. That is still a bit lower than our rough threshold (~275). To \u201ctop\u201d that threshold, I can sacrifice one unit of Item 3 (costing me 65 per unit) to add another approximate 51 to Player 2\u2019s expected value. Adding that extra unit to Player 2 increases their expected share to \u2248306, which should make it competitive relative to a future discounted deal.\n\nUnder that proposal, Player 2 would get:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2 (all)\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 1 (all)\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 1 (out of 3)\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 0 (I keep all 4)\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2 (all)\n\nThen I keep:\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: remaining 2 units\u2003\u2003\u2192 2\u00d765 = 130\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: all 4 units\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192 4\u00d797 = 388\n\u2003\u2003Total value = 518 (well above my outside offer of 198).\n\nThis division gives me a high value while giving Player 2 an offer that (if their expected per\u2013unit values are around 51) translates to:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 102\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 51\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 51\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 102\n\u2003\u2003Total \u2248 306,\nwhich would likely compare favorably (even after discounting to 0.9\u00d7306 \u2248 275) to waiting.\n\nThus, my action in Round 1 is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 0, 2]}",

In doing so I concede all of the items whose value to me is lower. One natural counteroffer is then to offer Player 2 everything from items 1, 3, and 5 while I keep all of items 2 and 4. \n\nLet\u2019s check this allocation:\n\u2003\u2022 Total items are: item 1:2, item 2:3, item 3:6, item 4:6, item 5:3.\n\u2003\u2022 I propose to give Player 2 all of items 1, 3, and 5. That is, offer = [2, 0, 6, 0, 3]\n\u2003\u2022 Then my allocated bundle is the remainder: [0, 3, 0, 6, 0]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 My value from that would be:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 2: 3 \u00d7 99 = 297  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 4: 6 \u00d7 93 = 558  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Total = 855 undiscouted, which score discounted in round 2 becomes 0.9 \u00d7 855 = 769.5, far above 307.\n\nHowever, if I offered Player 2 [2, 0, 6, 0, 3] they would get 2 + 6 + 3 = 11 units, whereas from the current offer they\u2019d get 12 units ([0, 3, 0, 6, 3]). In expectation (given that Player 2\u2019s valuations are drawn uniformly) the current bundle might be better for them. Thus, to entice Player 2 to accept my counteroffer we need to make it a bit more attractive by giving them at least a similar number or quality of items.\n\nTo that end, I can \u201cadjust\u201d by giving up a tiny bit of one of my high\u2010value items so that Player 2\u2019s bundle is as appealing (or even more so) than the current one. One possibility is:\n\u2003\u2022 Give Player 2 nearly everything from items 1, 3, and 5 AND additionally one unit of item 2 (which I value highly but conceding a small amount might tip the scales). \nThis means I offer Player 2:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 0 units (I keep both, since I don\u2019t want to lose them unnecessarily),\n\u2003\u2003Item 2:  ? \nBut note: in the current counteroffer format I specify the quantities given to Player 2. \n\nI decide on the following division:\n\u2003\u2022 I offer Player 2: [0, 2, 6, 3, 3]\nThen my allocation becomes the remainder:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2 \u2013 0 = 2  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 3 \u2013 2 = 1  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 6 \u2013 6 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 6 \u2013 3 = 3  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 3 \u2013 3 = 0\nMy resulting undiscounted value is:\n\u2003Item 1: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84  \n\u2003Item 2: 1 \u00d7 99 = 99  \n\u2003Item 4: 3 \u00d7 93 = 279  \n\u2003Sum = 84 + 99 + 279 = 462  \nDiscounted to round 2: 0.9 \u00d7 462 = 415.8, which is comfortably above my outside offer (307).\n\nPlayer 2, in this counteroffer, would receive:\n\u2003Item 2: 2 units, item 3: 6 units, item 4: 3 units, item 5: 3 units; a total of 2+6+3+3 = 14 units.\nIn the current history Player 2 could expect the bundle [0,3,0,6,3] (12 units total). Even though the compositions differ, in expectation (with their uniform random values) this new bundle providing a few extra units should be at least as attractive as what they already had\u2014potentially more so.\n\nBecause this counteroffer gives me a significantly higher payoff (415.8 vs 205.2 if I accept) and gives Player 2 an allocation that in expectation is competitive, I will submit it.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0,2,6,3,3]}",

                    "response": "I want to try to \u201canchor\u201d the negotiation by keeping all of the highest\u2010value items (from my perspective) while offering the items I value the least (item 2 and item 4). Here is how I reason:\n\n\u2022 The available items are:\n\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 2 units (value 61 each)\n\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 4 units (value 46 each)\n\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 2 units (value 77 each)\n\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 1 unit (value 50 each)\n\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 4 units (value 93 each)\n\n\u2022 My total value for all items would be 882 if I got everything. However, my outside option is 126. Any accepted deal must give me a value above 126.\n\n\u2022 Since item 5 (93 per unit) and item 3 (77 per unit) are my most valuable and item 1 (61 per unit) is also quite valuable, I want to keep all of those. By offering away the items I value less (item 2 at 46 per unit and item 4 at 50 per unit) it is very likely that, even though the other party\u2019s preferences are unknown (and their valuations are drawn uniformly), they will see enough value in the offered items to consider accepting.\n\n\u2022 Accordingly, I propose giving the other player all 4 units of item 2 and the 1 unit of item 4. With that proposal:\n\u2003\u2013 My share becomes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2 units \u2192 value = 2\u00d761 = 122\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 0 units \u2192 value = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2 units \u2192 value = 2\u00d777 = 154\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 0 units \u2192 value = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 4 units \u2192 value = 4\u00d793 = 372\n\u2003\u2003Total = 122 + 154 + 372 = 648, which is far above my outside offer.\n\u2003\u2013 The opponent gets: [0, 4, 0, 1, 0]\n\n\u2022 Even if the other party might hold private values that make high\u2010value items seem attractive, by not offering any of the items I value most I am maximizing my own outcome, while still offering them a package (items 2 and 4) that in expectation has decent value.\n\nSince I must make the first offer, I choose to propose this division.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 1, 0]}",

                    "response": "My reasoning is as follows.\n\nStep 1. I note the total available units:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 10 units\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 8 units\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 7 units\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 7 units\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 6 units\n\nStep 2. My private values are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 59\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 39\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 24\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 28\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 83\nSo if I got all items I\u2019d have a total of 1764. However, my outside alternative already offers a value of 942. So any deal I accept must give me at least 942 in value (before discount, since we are in round 1).\n\nStep 3. In making an initial offer I must propose a division of items: I specify the units that I will give to Player 2; I keep the remainder. My \u201cshare value\u201d for myself is computed as:\n\u2003\u2003Value = 59\u00d7(10 \u2013 x\u2081) + 39\u00d7(8 \u2013 x\u2082) + 24\u00d7(7 \u2013 x\u2083) + 28\u00d7(7 \u2013 x\u2084) + 83\u00d7(6 \u2013 x\u2085)\nI want this to be at least 942. At the same time I want to \u201cclaim\u201d as much value as possible provided that Player 2\u2019s share is attractive enough when compared to their unknown outside offer.\n\nStep 4. My rough reasoning is that a fair-split of total value (1764) would yield about 882 for each. That would be below my outside offer of 942. Thus I must get more than half (roughly a 54\u201346 split in value) to make it worthwhile for me. I also know that Item 5 is especially valuable (83 per unit) so I want to keep as many of those as possible while still giving Player 2 enough on the other items so that they may be inclined to accept.\n\nStep 5. One possible division is:\n\u2003\u2003Offer Player 2:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 5 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 4 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2 units\nThen I would keep:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 10 \u2013 5 = 5 units\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 8 \u2013 4 = 4 units\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 7 \u2013 3 = 4 units\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 7 \u2013 3 = 4 units\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 6 \u2013 2 = 4 units\n\nNow, I compute my total value:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 5\u00d759 = 295\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 4\u00d739 = 156\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 4\u00d724 = 96\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 4\u00d728 = 112\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 4\u00d783 = 332\n\u2003\u2003Total = 295 + 156 + 96 + 112 + 332 = 991\n\nThis deal gives me 991, which is safely above my outside guarantee of 942.\n\nStep 6. This division has the benefit of providing Player 2 with a nonzero bundle (one that may compare favorably with his outside option) while ensuring I get a deal that improves on my reservation.\n\nThus, my action in round 1 is to propose the counteroffer of giving Player 2 5, 4, 3, 3, and 2 units of items 1 through 5, respectively.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 4, 3, 3, 2]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since all items sum to a total value of 849 for me, I can \u201cconcede\u201d items worth up to 849 \u2013 732 = 117 in value and still be above my outside offer.\n\nI want to give the other party items that I value relatively low. In my case item 2 is only worth 12 per unit and item 5 is worth 50 per unit. One natural proposal is to concede all 5 units of item 2 (which is 5\u00d712 = 60) and 1 unit of item 5 (worth 50), giving a total conceded value of 60 + 50 = 110.

                    "response": "My analysis is as follows:\n\n1. Total available units are: item1:8, item2:3, item3:3, item4:8, item5:5. My private per\u2010unit values are: 95, 70, 60, 91, and 45 respectively. My maximum total (if I received everything) would be 2103. I also have a very safe fallback (my outside option) of 333, so any deal I propose must give me much more than that.\n\n2. As the first mover I can choose an initial division (an \u201coffer\u201d specifying how many units of each item to give to Player 2; I would then keep the remainder). In a negotiation like this\u2014even though I do not know Player 2\u2019s valuations\u2014it is common to assume that if the offer is too \u201cstingy,\u201d Player 2 will be tempted to counteroffer. However, I also want to maximize my own total value.\n\n3. In my own valuation the items have different \u201cimportance\u201d: item1 (95 per unit) and item4 (91) are very valuable to me, so I would like to keep a relatively larger share of these. Items with lower per\u2010unit value to me (item3 at 60 and item5 at 45) I can afford to cede a bit more, while still reaching an overall division of all items.\n\n4. One reasonable division is to split the items overall roughly in the proportions of 58% for me and 42% for Player 2. For example, if I offer Player 2 the following units:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item1: 3 (so I keep 8\u20133 = 5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item2: 1 (I keep 2)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item3: 2 (I keep 1)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item4: 3 (I keep 5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item5: 3 (I keep 2)\nThen my own value becomes:\n\u2003\u20035\u00d795 = 475,\n\u2003\u20032\u00d770 = 140,\n\u2003\u20031\u00d760 = 60,\n\u2003\u20035\u00d791 = 455, and\n\u2003\u20032\u00d745 = 90.\nSumming up: 475 + 140 + 60 + 455 + 90 = 1220.\nEven though Player 2\u2019s private values are unknown, this split (which in my valuation gives Player 2 a total of 883) is a moderately \u201cfair\u201d division. It gives me a strong advantage while likely being good enough for Player 2 to consider accepting in round 1.\n\n5. This offer leaves me with a payoff of 1220 (well above my outside option of 333) and gives Player 2 a share worth 883 in my eyes\u2014a split that might be acceptable given the impatience imposed by the discount factor (gamma = 0.9) and limited rounds.

(Recall that if I make a counteroffer in round 1 the discount factor is \u03b3^(0)=1, so there is no time discount yet.)\n\nThe totals are:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 4 units (my value per unit = 17)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 5 units (value = 58)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 2 units (value = 11)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 2 units (value = 60)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 2 units (value = 51)\n\nIf I propose a counteroffer in which I \u201cgive\u201d Player\u202f1 some units, my allocation will be the complement (total units minus the offered units).

For his expected valuations (using ~51 per unit), consider:\n\u2003\u2013 Item 1: Offer all 4 units \u2192 expected value \u2248 4\u00d751 = 204.\n\u2003\u2013 Item 2: Offer 0 units (I keep the only unit) \u2192 0.\n\u2003\u2013 Item 3: Out of 7, I propose giving p2 3 units (keeping 4) \u2192 expected value \u2248 3\u00d751 = 153.\n\u2003\u2013 Item 4: Out of 5, I propose giving p2 2 units (keeping 3) \u2192 expected value \u2248 2\u00d751 = 102.\n\u2003\u2013 Item 5: Out of 5, I propose giving p2 2 units (keeping 3) \u2192 expected value \u2248 2\u00d751 = 102.\nSumming these, p2\u2019s expected total value is about 204 + 153 + 102 + 102 = 561. This is in a plausible range given his total potential value (and his unknown outside offer) and should help convince him to consider the deal.\nMeanwhile, my retained items are:\n\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 0\n\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 1 unit \u2192 value = 86\n\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 4 units \u2192 value = 4\u00d749 = 196\n\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 3 units \u2192 value = 3\u00d746 = 138\n\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 3 units \u2192 value = 3\u00d776 = 228\nTotal value for me = 86 + 196 + 138 + 228 = 648, which is well above my outside option of 279.\n\nStep 4: Make my initial offer.\nI must propose a list representing the amounts given to Player 2, so my offer is: [4, 0, 3, 2, 2].\n\nThus, my action is as follows:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 3, 2, 2]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1255. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1002 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 0, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 6, 7, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 6, 7, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I first calculate the value I\u2019d get if I accepted the current offer. The current offer gives me [0,6,7,1,0] units, so:\n\n\u2022 Item 1: 0\u00d778 = 0  \n\u2022 Item 2: 6\u00d767 = 402  \n\u2022 Item 3: 7\u00d793 = 651  \n\u2022 Item 4: 1\u00d781 = 81  \n\u2022 Item 5: 0\u00d715 = 0\n\nTotal = 0 + 402 + 651 + 81 + 0 = 1134.\n\nSince we are in round 2 the deal is discounted by \u03b3^(2\u20131)=0.9, so the present value would be 0.9\u00d71134 = 1020.6. This is below my outside offer value of 1255.\n\nTo beat my outside offer, any negotiated deal reached now must have an undiscoun\u00adted value for me (i.e. the sum of my items\u2019 values) that satisfies:\n\u2003\u2003(my share value)\u00d70.9 \u2265 1255\u2003\u2003\u27f9\u2003\u2003my share value \u2265 1255/0.9 \u2248 1395.\n\nI control the division by making a counteroffer. I can choose to give Player 2 some items (i.e. specify an \u201coffer\u201d vector that represents what I give to them) and keep the rest for myself. The total items available are:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 8 units, item 2: 6, item 3: 7, item 4: 2, item 5: 3.\nIf I denote the counteroffer as [x1,x2,x3,x4,x5] (items I give to Player 2), then my allocation is [8\u2013x1, 6\u2013x2, 7\u2013x3, 2\u2013x4, 3\u2013x5] and my total (undiscounted) value is:\n\u2003\u200378\u00d7(8\u2013x1) + 67\u00d7(6\u2013x2) + 93\u00d7(7\u2013x3) + 81\u00d7(2\u2013x4) + 15\u00d7(3\u2013x5).\n\nI must have this total \u2265 1395. Equivalently, the total \u201cconcession\u201d (the value of items given to Player 2) can be at most 1884 \u2013 1395 = 489 (since the maximum value I get when keeping everything is 1884).\n\nA simple idea is to give away my \u201ccheaper\u201d items in terms of my own valuation. Item 5 is very low (15 per unit) so I can concede all of it (3 units) for a cost of 3\u00d715 = 45. Next, I can consider item 2 (value 67 per unit). If I give away all 6 units, that costs 6\u00d767 = 402. The total concession would then be 45 + 402 = 447, which is less than the maximum 489 I can \u201cafford.\u201d My remaining share\u2019s value becomes 1884 \u2212 447 = 1437, which is above the threshold of 1395. Discounted it yields 0.9\u00d71437 = 1293.3, which clearly beats my outside offer of 1255.\n\nThus, I propose the counteroffer in which I give Player 2:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 0 units  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 6 units  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 0 units  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 0 units  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 3 units\n\nSo my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0,6,0,0,3]}",

A simple division is to offer all of item 1 and all of item 4 to Player 2, keeping items 2, 3, and 5 for ourselves.\n\nStep 6: Let\u2019s calculate our value if we propose:\n\u2003Offer to player2 = [6, 0, 0, 8, 0]\nThat means we receive:\n\u2003item 1: 6\u22126 = 0 units \u2192 0\u00d715 = 0\n\u2003item 2: 3\u22120 = 3 units \u2192 3\u00d797 = 291\n\u2003item 3: 2\u22120 = 2 units \u2192 2\u00d753 = 106\n\u2003item 4: 8\u22128 = 0 units \u2192 0\u00d721 = 0\n\u2003item 5: 3\u22120 = 3 units \u2192 3\u00d749 = 147\nTotal value = 291 + 106 + 147 = 544\n\nStep 7: Our outcome of 544 is better than our outside offer of 430. Meanwhile, by giving player2 all of item1 (6 units) and item4 (8 units), we are offering him items that are of lower value to us but could potentially have a higher expected value for him (since his private values are drawn uniformly between 1 and 101). This division is likely to be acceptable to him, considering his own unknown private values and outside option.\n\nStep 8: As this is our initial action in Round 1, we present the following counteroffer.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \n  \"offer\": [6, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n}",

One way to do this is to allocate nearly all of the high\u2010value items for me but give Player\u00a02 the entire set of item\u00a01 (which is not very valuable to me) and a few additional units from other types to boost their expected deal value.\n\nFor example, if I offer Player\u00a02 exactly:\n\u2003Item 1: 2 units (I value these at 2\u00d73 = 6),\n\u2003Item 2: 2 units,\n\u2003Item 3: 3 units,\n\u2003Item 4: 2 units,\n\u2003Item 5: 1 unit.\nThen my allocation becomes:\n\u2003Item 1: 0 units,\n\u2003Item 2: 1 unit (since 3\u20132 = 1),\n\u2003Item 3: 6 units (9\u20133 = 6),\n\u2003Item 4: 2 units (4\u20132 = 2),\n\u2003Item 5: 0 units.\nMy total value (by my private values) is:\n\u2003Item 2: 1\u00d753 = 53  \n\u2003Item 3: 6\u00d760 = 360  \n\u2003Item 4: 2\u00d725 = 50  \n\u2003Total = 53 + 360 + 50 = 463,\nwhich is well above my outside offer of 263.\n\nFrom Player\u00a02\u2019s perspective (using their typical average per\u2010unit value of about 51), the expected approximate value they would get is:\n\u2003Item 1: 2\u00d751 = 102  \n\u2003Item 2: 2\u00d751 = 102  \n\u2003Item 3: 3\u00d751 = 153  \n\u2003Item 4: 2\u00d751 = 102  \n\u2003Item 5: 1\u00d751 = 51  \n\u2003Approximate total = 102 + 102 + 153 + 102 + 51 = 510.\nThus, Player\u00a02\u2019s expected value is above a likely outside offer (and above what they\u2019d get if the negotiation is delayed and discounted).\n\nThis deal favors me (463 > 263) while it still gives Player\u00a02 an attractive expected return (\u2248510) so they are likely to eventually agree. Hence, as my opening move in round 1, I will offer the division where I give Player\u00a02 the quantities [2, 2, 3, 2, 1].\n\nTherefore, my response is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 3, 2, 1]}",

Thus it makes sense to offer P1 the bulk (or all) of item\u00a03 if possible. Note that if I give all 9 units of item\u00a03, then the \u201cconcession\u201d in my value is 9\u00d711 = 99, which is within the allowed 111.

The concession in our value is 5\u00d718 = 90, leaving us with a residual share value of 393 \u2013 90 = 303. This is safely above our outside offer value of 298.\n\u2022 Under this counteroffer, we would be offering Player 1:\n\u2003Item1: 0, Item2: 0, Item3: 5, Item4: 0, Item5: 0.\n\u2022 Our resulting share (the complement) is:\n\u2003Item1: 3, Item2: 5, Item3: 6\u20135 = 1, Item4: 0, Item5: 1.\n\u2022 Our value then is:\n\u20033\u00d736 + 5\u00d719 + 1\u00d718 + 0\u00d712 + 1\u00d782 = 108 + 95 + 18 + 0 + 82 = 303.\n\u2022 This meets our goal of being above our outside offer.

To entice them to agree now (and not later or try to push for a division that gives them even more of what may be their strong items), I should concede slightly on item\u20092. In other words, I can offer them a little bit of item\u20092 along with all of the low\u2010value item\u20093. \n\nA natural counteroffer is then to give player\u20092: \n\u20030 units of item\u20091,\n\u20031 unit of item\u20092,\n\u2003all 6 units of item\u20093,\n\u20030 of item\u20094,\n\u20030 of item\u20095.\nWith this counteroffer, my allocation becomes:\n\u2003Item\u20091: 3 \u2013 0 = 3\u2003\u21d2 300\n\u2003Item\u20092: 5 \u2013 1 = 4\u2003\u21d2 4\u00d796 = 384\n\u2003Item\u20093: 6 \u2013 6 = 0\u2003\u21d2 0\n\u2003Item\u20095: 1 \u2013 0 = 1\u2003\u21d2 94\nSo my total value = 300 + 384 + 94 = 778, and because we are in round\u20092 the present value is 778\u00d70.9 \u2248 700.2, which is extremely attractive compared to my outside offer of 230.\n\nThus, I will make the following move: \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 6, 0, 0]}",

This would leave me with:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 all of item1: 3 units (3\u00d7100 = 300)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 all of item2: 5 units (5\u00d796 = 480)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 all of item5: 1 unit (1\u00d794 = 94)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 and 0 units of item3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This gives me a raw value of 300 + 480 + 94 = 874. Discounting yields 874\u00d70.81 \u2248 707.9 \u2014 far above my outside option.\n6. Although I do not know Player 2\u2019s private values, offering all 6 units of item3 (which I value very little) is likely to be attractive to them if they see promise in item3. If they reject my counteroffer, I fall back on my outside offer (230), but if they accept I secure a high payoff.\n7. Therefore, my counteroffer is to give Player 2 all 6 units of item3 and keep the rest for myself.\n\nMy action is:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]}",

That gives us:\n\u2003\u2022 item\u00a01: 1 unit \u2192 1\u00d750 = 50\n\u2003\u2022 item\u00a03: 2 units \u2192 2\u00d769 = 138\n\u2003\u2022 (items\u00a02,4,5: 0 units)\nfor a total value of 50 + 138 = 188. This is below our outside offer value of 201. Thus, accepting is not good.\n\nWhen we propose a counteroffer, we specify what we give to Player\u00a01; we then receive whatever remains from the totals:\n\u2003\u2022 Total quantities: item1:4, item2:0, item3:4, item4:2, item5:3.\n\u2003\u2022 If our counteroffer is X = [x\u2081, x\u2082, x\u2083, x\u2084, x\u2085], then our allocation is [4\u2013x\u2081, 0, 4\u2013x\u2083, 2\u2013x\u2084, 3\u2013x\u2085].\n\nOur aim is to secure a deal that gives us a present (undiscounted) value higher than our outside offer (201). One natural idea is to \u201cpush\u201d Player\u00a01\u2019s offer a bit so that we get extra value. Notice that in Player\u00a01\u2019s offer we would get 0 units of item4 (worth 13 each to us). By \u201cclaiming\u201d one extra unit of item4 (i.e. by keeping a unit that otherwise would have gone to Player\u00a01), we add 13 points to our current 188, reaching 201 exactly. However, to make the division appealing (and possibly acceptable to Player\u00a01) we want to \u201csplit\u201d the total surplus fairly according to our own valuations.\n\nOur full pie (by our values) is:\n\u2003item1: 4\u00d750 = 200,\n\u2003item3: 4\u00d769 = 276,\n\u2003item4: 2\u00d713 = 26,\n\u2003item5: 3\u00d715 = 45.\nTotal = 200 + 276 + 26 + 45 = 547.\n\nA natural \u201cfair\u201d split (by our measure) is 547 being divided as 201 for one party and 346 for the other. (Notice 346 + 201 = 547.) Since our outside offer gives us 201 if no deal is reached, we must obtain at least something higher via agreement. By leaving Player\u00a01 items that we (by our measure) value as 201 and taking the remaining 346 for ourselves we maximize our gain while giving Player\u00a01 what (by our expectation) might be their reservation level.\n\nTo get exactly this split we must choose our counteroffer X so that our allocation is exactly:\n\u2003\u2022 item1: 4\u2013x\u2081,\n\u2003\u2022 item3: 4\u2013x\u2083,\n\u2003\u2022 item4: 2\u2013x\u2084,\n\u2003\u2022 item5: 3\u2013x\u2085,\nwith the following value for us:\n\u200350(4\u2013x\u2081) + 69(4\u2013x\u2083) + 13(2\u2013x\u2084) + 15(3\u2013x\u2085) = 346.\nA very natural and simple adjustment from Player\u00a01\u2019s offer [1,0,2,0,0] is to ask that we \u201ckeep\u201d one unit more of one of the lower\u2010impact items \u2013 in this case, item4. Thus if we propose to give Player\u00a01 the offer:\n\u2003[1, 0, 2, 1, 0]\nthen our allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2022 item1: 4 \u2013 1 = 3 units \u2192 3\u00d750 = 150,\n\u2003\u2022 item3: 4 \u2013 2 = 2 units \u2192 2\u00d769 = 138,\n\u2003\u2022 item4: 2 \u2013 1 = 1 unit \u2192 1\u00d713 = 13,\n\u2003\u2022 item5: 3 \u2013 0 = 3 units \u2192 3\u00d715 = 45.\nTotal for us = 150 + 138 + 13 + 45 = 346.\n\nPlayer\u00a01\u2019s allocation in this proposal would be:\n\u2003\u2022 item1: 1 unit,\n\u2003\u2022 item3: 2 units,\n\u2003\u2022 item4: 1 unit,\n\u2003\u2022 item5: all 3 units,\nwhich (by our measure) sums to 50 + 138 + 13 = 201. This division exactly splits the total \u201cpie\u201d (547) into 346 for us and 201 for Player\u00a01. (We note that although we use our own values to judge, this ensures we get well above our fallback while giving Player\u00a01 an \u201cindifferent\u201d payoff relative to their likely outside offer.)\n\nSince 346 > 201, we improve over our outside option.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 584. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1104 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Step 1: Determine our total values if we got all the items. Our items are: 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. Our per\u2010unit values are 45, 100, 92, 80, and 51 respectively. So if we kept all items our value would be:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 4 \u00d7 45 = 180\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 1 \u00d7 100 = 100\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3 \u00d7 92 = 276\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 5 \u00d7 80 = 400\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\nTotal = 180 + 100 + 276 + 400 + 102 = 1058.\n\nStep 2: Our outside offer is worth 584. Therefore, any deal we agree to must give us a value (without discount, since we\u2019re in round 1) strictly above 584 if we want to do better than simply taking our outside offer.\n\nStep 3: We want to propose an offer that maximizes our outcome while also giving Player 2 enough so they are likely to accept the deal rather than walking away (bearing in mind they have some unknown outside offer and will also consider the future discount factor). \nObserving our item values, note that:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2 is very valuable for us (100) and it\u2019s only one unit. We should keep it.\n\u2003\u2022 Similarly, items such as item 3 (92 per unit) are valuable. \nThus, we can try to \u201csqueeze\u201d a minimal yet \u201cacceptable\u201d bundle for Player 2 with some tokens of the remaining items.\n\nStep 4: One candidate proposal is to offer Player 2:\n\u2003\u2022 For item 1 (4 units total): Give 1 unit (keep 3 units).\n\u2003\u2022 For item 2 (1 unit total): Give 0 unit (keep 1 unit).\n\u2003\u2022 For item 3 (3 units total): Give 1 unit (keep 2 units).\n\u2003\u2022 For item 4 (5 units total): Give 2 units (keep 3 units).\n\u2003\u2022 For item 5 (2 units total): Give 1 unit (keep 1 unit).\n\nStep 5: Calculate our resulting value:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 1 \u00d7 100 = 100\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2 \u00d7 92 = 184\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3 \u00d7 80 = 240\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\nTotal = 135 + 100 + 184 + 240 + 51 = 710.\n\nSince 710 exceeds our outside offer value of 584, this deal is beneficial for us. At the same time, it leaves Player 2 some items to work with, which might encourage them to accept the deal in round 1.\n\nStep 6: Based on the above analysis, I propose the following counteroffer in the required JSON format.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]}",

Since I value the full bundle at 931, any deal giving me less than 265 isn\u2019t attractive; so I want to ensure my \u201cshare\u201d in any deal exceeds 265 when discounted. In round 1 there is no discount (\u03b3^(r\u20131)=1), so my goal is a deal that\u2019s clearly better than 265 while also giving Player\u00a02 an incentive to reach agreement.\n\nI can \u201cdesign\u201d a proposal by choosing how many units of each item to give to Player\u00a02. (By definition our offer is what Player\u00a02 gets; I get what remains.) A balanced starting point is to try a near\u201350:50 split (according to my own valuations). With my per\u2013unit values:\n\u2003\u2022 item1: 18\u2003(total 3)\n\u2003\u2022 item2: 64\u2003(total 6)\n\u2003\u2022 item3: 100\u2003(total 2)\n\u2003\u2022 item4: 91\u2003(total 3)\n\u2003\u2022 item5: 5\u2003(total 4)\nI looked for a split so that the sum\u2010of\u2013my\u2013values for the items given to Player\u00a02 is roughly 466 (with me keeping 465 out of 931). One way to achieve this is to assign to Player\u00a02:\n\u2003\u2022 2 units of item1: 2\u00d718 = 36\n\u2003\u2022 2 units of item2: 2\u00d764 = 128\n\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item3: 1\u00d7100 = 100\n\u2003\u2022 2 units of item4: 2\u00d791 = 182\n\u2003\u2022 all 4 units of item5: 4\u00d75 = 20\nThe total (from my perspective) is 36+128+100+182+20 = 466 for Player\u00a02. (That leaves me with 1 unit of item1, 4 units of item2, 1 unit of item3, 1 unit of item4, and 0 of item5; my value then is 18+256+100+91 = 465.) This division is clearly above my outside guarantee while it is \u201cfair\u2010looking\u201d from my view and might give Player\u00a02 enough incentive to agree in round\u00a01.\n\nThus, my action is to propose a counteroffer with the offer array [2, 2, 1, 2, 4].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 2, 4]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

In round 2 I therefore need an allocation to myself (that is, the complement of the offer I propose to player\u20052) whose undiscounted total value is at least 153/0.9, i.e. about 170. (I actually want much more than that so that I capture nearly all of the many high\u2010value items.)\nLooking at my private values\u2014\n\u2003item 1 (2 units): value 100 each,\n\u2003item 3 (2 units): 66 each,\n\u2003item 4 (4 units): 43 each\u2014\nI treasure these items highly and want to keep them.\nOn the other hand, item 2 is worth 42 per unit and item 5 is worth only 2 per unit for me.\nThus, a good strategy is to \u201cbuy\u201d player\u20052\u2019s acceptance by offering them only a little extra from the items I value less (especially item 5, where giving up a unit costs me very little) while keeping almost everything of the very high\u2010valued items.\nI can, for instance, offer player\u20052 the following bundle:\n\u2003\u2022 0 of item 1 (I keep both),\n\u2003\u2022 1 of item 2 (so they get a little from that category),\n\u2003\u2022 0 of item 3,\n\u2003\u2022 0 of item 4,\n\u2003\u2022 3 of item 5 (I\u2019m giving up almost all of item 5, which is nearly worthless to me).\nThen my allocation becomes the complement:\n\u2003\u2022 item 1: 2 \u2013 0 = 2 units\u2003\u2003\u2192 2\u00d7100 = 200,\n\u2003\u2022 item 2: 5 \u2013 1 = 4 units\u2003\u2003\u2192 4\u00d742 = 168,\n\u2003\u2022 item 3: 2 \u2013 0 = 2 units\u2003\u2003\u2192 2\u00d766 = 132,\n\u2003\u2022 item 4: 4 \u2013 0 = 4 units\u2003\u2003\u2192 4\u00d743 = 172,\n\u2003\u2022 item 5: 3 \u2013 3 = 0 units\u2003\u2003\u2192 0.\nSo my total undiscounted value would be 200 + 168 + 132 + 172 = 672 (and discounted it is 0.9\u00d7672 = 604.8). This is far above the 153 I can safely get from my outside offer.\nAt the same time the offer gives player\u20052 a bundle of:\n\u2003\u2022 item 1: 0,\n\u2003\u2022 item 2: 1,\n\u2003\u2022 item 3: 0,\n\u2003\u2022 item 4: 0,\n\u2003\u2022 item 5: 3.\nWhile I don\u2019t know player\u20052\u2019s precise values, I expect\u2014given that their valuations are drawn from 1 to 101\u2014that even 1 unit of item\u20052 plus 3 units of item\u20055 would be attractive to them, especially compared to what was on the table in earlier rounds.\nThus, by counteroffering with [0, 1, 0, 0, 3] I keep almost all of the extremely high\u2010value items for myself while offering player\u20052 a chance to get a reasonable payoff. \n\nMy action is therefore:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 3]}",

This is much lower than my outside offer of 639.\n\nIf I try to counteroffer, I must remember that in any counteroffer I propose I state how many units (of each item) I give to Player 1; I would then receive the complementary bundle. My negotiation reserve (when un-discounted) is determined by:\n\u2003\u2003My share\u2019s nominal value \u2265 639/0.9 = 710.\nSince the total nominal value of all items is 839, I can \u201cafford\u201d to concede at most 839 \u2013 710 = 129 points (in my value units).

In essence, any counteroffer that ensures I beat my outside offer would leave Player\u00a01 with a very unattractive bundle relative to what they already have on the table. \n\nThus, my best option is not to risk a counteroffer that\u2013even if accepted later\u2013would leave me with a discounted value only marginally above my outside offer while likely provoking Player\u00a01 to reject. Given that my guaranteed outside offer of 639 is much better than the present discounted value of the current offer (\u2248125) and that there is no feasible counteroffer that can give me (after discounting) significantly more than 639 without leaving Player\u00a01 an attractive alternative, I must WALK away and take my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [6, 0, 0, 0, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [6, 0, 0, 0, 6]\n\n    What is your action?

If I try to propose a counteroffer, to do better than my reservation I must secure a package (what I keep) worth at least 1293 in my own valuation. Because my item values add up to 1551 if I got everything, to get at least 1293 I would have to take nearly all the high\u2010value items. In effect I would be asking player\u00a01 to accept getting only the items I value the least\u2014even though player\u00a01\u2019s own values are unknown, they would likely expect a much larger share (for example, note that in player\u00a01\u2019s own offer they kept a package which by my rough estimate is worth roughly 663 in my \u201caverage\u201d terms, and player\u00a01\u2019s outside option is likely in a similar vicinity to their total value expectation). \n\nAny counteroffer in which I leave myself with over 1293 (by, say, keeping almost all of item\u00a01, item\u00a02, and item\u00a05) forces me to concede only a very small portion of the other items (like item\u00a03 or one unit of item\u00a04) to player\u00a01. That package for player\u00a01 is very likely well below what they might expect from their own outside offer and from the deal they originally signaled. In consequence, a counteroffer would probably be rejected and the negotiations would then fall to my outside option of 1293.\n\nGiven that the current offer gives me only 756 (which is far below my reservation) and any negotiated deal that would improve this would almost certainly require me to give away so much as to jeopardize player\u00a01\u2019s acceptance, the best course of action in round\u00a01 is to WALK away to secure my outside offer of 1293.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

For Item 4, while it is worth 59 each to me, it might be useful to offer a small quantity (1 unit) to make the deal more attractive to Player 2 so they consider it over their outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I first note that if I accept the current offer [0,0,0,0,1] I would get just 1 unit of item 5, which is worth 84 (1\u00d784) to me. That is far below my outside option of 1044, so accepting would be a terrible deal.\n\nI want to propose a counteroffer such that the bundle I receive (i.e. the items not given over to Player 1) provides me a total value (according to my private values) that is above my outside option of 1044. My values are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 22\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 84\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 51\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 77\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 84\nand the total available units are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 6\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 8\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 5\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 5\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2\n\nIt makes sense to keep those items where I get high per\u2010unit utility (specifically items 2, 4, and 5) and offer over to Player 1 the items that are \u201ccheaper\u201d for me (items 1 and 3). One natural counteroffer is to give Player 1 all units of item 1 and item 3. In that case my bundle becomes:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 6 \u2013 6 = 0\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 8 \u2013 0 = 8\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 5 \u2013 5 = 0\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 5 \u2013 0 = 5\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2 \u2013 0 = 2\n\nMy total value then calculates to:\n\u2003Item 2: 8\u00d784 = 672\n\u2003Item 4: 5\u00d777 = 385\n\u2003Item 5: 2\u00d784 = 168\n\u2003Total = 672 + 385 + 168 = 1225\n\nSince 1225 exceeds my outside option of 1044, I have an incentive to reach a deal. (Of course Player 1\u2019s acceptance depends on their private values and outside option, but by offering them the full quantities of the low-valued (to me) items, I at least present a proposal that maximizes my share while conceding a bundle that may be valuable to them.)\n\nBased on this reasoning, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 0, 5, 0, 0]}",

My private values per unit are: item1=94, item2=40, item3=74, item4=60, and item5=71; while the total available counts are [3, 3, 3, 5, 3]. Notice that I have very high valuations for items 1, 3, and 5 compared with the average (which for Player 2\u2014drawn uniformly between 1 and 101\u2014would be about 51). In contrast, item2 (my value 40) and item4 (my value 60) are \u201ccheaper\u201d for me. \n\nThus, I can try to design an offer that gives Player 2 all of item2 (the full 3 units) and some of item4, while I keep all of items 1, 3, and 5. For instance, if I offer Player 2: \n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item1,\n\u2003\u2022 all 3 units of item2,\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item3,\n\u2003\u2022 2 units of item4 (out of 5), and \n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item5,\nthen I would keep:\n\u2003\u2022 item1: 3 units,\n\u2003\u2022 item2: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2022 item3: 3 units,\n\u2003\u2022 item4: 3 units (since 5\u20132=3),\n\u2003\u2022 item5: 3 units.\n\nMy total \u201cdeal\u2010value\u201d would then be:\n\u2003\u2022 item1: 3\u00d794 = 282\n\u2003\u2022 item3: 3\u00d774 = 222\n\u2003\u2022 item4: 3\u00d760 = 180\n\u2003\u2022 item5: 3\u00d771 = 213\nAdding these \u2009\u2003282+222+180+213 = 897.\nSince this is well over my outside offer of 19 (and we are in round 1 so no discount), this outcome is attractive to me. \n\nI expect that by handing over the \u201ccheaper\u201d items (which I value less) and a fraction of item4, I am providing Player 2 with enough \u201cgood\u201d stuff (they get all of item2 and a share of item4) so that they might consider the offer acceptable. \n\nThus, my action is to propose a counteroffer with the offer array [0, 3, 0, 2, 0].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 2, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 298. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 738 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I first note that if we reach an agreement the present\u2010value payoff is not discounted (\u03b3^(r\u20131)=1 in round 1) and my outside offer guarantees me 298 in value. Since my total value for all items is 1250, I must be sure to get a share worth at least 298. I also want to \u201cpush\u201d as much value onto myself as possible while still offering Player 2 enough so that they prefer accepting rather than trying for a later (discounted) deal or their own outside offer.\n\nA standard idea in these games is to try to claim the items that are most valuable to me while \u201coffloading\u201d those that I value less. My private per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 53\u2003 (3 units; total 159)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 54\u2003 (5 units; total 270)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 21\u2003 (4 units; total 84)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 89\u2003 (6 units; total 534)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 29\u2003 (7 units; total 203)\nTotal = 1250.\n\nNotice that item 4 (worth 89 per unit) and items 1 and 2 are especially valuable to me. In contrast, items 3 (only 21 per unit) and 5 (29 per unit) are lower\u2010valued from my perspective\u2014even though Player 2 might privately value them more.\n\nI can \u201cbuy\u201d my own guarantee (298) by keeping a relatively small share; however, to discourage Player 2 from trying to prolong the negotiation (and risk discounting their eventual gain by factor 0.9 in future rounds) it is good to offer them enough value from my perspective so that they\u2019re likely to accept. A roughly \u201cfair\u2010appearing\u201d initial offer is one that gives Player 2 about 40\u201350% of the total value as I see it. (A 50\u201350 split in total value would be about 625 each. However, since my aim is to maximize my outcome, I want to offer just slightly less than half to Player 2 while still making their offer attractive relative to their outside option.)\n\nOne candidate allocation is as follows. I offer Player 2:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 1 unit (leaving 2 for me; gives me 53)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 2 units (leaving 3 for me; gives me 2\u00d754=108 less value lost)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: All 4 units (since its low value for me)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 1 unit (keeping most of the high\u2010value item)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: All 7 units (again, offload the lower priority item)\n\nLet\u2019s check what that means from my perspective:\n\u2003\u2013 My \u201coffer\u201d to Player 2 (the items they get) has value:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 1\u00d753 = 53\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 2\u00d754 = 108\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 4\u00d721 = 84\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 1\u00d789 = 89\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 7\u00d729 = 203\n\u2003\u2003Total offered (value for me) = 53+108+84+89+203 = 537.\n\u2003\u2013 That leaves me with:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2 units (2\u00d753 = 106)\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 3 units (3\u00d754 = 162)\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 0 units (0)\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 5 units (5\u00d789 = 445)\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 0 units (0)\n\u2003\u2003Total kept = 106+162+445 = 713.\n\nThis division gives me 713 in value, which is well above my outside offer guarantee (298) while offering Player 2 an allocation worth 537 in my valuation. Although I do not know Player 2\u2019s private values, this division uses my information advantage by keeping most of the items I value highly (item 4, and parts of items 1 and 2) and offering a \u201creasonable\u201d share (537 vs. 713) that might be acceptable considering the discounting in later rounds.\n\nThus, my action in round 1 is to propose the division in which I give Player 2 the following: [1, 2, 4, 1, 7].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 4, 1, 7]}",

You then get the remaining items. Given you already know your item values, you want to secure a share that gives you a value above your outside offer while leaving Player\u00a01 a share likely good enough for acceptance.\n\nStep 3: A \u201cbalanced\u201d (roughly 50/50 in terms of total potential value within your view) division is a reasonable starting point. Total available items and your corresponding total value is 1356. An equal split in value would give each roughly 678 (if the valuations were common). Since your current offer would leave you with only 316 value, you aim for a division much more favorable for you.\n\nStep 4: One possible split is to offer Player\u00a01:\n\u2022 2 units of item 1 (out of 3)  \n\u2022 2 units of item 2 (out of 5)  \n\u2022 2 units of item 3 (out of 4)  \n\u2022 4 units of item 4 (out of 8)  \n\u2022 1 unit of item 5 (out of 3)  \n\nThen you would keep:\n\u2022 Item 1: 1 (value: 1\u00d714 = 14)  \n\u2022 Item 2: 3 (value: 3\u00d752 = 156)  \n\u2022 Item 3: 2 (value: 2\u00d766 = 132)  \n\u2022 Item 4: 4 (value: 4\u00d786 = 344)  \n\u2022 Item 5: 2 (value: 2\u00d734 = 68)  \nYour total = 14 + 156 + 132 + 344 + 68 = 714, which is well above your fallback of 363.\n\nStep 5: This division appears fair in that it gives Player\u00a01 a reasonable share while ensuring your value is high. Lacking precise knowledge of the other player\u2019s private values, splitting high\u2010value items (like item 4) evenly and keeping more of the items that are lower in value to you (when possible) is a reasonable way to ensure acceptance.\n\nThus, your action in round 1 is to make the counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 4, 1]}",

In round 1 a \u201cgood\u201d proposal will be one where my share (the leftover items) gives me a much larger total value when I multiply each item\u2019s units by my per\u2010unit values.\n\n2. The totals are: item 1: 4 units, item 2: 2, item 3: 5, item 4: 2, item 5: 8.\n   My values per unit are: 4, 74, 100, 64, 50 respectively. This means I especially favor items 2 (74), 3 (100) and 4 (64). Item 5 is moderately valuable, and item 1 is relatively low in value (4 per unit).\n\n3. Since I want to maximize my outcome value while making an offer attractive enough for Player 2 to consider, I can offer Player 2 the items I value relatively low. I therefore propose giving Player 2 all of item 1 (4 units) and a portion of item 5 (4 units) while keeping all of item 2, item 3, and item 4 and the remaining 4 units of item 5.\n\n4. Under this proposal, my allocation becomes:\n   \u2022 Item 1: 4 total \u2013 4 given = 0 units \u2192 0 \u00d7 4 = 0  \n   \u2022 Item 2: 2 total \u2013 0 given = 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 74 = 148  \n   \u2022 Item 3: 5 total \u2013 0 given = 5 units \u2192 5 \u00d7 100 = 500  \n   \u2022 Item 4: 2 total \u2013 0 given = 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 64 = 128  \n   \u2022 Item 5: 8 total \u2013 4 given = 4 units \u2192 4 \u00d7 50 = 200  \n   Total value = 0 + 148 + 500 + 128 + 200 = 976, which is far above my outside offer of 17.\n\n5. Meanwhile, offering Player 2 all of item 1 (which I value very little) and half of item 5 provides them with a potentially attractive stake\u2014especially since Player 2\u2019s values per unit are unknown and might favor those items.\n\nThus, my initial counteroffer is to give Player 2: [4, 0, 0, 0, 4].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 0, 0, 4]}",

My value for that is \n\n\u2003\u2003item 1: 4\u00d79 = 36  \n\u2003\u2003item 5: 4\u00d774 = 296  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Total = 36+296 = 332  \n\nThis 332 is far below the value of my outside offer, which is 668. So accepting is not acceptable to me.\n\nNow I must propose a counteroffer. When we propose a counteroffer, we \u201coffer\u201d to give the other player some units, and we \u201ckeep\u201d the remainder.

That means I can safely give away all of the items in which my per\u2010unit value is relatively lower (items 1, 2, and 3) without dropping below my reservation value.\n\nThus, one proposal that gives me 746 is to offer to Player 1 everything in items 1, 2, and 3 and keep all of items 4 and 5 for myself. In other words, I would propose a counteroffer that gives Player 1:\n\u2003\u2003item 1: 4  \n\u2003\u2003item 2: 2  \n\u2003\u2003item 3: 5  \n\u2003\u2003item 4: 0  \n\u2003\u2003item 5: 0\n\nThen my remaining share would be:\n\u2003\u2003item 1: 4\u22124 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003item 2: 2\u22122 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003item 3: 5\u22125 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003item 4: 2\u22120 = 2  \n\u2003\u2003item 5: 8\u22120 = 8\n\nMy value then is 2\u00d777 + 8\u00d774 = 154 + 592 = 746, which exceeds my outside offer value of 668.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t know Player 1\u2019s private values, it is plausible that he may particularly value the items in which I have low value (items 1, 2, and 3) so that this offer might appeal to him. (Of course, if he rejects it the negotiation may break down, but since the alternative is his unknown outside offer\u2014and here I protect my own value\u2014the proposal seems justified.)\n\nThus, my action is to make this counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 5, 0, 0]}",

However, if I offer nothing of item\u00a02, there is risk Player\u00a02 (whose private values I don\u2019t know) might expect some share on that type. \n\nSo one reasonable plan is to offer Player\u00a02:\n\u2003\u2022 All 2 units of item\u00a01 (since 2\u00d74 = 8, a low cost for me)\n\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item\u00a02 (leaving me 3 units, which still gives me 3\u00d752 = 156)\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item\u00a03 (I want to keep all 5 units because of its high value of 85/unit)\n\u2003\u2022 2 units of item\u00a04 (splitting evenly the 4 available; I keep 2, worth 2\u00d735 = 70)\n\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item\u00a05 (keeping 1 for myself, 1\u00d733 = 33)\n\nUnder this proposed offer my share comes out as:\n\u2003Item\u00a01: 0 units\u2003\u2003\u2192  0\u00d74 = 0  \n\u2003Item\u00a02: 3 units\u2003\u2003\u2192  3\u00d752 = 156  \n\u2003Item\u00a03: 5 units\u2003\u2003\u2192  5\u00d785 = 425  \n\u2003Item\u00a04: 2 units\u2003\u2003\u2192  2\u00d735 = 70  \n\u2003Item\u00a05: 1 unit\u2003\u2003\u2192  1\u00d733 = 33  \nTotal = 684  \n\nThis value (684) is well above my outside offer of 114. Meanwhile, the offer gives Player\u00a02 a nontrivial share of items. Although I don\u2019t know their values, allocating moderate amounts from item\u00a01 (which I don't value much) and some from items\u00a02, 4, and 5 should provide them with decent potential value\u2014likely enough to beat their outside option. \n\nThus, I will open negotiations with the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 2, 1]}",

(It also gives Player\u202f1 a complement that, if they value items similarly, might be attractive even though their private values could be different.)\n\nIn round\u202f1 it is beneficial for me to move away from the unattractive current offer and propose this division.

Since 602 < 689, accepting means I\u2019d get a worse outcome than my guaranteed alternative.\n\n\u2022 As Player 2, I could try to structure a counteroffer giving me at least 689 (for example, by taking more of my high\u2013valued items like item 3) but then I\u2019d have to give player1 fewer items. Without knowing player1\u2019s values or outside offer, there\u2019s a high risk he may reject a counteroffer that gives him less than what he expects. Additionally, if we delay and move to later rounds, the discount factor (\u03b3 = 0.9) will reduce the payoff from any eventual agreement.\n\n\u2022 Given that my immediate guaranteed value (689) exceeds the value from accepting the current offer (602) and that a risky counteroffer might either be rejected or lead to further discounting, the safe and rational action is to WALK away.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

I consider that I value certain items much more than others. My highest values are items 4 (62) and 3 (56); in contrast I value items 1 (18), 2 (31) and 5 (5) relatively less. Thus I want to offer Player 1 more units of these lower\u2010value items.\n\nOne candidate is to offer Player 1:\n\u2003Item 1: 4 units  \n\u2003Item 2: 2 units  \n\u2003Item 3: 0 units  \n\u2003Item 4: 0 units  \n\u2003Item 5: 4 units\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n\u2022 Are the offers feasible?

However, I have an outside offer worth 321 (which is the minimum I must do better than).\n2. I must propose an initial division where I offer Player 2 some units of items (the \u201coffer\u201d list) and I keep what remains. My resulting value (using my private values) must be above 321.\n3. For instance, if I offer Player 2 the following allocation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 3 units (so I keep 5 \u2013 3 = 2 units; my value: 2\u00d720 = 40)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 1 unit (I keep 3; my value: 3\u00d793 = 279)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2 units (I keep 3; my value: 3\u00d741 = 123)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3 units (I keep 4; my value: 4\u00d736 = 144)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 1 unit (I keep 2; my value: 2\u00d72 = 4)\n4. Adding up my values: 40 + 279 + 123 + 144 + 4 = 590. Since 590 > 321, I secure a value above my fallback.\n5. Although Player 2\u2019s private values are unknown, this offer gives them a share\u2014according to my own valuation\u2014of:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 3\u00d720 = 60\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 1\u00d793 = 93\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2\u00d741 = 82\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3\u00d736 = 108\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 1\u00d72 = 2\n\u2003\u2003Total = 345.\n6. This moderate concession may be acceptable to Player 2, while leaving me with a high value.

On the other hand, I am willing to concede items 2 and 4 fully (there are 4 units each) since they give me little value. However, to get player 1 to agree (so he doesn\u2019t prefer his fallback bundle of [7, 0, 3, 0, 4]) I need to give him some of the \u201chigh\u2013value\u201d items too. \n\nA reasonable compromise is to propose a division in which I offer player 1: \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 4 units from item 1 (so he gets 4 instead of 7),  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 all 4 units from item 2,  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit from item 3 (instead of 3),  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 all 4 units from item 4, and  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 2 units from item 5 (instead of 4).\n\nThat is, I propose to offer him [4, 4, 1, 4, 2]. (Remember that in our negotiation protocol, a counteroffer is given as the package we offer to player 1; by default I keep the leftovers.) \n\nThen I would keep:  \n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 7 \u2013 4 = 3 units  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 4 \u2013 4 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 3 \u2013 1 = 2  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 4 \u2013 4 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 4 \u2013 2 = 2\n\nMy value becomes:  \n\u2003\u20033\u00d798 + 2\u00d794 + 2\u00d795 = 294 + 188 + 190 = 672\n\nThis just beats my outside option of 664. It also gives player 1 a bundle (4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 2 of item 5) that is a mix \u2013 even though it involves giving up some of the items he would get from his current offer (which would have been [7, 0, 3, 0, 4]), the full concession on items 2 and 4 may help make the deal acceptable for him.\n\nGiven that 672 > 664 and I\u2019m trying to maximize my payoff while offering player 1 something that could be acceptable, I will therefore make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 4, 1, 4, 2]}",

My own per\u2010unit values are extremely high on item\u00a01 (86 per unit) and more modest on the others (18, 16, 21, and 13). Because item\u00a01 is so valuable to me I\u2019d prefer to keep as many of those as possible\u2014but if I give too little, Player\u00a02 might dislike the deal if they in fact value item\u00a01 highly. A common tactic is to concede a little on the highest\u2010value item so that the opponent sees that I\u2019m not \u201ctaking everything,\u201d while conceding more of the items that matter less to me (since those items might be relatively more valuable to them or at least \u201ccheap\u201d for me to part with).\n\nA strategy I considered was:\n\u2003\u2022 For item\u00a01 (4 available): Give 1 unit to Player\u00a02 and keep 3.

(My value for each item is my private (per\u2010unit) value multiplied by the number of units I end up with.) The totals available are\n\n\u2003\u2003item1:\u20034 units  \n\u2003\u2003item2:\u20036 units  \n\u2003\u2003item3:\u20033 units  \n\u2003\u2003item4:\u20038 units  \n\u2003\u2003item5:\u20034 units\n\nand my per\u2010unit values are item1 = 76, item2 = 14, item3 = 26, item4 = 62, and item5 = 76. (My total \u201cfull\u2010package\u201d value is 1266.) I also have an outside option that guarantees me 803 value.\n\nA \u201cgood\u201d offer must (a) give me a share (i.e. the items I keep) that is worth at least 803 by my own numbers and (b) be \u201cattractive\u201d enough that player\u00a02 (whose private values we do not know but who on average \u201csees\u201d the items as having roughly a midpoint value) instead of walking \u2013 that is, the package I offer them should be competitive with what they expect by \u201cdisagreement.\u201d\n\nFor instance, note that \u2013 from my perspective \u2013 I value items 1 and 5 very highly (76 per unit) and item4 almost as high (62 per unit), while items 2 (14 per unit) and 3 (26 per unit) are \u201ccheaper\u201d for me. A common tactic is to \u201cconcede\u201d (offer entirely) the units of the \u201clow\u2010value\u201d items so that player\u00a02 gets many units of something that might be more valuable to them. (When the \u201coutside option\u201d is drawn from the total value, player\u00a02\u2019s contract offer will likely come out higher than what I \u201cfeel\u201d for those low\u2013value items.) In order not to \u201churt\u201d my own outcome, the amount I give away in terms of my own valuations must be no more than 1266 \u2013 803 = 463 in \u201cconcession value.\u201d\n\nOne possibility is as follows. Suppose I \u201cgive\u201d player\u00a02 all of items 2 and 3. That yields by my numbers \n\u2003\u2003item2: 6 \u00d7 14 = 84  \n\u2003\u2003item3: 3 \u00d7 26 = 78  \n\u2003\u2003concession = 84 + 78 = 162.\nThat leaves 463 \u2013 162 = 301 \u201cvalue units\u201d that I can concede from items where my per\u2013unit value is higher. But I do not want to give away too many of the highest\u2010value items (items\u00a01 and 5) because they are 76 per unit; however, it is plausible that player\u00a02 expects to value those items highly too so giving them a few units helps \u201csell\u201d the proposal.\nOne reasonable initial offer is then to \u201cgive\u201d player\u00a02:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 1\u2003\u2003(1 \u00d7 76 = 76)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 all 6 units of item 2\u2003\u2003(84)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 all 3 units of item 3\u2003\u2003(78)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 4\u2003\u2003(62)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 2 units of item 5\u2003\u2003(2 \u00d7 76 = 152)\nThe total \u201cconceded\u201d value from my perspective is 76 + 84 + 78 + 62 + 152 = 452. Then I \u201ckeep\u201d (total minus what I give to player\u00a02) the following:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 1: 4 \u2013 1 = 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 76 = 228  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 2: 6 \u2013 6 = 0 units \u2192 0  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 3: 3 \u2013 3 = 0 units \u2192 0  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 4: 8 \u2013 1 = 7 units \u2192 7 \u00d7 62 = 434  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 5: 4 \u2013 2 = 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 76 = 152  \nSo my retained value = 228 + 0 + 0 + 434 + 152 = 814, which is above my outside offer guarantee of 803.\n\nThis offer leaves player\u00a02 with a \u201chigh\u2010quantity\u201d bundle of items 2 and 3 (which I value low but which\u2014given player\u00a02\u2019s unknown values\u2014could be quite attractive) along with a modest quantity (1 or 2 units) of the high\u2013value items 1, 4, and 5. Overall, by my valuation the package I keep is 814 (a slight improvement over my disagreement payoff) while player\u00a02 gets a bundle that by expected standards (given uniform draws on values from 1 to 101) should be competitive with their outside option.\n\nTherefore my initial counteroffer is to give player\u00a02 the following division: [1, 6, 3, 1, 2].\n\nThus my JSON action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 6, 3, 1, 2]}",

In contrast, items 2, 3, and 5 have lower values for me (14, 69, and 43 respectively), so I can more generously offer those to Player 2.\n\n2. One idea was to \u201csplit\u201d fairly, but I can do better by offering Player 2 mostly the items that cost me less while keeping the highest\u2010valued ones. Since Player 2\u2019s own private valuations are unknown (but on average they might value a unit around 51), they would expect an outside offer averaging on the order of 660\u2013670 if they got all items. In a one\u2011round deal there is no discount, so if I want them to choose the deal immediately, I must offer them a bundle whose expected value is competitive with what they might get on their own.\n\n3. I consider giving away all of item 2 (8 units) because it\u2019s the lowest for me (14 each). I then need to add a bit more. By also offering all units of items 3 and 5 (3 units each), I give Player 2 a bundle that (if they roughly value each unit around 51) would be expected to be worth:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 8\u00d751 \u2248 408\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 3\u00d751 \u2248 153\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 3\u00d751 \u2248 153\n\u2003\u2003Total \u2248 408+153+153 = 714\u2003\nThis bundle should be above what they might expect to get if they waited (noting the discount factor in later rounds) and is attractive for immediate agreement.\n\n4.

As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Step 1: We note the available items:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 4 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 4 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 7 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 4 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 4 units\n\nStep 2: My private per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 61\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 65\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 26\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 64\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 95\n\nThus if I were to keep all items my total value would be:\n\u2003Item 1: 4\u00d761 = 244\n\u2003Item 2: 4\u00d765 = 260\n\u2003Item 3: 7\u00d726 = 182\n\u2003Item 4: 4\u00d764 = 256\n\u2003Item 5: 4\u00d795 = 380\n\u2003Total = 244+260+182+256+380 = 1322\n\nStep 3: My outside offer is 132. So any deal I accept must yield me more than 132 (even after discount, but in round 1 discount factor is \u03b3^(0)=1).\n\nStep 4: In designing an initial offer, I want to keep as many of my \u201chigh\u2010value\u201d items as possible.\n\u2013 Items 1, 2, 4, and 5 are especially valuable (all above 60 per unit).\n\u2013 Item 3 is relatively low valued (26 per unit). \n\nA common tactic is to \u201cload\u201d the low\u2010value item on the opponent. Offering most or all of item 3 to Player 2 is attractive from my perspective since it costs me little.\n\nStep 5: A very aggressive offer might be to give the opponent everything in item 3 (all 7 units) and nothing else. However, I also want to \u201csweeten\u201d the deal a little by giving a little of one of the higher\u2010value items to increase the chance the opponent sees the deal as better than their outside option. Since item 1 is slightly lower (61 per unit) compared to item 5 (95 per unit), I choose to sacrifice 1 unit of item 1 rather than any from the most valuable ones.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, I propose giving Player 2:\n\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 1 (out of 4),\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 2 (out of 4),\n\u2003\u2022 all 7 units of item 3 (out of 7),\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 4 (out of 4),\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 5 (out of 4).\n\nStep 7: My retained shares would then be:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 4 \u2212 1 = 3 units \u2192 value = 3\u00d761 = 183\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 4 \u2212 0 = 4 units \u2192 value = 4\u00d765 = 260\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 7 \u2212 7 = 0 units \u2192 value = 0\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 4 \u2212 0 = 4 units \u2192 value = 4\u00d764 = 256\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 4 \u2212 0 = 4 units \u2192 value = 4\u00d795 = 380\n\u2003Total value = 183+260+256+380 = 1079, which is far above my outside offer of 132.\n\nStep 8: The opponent\u2019s offer consists of 1 unit of item 1 and all of item 3 (7 units). Although we do not know their private values, giving them all of item 3 plus a small extra in item 1 might be sufficiently attractive compared to their outside offer.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I now propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 7, 0, 0]}",

Thus, if I propose a division (by offering Player 2 some items) I want my own \u201ckept\u201d bundle to be worth at least 529 (and ideally only slightly above so that I maximize my share while giving just enough to be attractive for Player 2).\n\nI can control the division by offering a list [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5] where each n is the units given to Player 2 of that item. My own share per item is (total available \u2013 offered units). My total value will then be:\n\n\u2003\u2003Value = 7\u00d7(2 \u2013 n1) + 79\u00d7(2 \u2013 n2) + 58\u00d7(2 \u2013 n3) + 52\u00d7(3 \u2013 n4) + 54\u00d7(4 \u2013 n5).\n\nA good strategic plan is to \u201cconcede\u201d those items I value less and keep items I value highly so that my own share\u2019s total value is just above 529. Among the items, Item 1 is very low (7/unit) so I want to give it away completely. Also, I can \u201csacrifice\u201d the entire allotment of a moderately valued item such as Item 3 (58/unit) in order to provide something attractive to Player 2. In contrast, I want to keep all of Item 2 (79/unit), Item 4 (52/unit) and Item 5 (54/unit).\n\nLet\u2019s check that division explicitly:\n\u2003\u2022 Offer to Player 2 all of Item 1: offer n1 = 2  \n\u2003\u2022 Offer none of Item 2: n2 = 0  \n\u2003\u2022 Offer all of Item 3: n3 = 2  \n\u2003\u2022 Offer none of Item 4: n4 = 0  \n\u2003\u2022 Offer none of Item 5: n5 = 0\n\nThen my retained units become:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 0 units  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 2 units  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0 units  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3 units  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 4 units\n\nComputing my total value:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 0\u00d77 = 0  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 2\u00d779 = 158  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0\u00d758 = 0  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3\u00d752 = 156  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 4\u00d754 = 216  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 158 + 156 + 216 = 530\n\nThis gives me a total value of 530 \u2013 just 1 point above my outside offer of 529. (Getting even a slight improvement is worthwhile.) Also, by giving all units of Item 1 (which I value very little) and all units of Item 3, I provide Player 2 a solid bundle that might be worthwhile relative to their outside option. (Their private values are unknown, but this may be attractive.) \n\nThus, I propose my initial offer as: give Player 2: [2, 0, 2, 0, 0]. This is a valid counteroffer meeting my own reservation (530 > 529) while keeping as many high\u2013value (for me) items.\n\nSo my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 0, 0]}",

This is far below my outside offer of 532.\n\nI want any deal to deliver a present\u2010value of at least 532. In round 2 the deal\u2019s raw total is \u201cdiscounted\u201d by 0.9 so I need a raw value of at least about 532/0.9 \u2248 591. Thus I want to \u201ckeep\u201d items for myself that sum (using my private values) to at least about 592.\n\nI value the items as follows:\n\u2003item 1: 57 (5 units available)\n\u2003item 2: 21 (4 units)\n\u2003item 3: 63 (3 units)\n\u2003item 4: 22 (1 unit)\n\u2003item 5: 14 (7 units)\n\nBecause items 1, 3, and 4 are very valuable to me, I want to secure all of them. Their total is:\n\u20035\u00d757 + 3\u00d763 + 1\u00d722 = 285 + 189 + 22 = 496.\n\nThat leaves items 2 and 5 to \u201cbargain\u201d over. I must \u201ckeep\u201d enough of 2 and/or 5 so that my additional value is at least 96 (since 496 + 96 = 592). One way to just clear the threshold is to concede all of item 2 (since 4\u00d721 = 84 is not enough) and then keep 1 unit of item 5 (1\u00d714 = 14) so that my extra value is 84+14 = 98. Then my overall raw value is 496+98 = 594 \u2013 just a bit over the threshold. When discounted by 0.9 that gives 594\u00d70.9 = 534.6, which is marginally above my outside offer of 532.\n\nIn order to do that my \u201callocation\u201d (what I end up with) would be:\n\u2003item 1: all 5 units\n\u2003item 2: 0 units (since I give all 4 to the other party)\n\u2003item 3: all 3 units\n\u2003item 4: the 1 unit\n\u2003item 5: 1 unit (keep 1, give the other 7\u20131 = 6)\n\nSince in any counteroffer I state what I \u201cgive\u201d to my opponent, I must offer them:\n\u2003item 1: 0\n\u2003item 2: 4 (all of it)\n\u2003item 3: 0\n\u2003item 4: 0\n\u2003item 5: 6\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a bundle with raw value 594 and a discounted value 534.6\u2014just above my fallback of 532.

A good option is to keep all of my items that are most valuable (items 1 and 2) and concede my \u201ccheaper\u201d items.

One natural idea is to give a unit of an item that has a relatively high value for Player 1 (and even though it costs me something, I can still remain above my threshold). For me, a single unit of item 5 is worth 60. If I offer Player 1 1 unit of item 5, then my retained bundle is: \n\n\u2022 Item 1: 5  \n\u2022 Item 2: 4  \n\u2022 Item 3: 2  \n\u2022 Item 4: 6  \n\u2022 Item 5: 5 \u2212 1 = 4  \n\nMy retained value becomes:\n  \n\u2022 Item 1: 5\u00d720 = 100  \n\u2022 Item 2: 4\u00d735 = 140  \n\u2022 Item 3: 2\u00d762 = 124  \n\u2022 Item 4: 6\u00d713 = 78  \n\u2022 Item 5: 4\u00d760 = 240  \n\nTotal = 100 + 140 + 124 + 78 + 240 = 682\n\nThis overall value (682) is above my outside offer of 622. Thus, my counteroffer yields me a superior outcome if a deal is reached, while giving Player 1 a potential incentive (they get 1 unit of item 5).\n\nThus, I propose the following counteroffer, meaning I am offering Player 1 exactly 1 unit of item 5 (and nothing from the other items):\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

                    "response": "After analyzing the situation, here is my reasoning:\n\n\u2022 In the current offer from Player 1 (giving me [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]) I would receive 2 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5. With my private per\u2010unit values (item 4 = 13 and item 5 = 60), that gives me a total raw value of 2\u00d713 + 2\u00d760 = 26 + 120 = 146. With a discount factor of 0.9 in round 2 the present value is 0.9\u00d7146 = 131.4, which is far below my guaranteed outside offer of 622.\n\n\u2022 If I try a counteroffer, I must make sure that my negotiated deal (after discounting) has a raw value of at least 622/0.9 \u2248 691 in order to beat my outside option. Since my total maximum raw value if I got everything is 742, I could in theory afford to give up at most 742 \u2013 691 \u2248 51 \u201cpoints\u201d of value. However, because of my own value weights the \u201ccost\u201d for me per unit is: 20 for item1, 35 for item2, 62 for item3, 13 for item4, and 60 for item5. This means that even giving up a single unit of items 3 or 5 (which are very valuable to me) already costs more than 51. Thus any counteroffer intended to keep my deal better than 622 must give up only items where the cost is low\u2014in this case maybe items 1, 2 or especially 4. \n\n\u2022 To entice Player 1 to accept my counteroffer they should receive a bundle that is at least as attractive as what they have already proposed. In the current offer the allocation (from my perspective) is that Player 1 would get all of item 1 (5 units), item 2 (4), item 3 (2), plus 6 \u2013 2 = 4 units of item 4 and 5 \u2013 2 = 3 units of item 5. It would be extremely difficult for me to give up nearly that many items (or even parts of the ones I value modestly) without sacrificing so much of my own raw value that my share would drop below the threshold needed (about 691 raw value, i.e. 0.9\u00d7raw \u2265622).\n\n\u2022 Given that any counteroffer which gives Player 1 a sufficiently attractive share would force me to give up items \u201cworth\u201d in excess of 51 points from my side\u2014thus lowering my own total below the breakeven value\u2014and that the current offer gives me a very poor outcome (131.4 vs. 622), my best option is to WALK away and secure my outside offer of 622.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

For each item i, your allocation would be (total_i \u2013 offer_i) and you value that at your unit values:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Total items: [1, 6, 1, 4, 3]\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Your values: [81, 43, 96, 29, 61]\n\n3. You especially want to keep items that are highly valued by you (item 1 at 81 and item 3 at 96) and also item 5 at 61. Items 2 and 4 are less valuable per unit.\n\n4. A promising counteroffer is to propose giving Player 2 only a portion of items 2 and 4 so that you keep more of the overall high value. For example, if you offer:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 1: give 0 units \u2192 you keep 1 unit (worth 81)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 2: give 5 units \u2192 you keep 1 unit (worth 43)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 3: give 0 units \u2192 you keep 1 unit (worth 96)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 4: give 3 units \u2192 you keep 1 unit (worth 29)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 5: give 0 units \u2192 you keep all 3 units (worth 3\u00d761 = 183)\n\u2003\u2003Then your allocation becomes [1,1,1,1,3] with total undiscounted value = 81+43+96+29+183 = 432.\n\u2003\u2003Discounting by 0.9 in round 2 gives 432\u00d70.9 = 388.8, which is more advantageous than the current offer.\n\n5.

However, Player\u202f2\u2019s decision will hinge on whether the value they receive (with an uncertain private value per unit drawn uniformly from 1 to 101) is at least as attractive as their own (unknown) outside option.\n\nI exploit the fact that I value item\u202f1 very little (13 per unit) while\u2014on average\u2014a typical opponent might value it around 51 (since 51 is the mean of 1 to 101).

So it makes sense for me to \u201cconcede\u201d more of item\u202f1 and give only token quantities of other items so that I can keep more of the high\u2010value ones for myself.\n\nOne simple division is to give Player\u202f2 the following:\n\u2003Item\u202f1: 4 units (out of 7)\n\u2003Item\u202f2: 1 unit (all available)\n\u2003Item\u202f3: 1 unit (out of 3)\n\u2003Item\u202f4: 2 units (out of 5)\n\u2003Item\u202f5: 1 unit (out of 2)\n\nThen I would keep:\n\u2003Item\u202f1: 3 units\u2003\u20033 \u00d7 13 = 39\n\u2003Item\u202f2: 0 units\u2003\u20030 \u00d7 49 = 0\n\u2003Item\u202f3: 2 units\u2003\u20032 \u00d7 44 = 88\n\u2003Item\u202f4: 3 units\u2003\u20033 \u00d7 73 = 219\n\u2003Item\u202f5: 1 unit\u2003\u20031 \u00d7 93 = 93\n\u2003\u2003Total value for me = 39 + 0 + 88 + 219 + 93 = 439\n\nThis 439 is well above 145, so my outcome is excellent if the deal is struck. On Player\u202f2\u2019s side, if we assume (on average) their per\u2010unit values are around 51, their offer would be worth roughly:\n\u2003Item\u202f1: 4 \u00d7 51 = 204\n\u2003Item\u202f2: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n\u2003Item\u202f3: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n\u2003Item\u202f4: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n\u2003Item\u202f5: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n\u2003\u2003Total \u2248 204 + 51 + 51 + 102 + 51 = 459\n\nThat level (\u2248459) is in the reasonable ballpark of what we expect their outside offer might be (and possibly a bit higher given risk or discount factors in later rounds).

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 562. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 588 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Given that trying to counteroffer could risk discounting or losing the guaranteed value and I already secure 486 by accepting, the best action is to accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",
