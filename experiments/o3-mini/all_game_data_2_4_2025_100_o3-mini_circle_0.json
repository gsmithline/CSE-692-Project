(Thus our total full value would be 424.) Our outside option guarantees us 71, so any deal we accept should give us more than that. Because we are the first proposer (round 1, with no discount yet), we want to propose a division that gives us as high a share as possible while offering the other side just enough to get an offer they would accept instead of relying on their outside option. Even though we don\u2019t know Player 2\u2019s exact values, their per\u2010unit values are uniformly drawn from 1 to 101 so the averages are around 51 per unit. In designing our offer we want to use items that are less important to us (those with lower private value) to \u201cbribe\u201d Player 2. For us, item 3 is the lowest (16 per unit) and item 1 (18 per unit) is next lowest compared to our other items. In contrast, we particularly value items like item 5 (26 each) and also value significant parts of item 2 and 4 (each 19)\u2014so we\u2019d like to keep most of them.\n\nA plausible strategy is to offer Player 2 only a minimal share that would give them an expected value not far below the average outside offer (which we know is 71 for us, though their actual outside offer is unknown, it\u2019s reasonable to assume they\u2019d require an offer above that). By offering them 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 3 (i.e. a counteroffer of [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]), Player 2 would receive 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 3. The expected value of these two units (with average ~51 per unit) would be around 102 in expectation\u2014comfortably above 71 on average. Meanwhile, we get the remainder: [1, 4, 4, 4, 6] which gives us a utility of 1*18 + 4*19 + 4*16 + 4*19 + 6*26 = 18 + 76 + 64 + 76 + 156 = 390, a strong result. \n\nThus, my final decision is to propose the counteroffer: \n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}",

Although I don\u2019t know Player\u00a02\u2019s exact private values, on average their value per unit is around 51 (by the uniform draw on 1 to 101), so I expect that giving them all 11 units of item\u00a04 will be attractive compared to their outside alternative. This offer gives them an expected sum (11 \u00d7 an average around 51, i.e. about 561) that should be above their disagreement payoff, while I retain almost everything else (all of items 1, 2, 3, and 5) for a total value of 667 by my numbers.

                    "response": "I'll analyze the situation as follows.\n\nCurrently Player 1\u2019s offer would give me: 0 of item1, 1 of item2, 0 of item3, 0 of item4, 0 of item5. With my values (85, 49, 37, 9, 98), that makes 0\u00b785 + 1\u00b749 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 49 \u2013 far below both what I could get if I won all items (total value 1417) and even below my outside offer of 755.\n\nSo I need to propose a counteroffer that leaves me with at least more than 755 in my payoff when I get my share. Note that if I propose an offer where I give Player 1 a bundle (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5) then I would keep the remainder: [9 \u2013 x1, 4 \u2013 x2, 1 \u2013 x3, 3 \u2013 x4, 4 \u2013 x5]. My total value would be\n\n\u2003\u20031417 \u2013 (85\u00b7x1 + 49\u00b7x2 + 37\u00b7x3 + 9\u00b7x4 + 98\u00b7x5).\n\nTo secure more than 755 for myself I need to keep at least 756 value for myself. At the same time I want the offer to be appealing enough to Player 1 for them to accept rather than play on (especially since future rounds discount the total value).\n\nOne natural approach is to try to keep most of the items that I value very highly (item1 and item5; worth 85 and 98 per unit) and offer some share of those \u201cgood\u201d items to Player 1 along with all of the items I value less (items 2, 3, and 4). For example, if I were to simply take all of item1 and item5 then I\u2019d get 9\u00b785 + 4\u00b798 = 765 + 392 = 1157 \u2013 which is clearly above my outside offer \u2013 but Player 1 would get only items I consider low value. To increase the likelihood they find the deal attractive, I can offer them a slice of item1 as well.\n\nA balanced proposal is to give Player 1:\n\u2003\u2022 3 units of item 1,\n\u2003\u2022 all of item 2 (4 units),\n\u2003\u2022 the single unit of item 3,\n\u2003\u2022 all of item 4 (3 units), and\n\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 5.\nThat means my counteroffer to Player 1 would be [3, 4, 1, 3, 1]. Then I would receive the remainder:\n\u2003\u2022 item 1: 9 \u2013 3 = 6 units,\n\u2003\u2022 item 2: 4 \u2013 4 = 0,\n\u2003\u2022 item 3: 1 \u2013 1 = 0,\n\u2003\u2022 item 4: 3 \u2013 3 = 0,\n\u2003\u2022 item 5: 4 \u2013 1 = 3.\nMy total value would then be 6\u00b785 + 3\u00b798 = 510 + 294 = 804, which is comfortably above my outside offer of 755. In my measure, Player 1 gets \u201cworth\u201d 3\u00b785 + 4\u00b749 + 1\u00b737 + 3\u00b79 + 1\u00b798 = 255 + 196 + 37 + 27 + 98 = 613\u2014providing them with a decent share of the items and hopefully an incentive to agree rather than walking away for an uncertain outside offer.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 1, 3, 1]}",

                    "response": "My analysis begins by comparing the value you\u2019d get if you accepted the current offer. Accepting [3, 2, 0, 2, 3] would grant you:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 72 = 216\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 94 = 188\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 64 = 0\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 6 = 12\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 92 = 276\n\u2003\u2003Total = 216 + 188 + 0 + 12 + 276 = 692\n\nBecause this is round 1 (discount factor 1.0) and your outside offer is 264, 692 is much better; however, you can improve your position by making a counteroffer.\n\nYou know your own values and note that you have a strong advantage on items 1, 2, 3, and 5 relative to a typical (average) opponent (whose values are around 51 on average). In contrast, you value item 4 very little (6 per unit), so you are happy to concede all of it. The current division (from Player\u202f1\u2019s offer) gives Player\u202f1 the complementary bundle:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 3 units (since total is 6)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 4 units (total 6)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 4 units (total 4)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3 units (total 5)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 3 units (total 6)\nThis yields about 17 units. In expected terms (using a rough average of 51 per unit) that\u2019s around 867 \u201cpoints\u201d for them.\n\nYour goal is to improve your own score while leaving the opponent with roughly the same overall \u201csize\u201d of bundle, just shifting the mix to give them more of the low\u2010value (to you) item 4 and less of the high\u2010value ones. One natural idea is to \u201csqueeze\u201d a bit by offering them fewer units of items 1, 2, and 5 (which you value highly) and compensate by giving them more units of item 4 (which you value very little). For example, if you offer them:\n\u2003Item 1: 2 units (down from 3)\n\u2003Item 2: 3 units (down from 4)\n\u2003Item 3: 4 units (keeping it as is)\n\u2003Item 4: 5 units (raising from 3 \u2013 and all of it, since total is 5)\n\u2003Item 5: 3 units (same)\nthen their bundle would be [2, 3, 4, 5, 3]. (This is feasible because the totals per item remain within the max available: 2 \u22646, 3 \u22646, 4 =4, 5 =5, 3 \u22646.) Under this counteroffer your share becomes the remaining units:\n\u2003Item 1: 6\u20132 = 4\n\u2003Item 2: 6\u20133 = 3\n\u2003Item 3: 4\u20134 = 0\n\u2003Item 4: 5\u20135 = 0\n\u2003Item 5: 6\u20133 = 3\nYour resulting utility is:\n\u2003Item 1: 4\u00d772 = 288\n\u2003Item 2: 3\u00d794 = 282\n\u2003Item 3: 0\u00d764 = 0\n\u2003Item 4: 0\u00d76 = 0\n\u2003Item 5: 3\u00d792 = 276\n\u2003\u2003Total = 288 + 282 + 276 = 846, which is a substantial improvement over 692.\n\nFor Player 1 the offered bundle is rearranged from the current split. In a simplified analysis (using an average value of about 51 per unit), the total number of units they would get is still 2+3+4+5+3 = 17, very similar to the current split. (In items where you reduce their share, you \u201cmake up\u201d by handing over extra of item 4 that they might value more than you do.) Thus, the counteroffer is designed to be just as attractive to them while boosting your own outcome.\n\nBased on this, my chosen action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 4, 5, 3]}",

My total value for all items is 1092. My external fallback (outside offer) is worth 494.\n2. Since it is round 1 (with no offer on the table) and the discount factor is 0.9 per extra round, we want to secure an agreement early that nets me better than the 494 fallback.\n3. I also know that my highest\u2010value items are items 3 and 5 (with values 93 and 67 respectively) so I wish to retain most of them. Meanwhile, I can be more flexible on items for which my own value is relatively lower (e.g. items 1, 2, and 4) so that I offer Player 2 enough value so that they prefer a deal now rather than risk a discounted outcome later.\n4. An initial offer that does this is to propose splitting the \u201clow\u2010value\u201d items almost evenly (for example, offering half the total of items 1, 2 and 4 to Player 2) while keeping most of the \u201chigh\u2010value\u201d items (items 3 and most of item 5) for myself.\n5. One such offer is: offer Player 2 2 units of item 1 (out of 4), 3 of item 2 (out of 6), none of item 3 (keeping both units), 1 of item 4 (out of 2), and 1 of item 5 (out of 4). Under this division I keep:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 4 \u2013 2 = 2 units (2\u00d745 = 90)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 6 \u2013 3 = 3 units (3\u00d759 = 177)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2 \u2013 0 = 2 units (2\u00d793 = 186)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 2 \u2013 1 = 1 unit (1\u00d752 = 52)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 4 \u2013 1 = 3 units (3\u00d767 = 201)\n\u2003\u2003Totaling 90+177+186+52+201 = 706,\nwhich is well above my fallback 494. Meanwhile, Player 2\u2019s allocation (the offer) gives them some \u201cwinning\u201d share on several items.\n6. This distribution seems a reasonable initial offer, balancing my interest (keeping high\u2010value items) with leaving enough value to Player 2 so that they might accept (or at least not immediately walk away).\n\nThus, my action is to make this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 0, 1, 1]}",

Because we are in round 2 the deal is discounted by 0.9, so its present\u2010value becomes 281\u00d70.9 = 252.9. This is below our outside offer of 283, so accepting is unattractive.\n\n\u2022 In earlier rounds we had proposed [2, 3, 2, 0, 1] (which would have given us the complement [2, 2, 4, 1, 0]). That deal, had it been accepted, would have netted us 2\u00d711 + 2\u00d717 + 4\u00d790 + 1\u00d716 + 0\u00d739 = 22 + 34 + 360 + 16 = 432 raw points\u2014far above our reservation. However, Player 2 did not go with that proposal.\n\n\u2022 In round 2 we want our deal (when discounted by 0.9) to be at least as good as walking away for 283. That requires our raw valuation to be at least about 283/0.9 \u2248 314, and ideally somewhat higher.\n\n\u2022 One way to \u201cbuy\u201d the acceptance of Player 2 is to offer them a division that gives up enough value so that our share is close to (but above) our minimum acceptable raw value. In our view, the total value available is 724. If we target a raw value for ourselves of about 320 (because 320\u00d70.9 = 288, slightly above our outside offer of 283), then we must \u201cgive\u201d to Player 2 a bundle worth 724 \u2212 320 = 404 in our valuation.\n\n\u2022 Our items have different values to us so we can \u201cspend\u201d value by giving units that we value less relative to the items the opponent might prize. For example, item 3 is very valuable for us at 90 each, so giving more of item 3 raises the \u201cprice\u201d we pay in our own value. To reach 404 exactly we can choose a combination that uses a heavy \u201ccost\u201d item so that the opponent\u2019s bundle appears attractive.\n  \n\u2022 A candidate is to offer Player 2: 1 unit of item1 (11), 1 unit of item2 (17), 4 units of item3 (4\u00d790 = 360), 1 unit of item4 (16), and 0 units of item5. The total \u201ccost\u201d for us is 11+17+360+16+0 = 404, leaving us with a share worth 724 \u2212 404 = 320 raw. Discounting 320 by 0.9 gives 288, which is above our reservation of 283.\n  \n\u2022 In this counteroffer Player 2 receives [1, 1, 4, 1, 0]. It is our hope that giving them 4 units of item3 (a high\u2010value item in most cases) along with a share of a scarce item (item4) will help swing acceptance.\n\nThus, I propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 4, 1, 0]}",

I first looked at my private values: I highly value item3 (59 per unit) and item5 (47 per unit), moderately value item2 (42 per unit), and have relatively low interest in items 1 (11 per unit) and 4 (4 per unit). To maximize my own outcome while still leaving a \u201cgood\u2010enough\u201d offer for the other player, I want to keep my high\u2010value items (items 3 and 5) as well as most of item2.\n2. Since I have no direct information about Player 2\u2019s exact values (they are drawn from a uniform distribution), I want to offer them the items that I value the least. Thus, it makes sense to give them all of item1 (5 units) and all of item4 (8 units).\n3. By doing so I keep items 2, 3, and 5 entirely. In my own evaluation that gives me:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item2: all 6 units (6\u00d742 = 252)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item3: all 2 units (2\u00d759 = 118)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item5: the single unit (1\u00d747 = 47)\n\u2003\u2003for a total of 252+118+47 = 417, which is well above my outside offer of 118.\n4. Meanwhile Player 2 receives 5+8 = 13 total units. Although I do not know their exact item values, offering them the items I regard as least valuable to me may be attractive enough relative to their own outside option (even accounting for discounting in later rounds).\n5. Given that this is round 1 (no discount yet), it is strategically sound to anchor with a relatively strong offer that maximizes my own share while conceding the items that I do not want.\n\nThus, my initial offer is to give Player 2 all units of item1 and item4 while keeping the rest for myself.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 0, 8, 0]}",

In a counteroffer I must secure at least an effective value above 604. Since my total raw value is 929, I need at least roughly 671 raw points (since 671\u00d70.9\u2248604). By proposing that Player 2 receive [4,0,1,2,1] (i.e. giving up items 1, 3, 4, and one unit of 5) I retain the complement [0,5,4,0,1] which gives me a raw value of 5\u00d780 + 4\u00d765 + 1\u00d744 = 400 + 260 + 44 = 704 (and 704\u00d70.9\u2248633.6 discounted), which is safely above my outside offer.

                    "response": "My current offer from Player 1 would give me an outcome of only a value of 60 (since I\u2019d receive 0 of item\u202f1, 2 of item\u202f2, and nothing else), which is far below my guaranteed outside option of 596. In order to get a deal that makes it worthwhile to me, I need to insist on receiving items whose total worth (using my private values) is well above 596. At the same time, I must leave enough for Player\u202f1 so that they prefer the deal over their own outside offer\u2014even though their exact numbers are unknown, fairness can often be a good starting point early on.\n\nOne natural way to \u201csplit the pie\u201d (worth 1290 to me if I got everything) is to aim for something resembling a 50\u201350 division of the total value. With 5 types of items available in these amounts:\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f1: 5 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f2: 4 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f3: 5 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f4: 5 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f5: 4 units\n\nA simple \u201cfair split\u201d would be to give Player\u202f1 about half the units of each item where possible. For instance, if I offer Player\u202f1:\n\u2003item\u202f1: 2 units\u2003(from 5, I keep 3),\n\u2003item\u202f2: 2 units\u2003(from 4, I keep 2),\n\u2003item\u202f3: 2 units\u2003(from 5, I keep 3),\n\u2003item\u202f4: 2 units\u2003(from 5, I keep 3), and\n\u2003item\u202f5: 2 units\u2003(from 4, I keep 2).\n\nThen my allocation would be:\n\u2003item\u202f1: 3 units\u2003\u2192\u20033 \u00d7 96 = 288,\n\u2003item\u202f2: 2 units\u2003\u2192\u20032 \u00d7 30 = 60,\n\u2003item\u202f3: 3 units\u2003\u2192\u20033 \u00d7 54 = 162,\n\u2003item\u202f4: 3 units\u2003\u2192\u20033 \u00d7 56 = 168,\n\u2003item\u202f5: 2 units\u2003\u2192\u20032 \u00d7 35 = 70.\nSumming these gives me a total value of 748, which is well above my outside offer of 596. (This means that even after discounting later rounds\u2014with full value in round 1\u2014this deal is attractive for me.) \n\nIt is likely that offering roughly half the pie is more acceptable to Player\u202f1 than a very skewed division. (Even though I might like to keep more, asking for almost everything would probably make them reject the proposal and opt for their reservation value instead.) \n\nThus, my counteroffer is to allocate to Player\u202f1 the following amounts:\n[2, 2, 2, 2, 2].\n\nI now provide my action in the required format.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]}",

In my evaluation my values for the items are very different from the average expected values for Player\u00a02; for instance, I value item\u00a02 relatively low (38 per unit) while on average Player\u00a02 might see about 51 per unit. Thus, by conceding full control of item\u00a02 I \"buy\" Player\u00a02\u2019s agreement with relatively low cost to me while keeping all of the more valuable items for myself. I have also considered that offering even a small portion of item\u00a01 (valued only 11 by me) can further bridge any gap so that Player\u00a02\u2019s payoff is acceptable (since even 1 unit of item\u00a01 would add roughly 51 expected points for them). \n\nBased on these considerations, my initial proposal is to offer Player\u00a02 all of item\u00a02 (4 units) and 1 unit of item\u00a01, while keeping all of the remaining items. This offer (i.e. giving Player\u00a02 the allocation [1, 4, 0, 0, 0]) results in me keeping:\n\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01: 5 units (worth 55 for me),\n\u2022\u2003Item\u00a02: 0 units,\n\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03: 7 units (worth 385),\n\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04: 6 units (worth 432),\n\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05: 1 unit (worth 91),\ntotaling a value of 55 + 385 + 432 + 91 = 1063.\nPlayer\u00a02\u2019s expected \u201clot\u201d (using rough average estimates for their unknown private values) should be competitive relative to their outside offer. \n\nThus, my move in round 1 is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 0, 0, 0]}",

I want to achieve a deal that\u2019s better for me than my outside option of 607 while offering enough to Player\u00a02 so that, based on an (unknown but roughly average) unit value of about 51 per unit, they would see a similar \u201cfair\u2010share\u201d prospect. My own values are very high for items 1 and 4 and moderately high for item 5, so I want to keep items that score high for me while offloading items that I value less (items 2 and 3) as well as part of item\u00a05. In total there are 19 units. An even \u201cfair\u201d split in expected value for Player\u00a02 would be roughly 9\u201310 units (about 9.5 units in expectation, given an average near 51 per unit). I can promise them all of item\u00a02 (4 units) plus the only unit of item\u00a03 (1 unit) and then add 5 units from item\u00a05; that gives Player\u00a02 10 total units (roughly 510 expected value) while leaving for me:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01: 2 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04: all 5 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05: the remaining 2 units (7\u00a0\u2013\u00a05)\nThus my own bundle is worth a lot to me (2\u00d793\u00a0+\u00a05\u00d787\u00a0+\u00a02\u00d763 = 747) and exceeds my outside option.

My private values are very high for items 1 (90), 3 (53) and 4 (59), and relatively low for items 2 (4) and 5 (18).

In other words, I can only concede at most 679 \u2013 602 = 77 points from my full value in this negotiation.\n\nStep 2. My per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 48\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 36\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 77\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 17\n\nI want to concede items that cost me little first. Item 3, with a cost of 3 per unit, is very \u201ccheap\u201d for me. Item 5 is next (17 per unit) and then item 2 (36 per unit). Items 1 and 4 are very valuable to me so I want to keep those.\n\nStep 3. I assign integer concessions (i.e. give whole units to Player 2) so that the reduction in my total value is as close as possible to 77 while not dropping me below my outside offer.\n\nA useful combination found is:\n\u2003\u2022 Concede 2 units of Item 3: cost 2\u00d73 = 6 \n\u2003\u2022 Concede 2 units of Item 5: cost 2\u00d717 = 34 \n\u2003\u2022 Concede 1 unit of Item 2: cost 1\u00d736 = 36 \nTotal cost = 6 + 34 + 36 = 76.\n\nStep 4.

                    "response": "My analysis is as follows. My full value (if I got every unit) is 1142, but my outside offer guarantees 1120. That leaves a surplus of only 22 points available from any negotiated division. In order for a deal to beat my outside offer, I must secure an outcome that gives me at least 1120. Since I get my value from the items I keep (the ones not given to Player 2), any unit I \u201cgive away\u201d loses me its unit value. My values for items 1\u20135 are 57, 73, 92, 18, and 60 respectively. The only unit that costs me relatively little is one unit of item 4 (worth 18); even that is nearly all of my available surplus (22\u201318 = 4 left). And no other item\u2019s unit can be afforded (the next least value is 57, which overshoots my slack).\n\nThis means the only \u201cconcession\u201d I could safely offer (while being assured of a deal better than my outside offer) would be something like giving Player 2 one unit of item 4, leaving me with a total value of 1142 \u2013 18 = 1124. However, from Player 2\u2019s perspective\u2014given that their private values are drawn uniformly between 1 and 101 and that their outside offer is drawn from a range up to their overall total value\u2014it is very likely that receiving just one unit of item 4 (which I estimate would be worth around 51 on average to them) is far below what they might expect from their own outside offer. In short, the surplus available in this negotiation is so tiny that any concession designed to induce Player 2 to accept would require giving up too much for me.\n\nGiven that even a \u201cgenerous\u201d (for Player 2) offer would force me to lose too much value relative to my outside option, it is most rational for me to simply avoid a negotiated deal and take my outside offer of 1120, rather than risk further discounting in later rounds. \n\nThus, my decision is to WALK.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",
