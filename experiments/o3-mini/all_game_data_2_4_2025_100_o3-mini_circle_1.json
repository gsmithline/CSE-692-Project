Our total available items are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 5 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 6 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 6 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 4 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 4 units\n\n2. Our private values are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 80\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 75\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 16\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 62\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 37\nThe total maximum value (if we got every unit) is 1342, but our outside offer guarantees 1075.\n\n3. To earn a deal that beats our outside offer, we must secure a deal worth more than 1075. Since items 1, 2, and 4 are very valuable to us, we want to keep all of those. In fact,\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: Keep all 5 giving 5\u00d780 = 400\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: Keep all 6 giving 6\u00d775 = 450\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: Keep all 4 giving 4\u00d762 = 248\nAdding these yields 400 + 450 + 248 = 1098, which is just above our outside offer.\n\n4. However, if we offer Player 2 all of the lower\u2013valued items it may not be attractive enough for them. To create a margin and improve the attractiveness of our deal, we can concede a small part of one item we value moderately. We choose item 5 (value 37 per unit) because it is less critical than items 1, 2, and 4.\n\n5. One simple division that guarantees us more than 1075 is to keep all of items 1, 2, and 4, but give up some of the lower\u2013valued items:\n\u2003\u2022 Give Player 2 all 6 units of Item 3 (worth 6\u00d716 = 96 to us) \n\u2003\u2022 Give Player 2 3 of the 4 units of Item 5, while we keep 1 unit of Item 5.\nThis yields our own bundle: \n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 5 units, Item 2: 6 units, Item 3: 0 units, Item 4: 4 units, Item 5: 1 unit.\nOur total value is 5\u00d780 + 6\u00d775 + 4\u00d762 + 1\u00d737 = 400 + 450 + 248 + 37 = 1135, which comfortably beats our outside offer.\n\n6. The offer to Player 2 is then to give them:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 0, Item 2: 0, Item 3: 6, Item 4: 0, Item 5: 3.\nThis is a valid offer since it respects the available item totals.\n\nThus, as our initial counteroffer in round 1, I propose:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 6, 0, 3]}",

                    "response": "I first compute the total \u201craw\u201d (undiscounted) value I could get under different splits. My private per\u2010unit values are: item\u202f1:80, item\u202f2:75, item\u202f3:16, item\u202f4:62, and item\u202f5:37. In total the items are worth 1342 to me if I got everything.\n\nIn round\u202f2 the discount factor is 0.9, so if we settle now my \u201cdealt\u2010in\u201d raw value X is worth 0.9\u00b7X. My guaranteed outside offer is 1075 (with no discount) so any settlement must give me more than 1075 in discounted terms.\n\nThe current offer on the table gives me [0,0,6,0,4]. That means:\n\u2022\u2003item\u202f3: 6 units \u2192 6\u00d716 = 96\n\u2022\u2003item\u202f5: 4 units \u2192 4\u00d737 = 148\nfor a total raw value of 244. Discounted that is 0.9\u00d7244 \u2248 220, which is far below my outside offer of 1075.\n\nI then considered trying to counteroffer. To improve my situation I\u2019d like to capture most of the items that are most valuable to me (items\u202f1, 2, and 4) while conceding items I value little (like item\u202f3) to player\u202f2. For example, if I could get all of items\u202f1,2,4 and most of item\u202f5 while giving player\u202f2, say, all of item\u202f3 and a small share of item\u202f5, then my raw value might be over 1200. Discounted (\u00d70.9) that gives about 1088 which is a bit better than 1075. However, player\u202f2\u2019s round\u202f1 offer (which granted them all of item\u202f1,2,4) suggests that they likely prize those items more highly on their own (since their own private values, though unknown to me, are drawn from 1 to 101). In order to induce them to accept a counteroffer, I\u2019d need to \u201cpay\u201d them more by giving up a share of these high\u2010value items. That would sharply reduce my own total and could easily bring my own discounted value to below my outside offer.\n\nGiven the numbers, any counteroffer that gives me a raw value high enough to beat a 1075 outside offer (i.e. raw value more than roughly 1195) requires me to claim nearly all of items\u202f1,2, and 4. But doing so forces me to give player\u202f2 a split that is much less attractive relative to their earlier offer. In other words, while I could try to improve my deal slightly, in this round the best \u201cinside\u201d deal I can hope for is only marginally above 1075\u2014and that narrow margin might induce player\u202f2 to reject in expectation of a better deal later. Moreover, if we fail to reach an agreement this round the process will move closer to expiration (and further discounting), and if player\u202f2 makes a counteroffer in round\u202f3 it would count as a WALK, leaving me with 1075 from my outside offer anyway.\n\nBecause the current offer gives me very little (\u2248220 in discounted value) and any counteroffer I might propose runs the risk of not being accepted\u2014thus forcing me into my alternative of 1075\u2014I conclude that trying to negotiate further is unlikely to improve my final outcome relative to simply taking the outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my best action is to WALK away and secure the outside offer of 1075.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Since the maximum possible value (if I got every item) is 1292, I can only afford to concede up to 1292 \u2013 1213 = about 79 value points (in terms of my own private values).\n\u2022 I want to keep nearly all of the high\u2010value items (item1, item3, and item4 \u2013 whose values are 83, 84, and 98 respectively for me) and only give up parts of the items that are low in my valuation. My value for item2 is only 16 per unit and for item5 it is 24 per unit.\n\u2022 One reasonable plan is to concede 3 units of item2 (3 \u00d7 16 = 48) and 1 unit of item5 (1 \u00d7 24 = 24), for a total \u201closs\u201d of 48 + 24 = 72. This keeps my share at a raw value of 1292 \u2013 72 = 1220; discounted in round 2 that gives 1220 \u00d7 0.9 = 1098, which safely beats my outside offer.\n\u2022 In my counteroffer I would be \u201coffering\u201d to give Player 2 3 units of item2 and 1 unit of item5, keeping for myself the remaining items.

My private per\u2010unit values are very high on items 1 (58), 2 (60), 4 (84) and 5 (98), while item 3 is very low value (5). It makes sense to avoid giving away the items I value most.\n\n\u2022 To start the negotiation, I want an offer that gives Player\u00a02 sufficient \u201cincentive\u201d (so that their expected deal is competitive with their own outside offer) while allowing me to keep a very high-value bundle. I can give them all 4 units of item\u00a03 (which I value so little) and a modest number of units from one of the highest total-count items (item\u00a05) so that they receive some additional \u201ccake\u201d to improve their potential deal value.\n\n\u2022 With the offer [0, 0, 4, 0, 3], Player\u00a02 would get:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 0 of item\u00a01 (total 3 remain with me)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 0 of item\u00a02 (total 4 remain with me)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 all 4 units of item\u00a03 (which, given my low value of 5 per unit, I\u2019m happy to cede)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 0 of item\u00a04 (I keep all 3 units)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 3 units of item\u00a05 (so I keep the remaining 4 of item\u00a05)\n\t\n\u2022 This gives me a bundle that yields a total value of:\n\u2003\u2003item\u00a01: 3\u00d758 = 174,\n\u2003\u2003item\u00a02: 4\u00d760 = 240,\n\u2003\u2003item\u00a04: 3\u00d784 = 252,\n\u2003\u2003item\u00a05: 4\u00d798 = 392,\n\u2003\u2003total = 174 + 240 + 252 + 392 = 1058,\nwhich is well above my outside offer of 484.\n\n\u2022 Meanwhile, Player\u00a02 gets 4 units of item\u00a03 and 3 units of item\u00a05. Even though I do not know their private values, this bundle provides them some items. By including part of item\u00a05 (a moderately large concession from the highest\u2010valued category) along with all of item\u00a03, the offer may be attractive enough to start a serious negotiation.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will make the following initial counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 0, 3]}",

Hence my high\u2010valued items are items 4 and 5, and I want to keep most of those.\n\u2022 At the same time I must give Player 2 enough so that in their eyes (with unknown private values) the deal is at least as attractive as their outside offer.\n\u2022 A reasonable strategy is to concede more of the items that I value less (items 2 and 3) and a modest share of the others so that Player 2 sees benefit.\n\u2022 For example, if I offer Player 2: 2 units of item 1 (giving up a moderate value), all of item 2\u2019s 6 units might be too many so I choose a moderate share (3), similarly 2 units of item 3 (which I value low), 1 unit of item 4 (keeping most of the high\u2010value item) and 3 units of item 5 (again keeping most).\n\u2022 This yields a counteroffer where Player 2 would receive:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 2 (out of 5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 3 (out of 6)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 2 (out of 4)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 1 (out of 4)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 3 (out of 9)\n\u2022 Under this division I keep:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 3, item 2: 3, item 3: 2, item 4: 3, and item 5: 6.\n\u2022 My own value for my share is: 3\u00d731 + 3\u00d715 + 2\u00d74 + 3\u00d784 + 6\u00d798 = 93 + 45 + 8 + 252 + 588 = 986, which is well above my outside offer.\n\u2022 Although I don\u2019t know Player 2\u2019s private values, by giving up a modest share of the higher\u2010valued items while conceding more of the lower\u2010valued ones I try to leave them an incentive (possibly above their outside offer) while maximizing my own outcome.\n\u2022 Therefore, my initial counteroffer is as follows.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2,3,2,1,3]}",

We know our private values (item1=71, item2=22, item3=35, item4=7, item5=85) and that the available quantities are [6, 4, 4, 2, 5]. (Remember that if we offer an allocation \u201cO\u201d (a list [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5]), that means we are giving those quantities of the items to Player\u00a02 and keeping the remaining amounts for ourselves.) Our total \u201cmax\u2010value\u201d (if we kept everything) is 1093, so our deal value when we obtain a division where our share is [6\u2013n1, 4\u2013n2, 4\u2013n3, 2\u2013n4, 5\u2013n5] becomes\n\n\u2003\u2003Value = 71*(6\u2013n1) + 22*(4\u2013n2) + 35*(4\u2013n3) + 7*(2\u2013n4) + 85*(5\u2013n5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 = 1093 \u2013 [71*n1 + 22*n2 + 35*n3 + 7*n4 + 85*n5].\n\nWe have an outside offer of 882, so we must ensure any deal we agree to gives us at least that value (ideally, more) given no delay (round 1 discount factor is 1).\n\nBecause our strengths lie in items that have high personal value (notably item1 and item5) and we value items2 and item4 less, a common negotiation tactic is to offer those items fully to Player\u00a02 to \u201cbuy\u201d their acceptance while we keep the items that matter most to us. (Item3 is moderate so we might share it.)\n\nFor example, if we propose giving Player\u00a02 all of item2 (4 units) and item4 (2 units), then we efficiently hand over items that are relatively less valuable to us. To further entice them, we might give a modest share of item3. One candidate division is to offer:\n\u2003\u2003Offer to P2 = [0 units of item1, 4 units of item2, 2 units of item3, 2 units of item4, 0 units of item5].\n\nThen our allocation would be:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 6 \u2013 0 = 6,\n\u2003\u2003Item2: 4 \u2013 4 = 0,\n\u2003\u2003Item3: 4 \u2013 2 = 2,\n\u2003\u2003Item4: 2 \u2013 2 = 0,\n\u2003\u2003Item5: 5 \u2013 0 = 5.\n\nOur resulting value would be:\n\u2003\u20036\u00d771 + 2\u00d735 + 5\u00d785 = 426 + 70 + 425 = 921,\nwhich is above our fallback of 882.\n\nEven though we don\u2019t know Player\u00a02\u2019s private values, giving them a full share of lower\u2010valued items (from our standpoint) and a modest share of a moderate item should help in making the offer acceptable to them (since they must compare it to their outside option). This division is valid, and from our perspective it maximizes our internal value while leaving Player\u00a02 with what might be enough incentive to accept.\n\nThus, my action this round will be to make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 2, 2, 0]}",

As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I'm reasoning as follows:\n\n1. My total value if I took everything is 460, and my outside offer is 456. In a deal, I receive the value of my allocation exactly given by (total value of items I keep). Since the division proposal is expressed by how many items I give to Player 2, my own payoff is the total value of all items (460) minus the loss from giving away items based on my private values.\n\n2. To improve upon my fallback (456), I must guarantee an outcome strictly above 456. This means I can sacrifice at most 4 points in my own value. Looking at my value per unit\u2014\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item1: 17,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item2: 3,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item3: 63,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item4: 19,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item5: 56\u2014\nthe only item where even one unit costs me less than or equal to 4 points is item2 (costs 3 per unit).\n\n3. Thus, if I try to \u201cconcede\u201d by giving away one unit of item2, my own value becomes 460 \u2013 3 = 457, which is barely above my outside offer. However, Player 2\u2019s outside offer is drawn uniformly between 1 and the total value they have for all items. Given the likely high total and the uniform draw, Player 2 would usually expect a reservation value significantly higher than what one unit of item2 (with an average value around 51 from a uniform [1,101] distribution) would provide. In effect, if I give only one unit of item2, it is highly likely that Player 2\u2019s payoff from my offer (\u224851 on average) will not meet their fallback value.\n\n4. Any more generous offer (giving away additional items) would cost me too much; for example, giving away two units of item2 would cost me 6 points, leaving me with only 454 value \u2013 worse than my fallback. Similarly, conceding in any other item would cost too much.\n\n5. Given these constraints, a deal acceptable to Player 2 would force me to sacrifice too much value relative to my strong outside alternative of 456. Hence, it appears that any division that gives Player 2 a realistic chance to accept would reduce my share below my fallback.\n\nIn conclusion, my best strategy at this stage is to WALK away and secure my outside offer of 456 rather than risk proposing an offer that would either be rejected or force me to give away too much value.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

For example, consider the following proposal:\n\u2003\u2022 Give Player\u00a02 all 3 units of item\u00a01\n\u2003\u2022 Give him 3 of the 4 units of item\u00a02 (so I keep 1)\n\u2003\u2022 Give him both units of item\u00a03\n\u2003\u2022 Give him 3 of the 4 units of item\u00a04 (so I keep 1)\n\u2003\u2022 Give him 0 of item\u00a05 (I keep all 5)\n\nMy resulting share is then: [0, 1, 0, 1, 5].

                    "response": "My reasoning:\n1. We start in round 1 with no offer on the table. As Player 1 we must propose an initial division of the items.\n2. The total items available are: \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 3 units \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 6 units \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 6 units \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 7 units \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 3 units\n3. Our private values per unit are high for item 1 (97) and item 5 (41), and comparatively lower for items 2 (35), 3 (28), and 4 (27). This means we prefer to keep a larger number of items 1 and 5 for ourselves.\n4. Our outside offer guarantees 276 value, so any deal we accept must yield us more than that. At the same time, to have the other player accept our deal in round 1 (when there is no discount) we need to leave them an offer that they will likely view as better than their own alternative.\n5. A standard starting point in bargaining problems is a \u201cfair\u2010looking\u201d split that does not leave the other side feeling too shortchanged. Although we lack information on Player 2\u2019s private values, a near\u2013balanced split makes acceptance more likely.\n6. One way to do this is to base our counteroffer on a division that gives player 2 roughly one \u201cunit\u201d of concession in each category that is not overly costly for us. For example, we can offer player 2:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 1 unit of item 1 (so that we keep 2 units of the highest\u2013valued item)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 3 units of item 2 (keeping 3)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 3 units of item 3 (keeping 3)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 3 units of item 4 (keeping 4, since there are 7 in total)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 2)\n7. Under this proposal our own bundle would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2 units \u2192 2\u00d797 = 194\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 3 units \u2192 3\u00d735 = 105 \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3 units \u2192 3\u00d728 = 84 \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 4 units \u2192 4\u00d727 = 108 \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2 units \u2192 2\u00d741 = 82 \n\u2003\u2003Total = 194 + 105 + 84 + 108 + 82 = 573, which is well above our outside offer.\n8. This division leaves Player 2 with:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 3 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 1 unit\nWhile we do not know their exact values, this offer appears reasonably balanced and gives them a significant share in multiple item types.\n9. Therefore, as our initial counteroffer we propose that we give Player 2 the bundle [1, 3, 3, 3, 1] (which represents the number of each item being offered to them).\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 3, 3, 1]}",

Thus I prefer to keep most of item 3 and item 5.\n2. I also have an outside offer of 75 (guaranteed) so any deal must give me considerably more than that. I want to maximize my value, while trying to offer Player\u202f2 just enough so that his deal is at least as attractive relative to his unknown outside offer.\n3. In a first\u2010round move I have a first-mover advantage. I therefore aim for a relatively aggressive division in which I keep most of the high\u2010value goods for me (e.g. items 3, 4, and 5) and concede only a few low\u2013to\u2013moderate valued units (from my perspective) of items where I care the least.\n4. Based on these considerations I propose giving Player\u202f2 only 1 unit of item 1 and 2 units of item 5. Even though I must guess what Player\u202f2\u2019s private values might be, this minimal offer is designed to be just barely above a likely outside alternative without costing me too much.\n5. In this offer, Player\u202f2 receives:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 1 (of 5 available)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 0 (of 2)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0 (of 1)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 0 (of 4)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2 (of 7)\n   I would keep the remaining items for myself. This results in a high personal payoff (e.g. 4 units of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 5 of item 5) while still offering Player\u202f2 a bundle that may be competitive with his outside offer.\n\nThus, my response is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 2]}",

(Recall that his outside offer is unknown to us, but by symmetry it is drawn from a similar pool so it might not be huge relative to the full\u2010surplus value, and his expected per\u2010unit \u201cworth\u201d is roughly in the middle of 1 and 101.) Our goal is then to claim as much of the high\u2010value (\u201cexpensive\u201d) items for ourselves while conceding only a few \u201ccheaper\u201d items to induce acceptance immediately (and so avoid any discount penalty).\n\nOur items (with our values) are:\n\u2003item 1: 7 units, value 40 each\n\u2003item 2: 5 units, value 37 each\n\u2003item 3: 4 units, value 23 each\n\u2003item 4: 3 units, value 24 each\n\u2003item 5: 6 units, value 49 each\n\nIf we took everything we would get 923 in value. However, if our proposal is rejected the game ends (or we would lose time and discounting in later rounds) and our fallback is only 115. Thus we want a deal that gives Player 2 at least roughly 115 in \u201cvalue\u201d when he evaluates the items\u2014without giving away too much of the items we highly prize.\n\nSince items 3 and 4 are the ones with the lowest per\u2010unit value for us (23 and 24, respectively) it makes sense to concede in these categories. In order for Player 2 to \u201cexpect\u201d a deal worth above his outside offer (which we expect to be in the 100\u2013150 range on average), we want him to receive around 3 units in total. Conceding one unit in each of items 3 and 4 gives him 2 units, but that might fall short if his \u201cprivate numbers\u201d are on the lower side; so we add one more unit from item 3 (the cheapest for us).\n\nThus we propose to offer Player 2:\n\u2003item 1: 0 units\n\u2003item 2: 0 units\n\u2003item 3: 2 units\n\u2003item 4: 1 unit\n\u2003item 5: 0 units\n\nIn this case our remaining allocation is:\n\u2003item 1: 7, item 2: 5, item 3: 4\u20132 = 2, item 4: 3\u20131 = 2, item 5: 6\n\nThat gives us a total value of:\n\u20037\u00d740 = 280,\u20035\u00d737 = 185,\u20032\u00d723 = 46,\u20032\u00d724 = 48,\u20036\u00d749 = 294.\n\u2003\u2003Sum = 280 + 185 + 46 + 48 + 294 = 853,\nwhich is far above our fallback of 115, while (given reasonable expectations about Player 2\u2019s numbers) giving him an offer that is likely to clear his own outside benchmark.\n\nThus, my move in round 1 is to offer the following division to Player 2:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]}",

With that in mind, a natural strategy is to propose keeping all of items 1 and 5 and offering the rest (items 2, 3, and 4) to Player 2. Although we do not know Player 2\u2019s private values, giving them all of items 2 (6 units), 3 (3 units) and 4 (1 unit) should still present an attractive offer if their valuations vary.\n3. This division leaves us with [2, 0, 0, 0, 4] and gives us 498 value, which is above our outside offer, while Player 2\u2019s share is [0, 6, 3, 1, 0].\n4.

That means accepting now would be a real loss.\n\nI therefore must counteroffer. In our game a counteroffer is given by a list [n\u2081,n\u2082, \u2026] meaning \u201cI offer you these many units of each item\u201d and I get the remainder (for each item, total available minus what I offer you). My goal is to ensure that (1) my share (the remainder) in my private valuation exceeds 829 (since that\u2019s what I guarantee if I simply WALK), and (2) I leave you (Player 1) with something that \u2013 hopefully \u2013 is acceptable to you given you must compare it to your own outside option. In other words, I\u2019m designing a division that (by my own view) gives me a good value while giving you a possibility of a deal that is not \u201cfree\u2010money\u201d for me.\n\nI have a total of 3,4,3,2,8 units. By offering you [3,3,0,1,2] units, you would get:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 3 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 3 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 1 unit,\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2 units.\nThat leaves me with:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 0 units (3\u20133),\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 1 unit (4\u20133),\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 3 units (3\u20130),\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 1 unit (2\u20131),\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 6 units (8\u20132).\n\nMy value for that allocation is computed as:\n\u2003\u20030\u00b740 + 1\u00b726 + 3\u00b791 + 1\u00b747 + 6\u00b796 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0 + 26 + 273 + 47 + 576 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 922.\nThis is above my fallback value of 829, and so it secures me a better outcome if accepted immediately (and without the delay discount).\n\nWhile I cannot know your private values, I am trying to offer you a nontrivial package that might seem attractive enough compared to your own outside option.

                    "response": "My reasoning:\n\nWe know our private per\u2010unit values are [5, 69, 66, 89, 61] and the total amounts available are [1, 4, 3, 8, 3]. Thus if we took everything we\u2019d get a total raw value of 1374. In round 2 any deal is discounted by 0.9 so if we made a deal giving us raw value X the effective value is 0.9\u00b7X. Also our outside offer gives us 1149 for sure. This means that to improve over our outside option, we need\n\u2003\u20030.9\u00b7(our share\u2019s raw value) > 1149\u2003\u2003or\u2003\u2003our share\u2019s raw value > 1149/0.9 \u2248 1277.\nThus, the maximum concession we can \u201cafford\u201d (i.e. the amount of item value we leave to Player 2) is about 1374 \u2212 1277 = 97 (in our own valuation).\n\nThe current offer on the table would give us [1,3,1,5,1] (utility 784, discounted to about 705.6) which is far below 1149. Therefore we must make a counteroffer in which we claim nearly every valuable unit; in other words, we must \u201ckeep\u201d most of the items so that our own undiscounted value remains at least 1277.\n\nChoosing among possible minimal concessions (each item \u201ccosts\u201d us its per\u2010unit value), we notice that item1 is \u201ccheap\u201d (5 value per unit) and item2 is moderate (69 value per unit). For example, if we offer Player 2 the following:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 all of item1 (1 unit, costing us 5) and\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 one unit of item2 (1 unit, costing us 69),\nthen our total concession is 5 + 69 = 74.\nOur remainder would be:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 0\u2003\u2003(item total 1 \u2212 1)\n\u2003\u2003item2: 3\u2003\u2003(4 \u2212 1)\n\u2003\u2003item3: 3\u2003\u2003(all 3)\n\u2003\u2003item4: 8\u2003\u2003(all 8)\n\u2003\u2003item5: 3\u2003\u2003(all 3)\nThis gives us a raw value of:\n\u2003\u20030\u00b75 + 3\u00b769 + 3\u00b766 + 8\u00b789 + 3\u00b761 = 0 + 207 + 198 + 712 + 183 = 1300.\nDiscounted by 0.9 we get 0.9 \u00d7 1300 = 1170 \u2013 which is just above our outside offer of 1149.\n\nEven though this counteroffer gives Player 2 only two items ([item1, item2] = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]), it is the best we can do to bring our own effective value above our reservation. (Any additional concession would lower our value below the threshold while offering little extra incentive to Player 2.) Therefore, to maximize our outcome we propose to give Player 2 [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nThus my final action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1,1,0,0,0]}.",

My own values are much higher for items 2, 3, and 5 (95, 70, and 77 respectively) than for item 1 (3); so I want to keep all of items 2, 3, and 5 for myself. By contrast, although I do not know Player\u00a02\u2019s exact valuations, all five items are drawn from a similar distribution for them. In expectation their per\u2010unit value is about 51, so giving them the entire stock of items in which I have very little value will likely provide them with a bundle comparable to (or better than) their outside offer. In our case, my fallback (outside offer) is 261, and if we estimate Player\u00a02\u2019s total (expected) is roughly 714, their outside offer is roughly half that (around 357). \n\nThus, if I give Player\u00a02 all 7 units of item\u00a01 (worth about 7\u00d751 \u2248 357 in expectation) and the single unit of item\u00a04 (worth \u224851 in expectation), then on expectation they would receive about 408, which should be attractive compared with their outside option. Meanwhile I keep:\n\u2022 All 3 units of item\u00a02 (3\u00d795 = 285)\n\u2022 All 2 units of item\u00a03 (2\u00d770 = 140)\n\u2022 All 1 unit of item\u00a05 (1\u00d777 = 77)\n\nThat gives me a total value of 285+140+77 = 502, which far exceeds my fallback value of 261. (Also note that we are still in round 1, so the full value is realized with no discount.) \n\nThis division is \u201crisky\u201d from my point of view only if Player\u00a02 happens to have an unusually low value for items 1 or 4 relative to their outside offer, but given the random draws and that players\u2019 outside values are drawn from the total value range, the offer should seem fair to Player\u00a02. \n\nThus my initial offer as Player\u00a01 is to give Player\u00a02 all of item\u00a01 (7 units) and item\u00a04 (1 unit), and I keep the rest.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [7, 0, 0, 1, 0]}",

For example, if I offer to give Player\u00a01 all of items 2 and 5\u2014that is, make the counteroffer:\n\u2003\u2003[0, 3, 0, 0, 3]\nthen my share is exactly:\n\u2003\u2003[3, 0, 0, 3, 0].\n\nMy nominal value becomes:\n\u2003\u20033\u00d763 + 3\u00d787 = 189 + 261 = 450,\nwhich, after discounting (0.9\u00d7450 = 405) beats my outside offer of 402 by a small margin.\nThis counteroffer \u201csqueezes\u201d the deal to my narrow benefit while leaving less\u2010valued items to Player\u00a01. (Player\u00a01\u2019s own offers in earlier rounds\u2014especially giving away item 1 or item 4\u2014suggest he might accept getting full amounts of items 2 and 5 instead.)\n\nThus, I will make the counteroffer [0, 3, 0, 0, 3].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 3]}",

In any deal the raw value I \u201cearn\u201d from my items will be multiplied by 0.81. That means I need to secure raw value V for my items so that 0.81\u00b7V > 392, i.e. V must be at least about 484. (Since 392/0.81 \u2248 484.) If I took everything I\u2019d get 561; so the maximum \u201cconcession\u201d I can afford to give Player\u00a02 (measured in my own per\u2010unit item values) is 561 \u2013 484 \u2248 77 (points).\n\nThe current offer on the table would give me items [0, 3, 0, 0, 3] for a raw value of 3\u00b790 + 3\u00b743 = 270 + 129 = 399 \u2013 far below the 484 needed.\n\nThus I want to propose a counteroffer in which I \u201cgive\u201d Player\u00a02 only items that cost me no more than 77 raw points. Because my own values are lowest for item\u00a01 (11 per unit), a natural idea is to let Player\u00a02 have all units of item\u00a01. That gives 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 points. I then have about 77 \u2013 33 = 44 raw points \u201cbudget\u201d left for a concession; neither item\u00a02 (90) nor items\u00a04 or 5 (43 each) are cheap, so I can only give one extra unit of either a 43\u2010point item. Choosing which of item\u00a04 or item\u00a05 to give can be guided by Player\u00a02\u2019s earlier behavior. In both rounds, they offered me [0, 3, 0, 0, 3] \u2013 meaning they kept item\u00a01 and item\u00a04. To keep them happy (and assuming they value item\u00a04 highly), I choose to let them have 1 unit of item\u00a04 along with all of item\u00a01. \n\nThen my counteroffer (what I give to Player\u00a02) becomes:\n\u2003Item\u00a01: 3 units,\n\u2003Item\u00a02: 0,\n\u2003Item\u00a03: 0,\n\u2003Item\u00a04: 1 unit,\n\u2003Item\u00a05: 0.\n\nThat results in me receiving the remainder: \n\u2003Item\u00a01: 0,\n\u2003Item\u00a02: 3,\n\u2003Item\u00a03: 0,\n\u2003Item\u00a04: 3\u20131 = 2,\n\u2003Item\u00a05: 3.\nMy resulting raw value is:\n\u20033\u00d790 (item\u00a02) + 2\u00d743 (item\u00a04) + 3\u00d743 (item\u00a05) = 270 + 86 + 129 = 485.\nDiscounted to round 3 outcome: 485\u00d70.81 \u2248 392.85, which narrowly beats my fallback of 392.\n\nThus, I propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 1, 0]}",

I value item 1 at 96 and item 3 at 79 per unit \u2013 so I want to keep the entire supply of these (4 and 3 units, respectively) for myself. Items for which my private values are lower (item 2 at 14 and item 4 at 18) are natural candidates for a full concession. For item 5 I value it at 63 so I would want to keep most of it, but I might need to concede at least a little to make the offer acceptable to Player 2.\n\nThe full pool is:\n\u2022 Item 1: 4 units\n\u2022 Item 2: 9 units\n\u2022 Item 3: 3 units\n\u2022 Item 4: 3 units\n\u2022 Item 5: 3 units\n\nThus one possibility is to offer Player 2 all of items 2 and 4 and a minimal concession on item 5 (1 unit), while keeping all of items 1 and 3 and 2 out of 3 units of item 5. In that case, the division would be:\n\u2022 Offer to Player 2: \n\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 0 units\n\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 9 units\n\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 0 units\n\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 3 units\n\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 1 unit\n\u2022 Which leaves me with:\n\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 4 units\n\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 0 units\n\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 3 units\n\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 0 units\n\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 2 units\n\nMy own payoff from the remaining items would be:\n\u2022 Item 1: 4 \u00d7 96 = 384\n\u2022 Item 3: 3 \u00d7 79 = 237\n\u2022 Item 5: 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\nTotal = 384 + 237 + 126 = 747\n\nThis is well above my outside offer of 382 and makes me very happy. Meanwhile, Player 2 is receiving all of the items that I see as low in value (items 2 and 4) plus a little bit from item 5. Given that Player 2\u2019s private values are drawn uniformly, it is likely that this package will appeal to them as it might be worth a good amount on their side (or at least above their reservation, once they compare with their outside offer). \n\nSo my chosen opening offer (counteroffer) is to give Player 2 [0, 9, 0, 3, 1].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 9, 0, 3, 1]}",

The items I then get are the remainders:\n\u2003\u2003For item i: my allocation = (total units) \u2013 (units given in my offer).\n\nThe totals are: item1: 4, item2: 9, item3: 3, item4: 3, item5: 3.\n\nPlayer\u00a01\u2019s initial offer in Round\u00a01 gives them\n\u2003\u2003[4, 0, 3, 0, 2]\n(where I received [0, 9, 0, 3, 1]).\nThat division would leave me with value 1269 (<1285). I need a small improvement.\nI note that if I reduce the amount I give Player\u00a01 on an item that I value modestly\u2014say item\u00a01 (worth 46 for me)\u2014I can \u201csteal\u201d one unit for myself. For example, if I change my counteroffer so that I offer only 3 units of item\u00a01 (instead of 4 as in the original division), then my share for item\u00a01 becomes 4 \u2013 3 = 1 unit instead of 0.\nAll other items can remain as in their original split. My new allocation would then be:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 9 units\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 0 units\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 3 units\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThen my total value is:\n\u2003\u20031\u00b746 + 9\u00b798 + 0\u00b762 + 3\u00b796 + 1\u00b799 = 46 + 882 + 0 + 288 + 99 = 1305.\n\nThis 1305 is safely above my fallback of 1285, and the change compared to the original proposal is minimal (only taking one unit of item\u00a01 from Player\u00a01). Though I don\u2019t know Player\u00a01\u2019s private values, this slight adjustment should be less aggressive and makes my position better relative to my fallback.\n\nThus, my response is to propose a counteroffer that gives Player\u00a01: [3, 0, 3, 0, 2].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 3, 0, 2]}",

In order to do at least as well as my outside offer (and ideally do better), I want my final allocation (which is the total available minus what I give to Player 1) to have a total value of at least 503. In my numbers the total value of all items is 624 so I can potentially do better. Notice that items 2, 3, and 5 are all fully available in one unit or few units and they are highly valuable to me (67, 45, and 91 respectively). In order to \u201cearn\u201d enough value, I must obtain these and also a portion of item 1. In fact, if I take all of items 2, 3, and 5 I get\n\u2003\u20034\u00d767 + 1\u00d745 + 1\u00d791 = 268 + 45 + 91 = 404.\nThat leaves me needing at least 99 more value. Since each unit of item 1 is worth 44 for me, I must have at least 3 units of item 1 (3\u00d744 = 132) to be above 503. One way to obtain that is to ensure my own allocation is: item 1: 3, item 2: 4, item 3: 1, item 5: 1 (item 4 is not present). That yields a value of 3\u00d744 + 268 + 45 + 91 = 132 + 268 + 45 + 91 = 536, which is above my outside option.\n\nSince the counteroffer is given as what I give to Player 1, my allocation will be the total minus that offer. The totals are [5, 4, 1, 0, 1]. To obtain my desired allocation of [3, 4, 1, 0, 1] I must offer Player 1 the remainder:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 5 \u2013 3 = 2, item 2: 4 \u2013 4 = 0, item 3: 1 \u2013 1 = 0, item 4: 0 \u2013 0 = 0, item 5: 1 \u2013 1 = 0,\nwhich gives the counteroffer [2, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nAlthough Player 1\u2019s initial offer was [1, 4, 1, 0, 1] (giving them [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]), I am raising my own share (aiming for 536 in my value) to beat my outside option. I trust that offering only 2 of item 1 to Player 1 may be sufficiently attractive (since the outside offers are uncertain) especially given that waiting further would incur a discount. \n\nThus, I will respond with the counteroffer that gives Player 1 [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]}",

My own per\u2010unit values are highest for items 2 and 3 (77 and 76 respectively) while item1 (20) is my lowest\u2010value good.\n2. Since I have the option to offer an allocation now that yields an immediate (discount factor 1) deal, I want to keep as many of the high\u2010value items (2 and 3) for myself. At the same time I must give Player 2 enough items \u2013 typically those that are less beneficial to me \u2013 to make the deal attractive compared to their unknown outside offer.\n3. With item1 being my least valued, I can give Player 2 all 4 units, and then add a small share of a couple of lower\u2013but not too low\u2013value items (items 4 and 5) to strengthen their incentive to accept.\n4. One offer that strikes a balance is to give Player 2 all 4 of item1, plus 1 unit each of item4 and item5. This leaves me with all of items 2 and 3 (both 5 units each), and 5 units each of items 4 and 5. This allocation gives me a very high intrinsic value while still providing Player 2 with something.\n5.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 431. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 2, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 2, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
