The current offer value (592) is less than my outside offer, so accepting it would not be rational because it would leave me worse off than my fallback.\\n\\nSince we are in Round 1, there is room to negotiate. I need to propose a counteroffer that appreciates my values more, compared to the value of the outside offer.\\n\\nNow, let's try to make a counteroffer:\\n- I should aim for a value close to or exceeding 991, keeping in mind not to reduce too drastically\\n\\nA possible counteroffer where I get more value could be:\\n- Keep 3 units of item 1 (3 \\u00d7 51 = 153)\\n- Keep 1 unit of item 2 (1 \\u00d7 33 = 33)\\n- Keep 2 units of item 3 (2 \\u00d7 48 = 96)\\n- Keep 2 units of item 4 (2 \\u00d7 17 = 34)\\n- Keep 4 units of item 5 (4 \\u00d7 98 = 392)\\n\\nTotal value = 153 + 33 + 96 + 34 + 392 = 708\\n\\nThis counteroffer still doesn't exceed 991, indicating a need for an even more favorable division of items.\\n\\nLet's make another attempt:\\n- Keep all 4 units of item 1 (4 \\u00d7 51 = 204)\\n- Keep 0 units of item 2 (0 \\u00d7 33 = 0)\\n- Keep 3 units of item 3 (3 \\u00d7 48 = 144)\\n- Keep 2 units of item 4 (2 \\u00d7 17 = 34)\\n- Keep all 5 units of item 5 (5 \\u00d7 98 = 490)\\n\\nTotal value = 204 + 0 + 144 + 34 + 490 = 872\\n\\nThis still doesn't reach 991, but it is significantly improved. It's a choice between providing a significant counteroffer at the risk of not reaching 991, or re-evaluating how much of less important items (like item 4 or 2) I am willing to give away.\\n\\nAdjusting it slightly:\\n- Drop one unit of item 4 (if possible) and claim all others:\\n\\nTherefore, the best possible offer may be:\\n- Keep all 4 units of item 5 (as it has the highest value to me): 4 \\u00d7 98 = 392\\n- Keep all 4 units of item 1: 4 \\u00d7 51 = 204\\n- Keep 3 units of item 3: 3 \\u00d7 48 = 144\\n- Keep 2 units of item 4: 2 \\u00d7 17 = 34\\n- Keep 0 units of item 2: 0 \\u00d7 33 = 0\\n\\nA total of 774, reaching near what I'm aiming but not quite there. However, need to demand the splitting to average out fair deals.\\n\\nLet's finally present a moderate offer balancing towards start of round values:\\n- Transfer [0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2 (to opponent), 3 units of item 3 (balanced split), 3 items of item 4 (less value), and 5 item 5 maintained]\\n- This is a close equilibrium where values share equally between good items (avoid reducing below 900)\\n\\nThe proposed offer to the opponent can be:\\n\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 2, 3, 3, 0]}\",\n",

The current offer value (127) is significantly lower than my outside offer.\\n\\n3. **Evaluate Alternatives and Counteroffer**:\\n    - To craft a counteroffer, I need a distribution that might exceed my outside offer or approach it significantly to provide sufficient incentive for negotiation, considering the discount factor will be applied after this second round.\\n    - I have to make sure not to give away items in a way that my retained value is below 693.\\n    \\n    A potential counteroffer that keeps my value above 693 might be:\\n    - Offer Player 1: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 5\\n    - Retain for myself: 3 units of item 1, all units of item 2 (2), 4 units of item 3 (3 based on counter, I've the 4th), 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\\n\\n   Calculating the retained values:\\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \\u00d7 79 = 237\\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \\u00d7 32 = 64\\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \\u00d7 63 = 189\\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \\u00d7 62 = 186\\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \\u00d7 64 = 192\\n  \\n   Total retained value = 237 + 64 + 189 + 186 + 192 = 868\\n  \\n   As 868 is above my outside offer, offering a reasonable counteroffer balances retained value.\\n\\n4. **Decision**:\\n    - The current offer does not surpass my outside offer value, and accepting it would be less than my alternative. \\n    - Proposing a counteroffer with significantly higher retained value might progress the negotiations positively at this round discount.\\n    \\nThus, I propose the following counteroffer:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [3, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\\n```\",\n",
