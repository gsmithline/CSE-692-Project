Analyzing the Current Situation:**\\n\\n- My outside offer value is 508.\\n- My item values are:\\n  - Item 1: 77\\n  - Item 2: 33\\n  - Item 3: 32\\n  - Item 4: 48\\n  - Item 5: 78\\n- There is no current offer on the table.\\n- It is round 1, and the discount factor for this round, gamma^(r-1), is 1 since gamma is 0.9 and r is 1.\\n\\n**2. Calculating Potential Offers:**\\n\\n- I need to make an initial offer to Player 2.\\n- I should consider an offer that maximizes my value beyond my outside offer of 508.\\n- Given my values, let's examine an allocation where I keep most valuable items:\\n\\n  Suppose I offer:\\n  - 0 units of item 1 (I keep 1)\\n  - 2 units of item 2 (I keep 2)\\n  - 3 units of item 3 (I keep 2)\\n  - 2 units of item 4 (I keep 2)\\n  - 1 unit of item 5 (I keep 1)\\n\\n  My total value calculation for this offer:\\n  - Item 1: 1 * 77 = 77\\n  - Item 2: 2 * 33 = 66\\n  - Item 3: 2 * 32 = 64\\n  - Item 4: 2 * 48 = 96\\n  - Item 5: 1 * 78 = 78\\n  - Total = 77 + 66 + 64 + 96 + 78 = 381\\n\\n  This outcome does not exceed my outside offer of 508. Let's try another distribution.\\n\\n  New counteroffer:\\n  - Offer Player 2: [0, 3, 4, 3, 0] (I keep [1, 1, 1, 1, 2])\\n\\n  My total value with the new proposal:\\n  - Item 1: 1 * 77 = 77\\n  - Item 2: 1 * 33 = 33\\n  - Item 3: 1 * 32 = 32\\n  - Item 4: 1 * 48 = 48\\n  - Item 5: 2 * 78 = 156\\n  - Total = 77 + 33 + 32 + 48 + 156 = 346\\n\\n  Still not exceeding 508. Let's try another allocation.\\n\\n  Final counteroffer:\\n  - Offer Player 2: [0, 4, 5, 4, 0] (I keep [1, 0, 0, 0, 2])\\n\\n  My total value with this offer:\\n  - Item 1: 1 * 77 = 77\\n  - Item 5: 2 * 78 = 156\\n  - Total = 77 + 156 = 233\\n\\n  This is far below 508. Trying another allocation again.\\n\\n  **New attempt**:\\n  - Offer Player 2: [0, 1, 2, 1, 1] (I keep [1, 3, 3, 3, 1])\\n\\n  My total value with this:\\n  - Item 1: 1 * 77 = 77\\n  - Item 2: 3 * 33 = 99\\n  - Item 3: 3 * 32 = 96\\n  - Item 4: 3 * 48 = 144\\n  - Item 5: 1 * 78 = 78\\n  - Total = 77 + 99 + 96 + 144 + 78 = 494\\n\\n  This is close but still under, trying one last, cautiously reduced offer.\\n\\n  **Final offer calculation**:\\n  - Offer Player 2: [0, 2, 3, 1, 1] (I keep [1, 2, 2, 3, 1])\\n\\n  My total value:\\n  - Item 1: 1 * 77 = 77\\n  - Item 2: 2 * 33 = 66\\n  - Item 3: 2 * 32 = 64\\n  - Item 4: 3 * 48 = 144\\n  - Item 5: 1 * 78 = 78\\n  - Total = 429\\n\\n  Still below 508, it's essential to attempt acceptance or resignation using final allocation attempts. However, let's remain firm with counter-offers.\\n\\n- Since none of these configurations exceed my outside offer, I need a strategic mix potentially greater than 508.\\n\\n**3. Making a Decision:**\\n\\nWhile several configurations flirted with 500+, attaining an optimal fit is tricky given hard current numbers. However, maximizing item 5 affects a reduce to options. Initiate counteroffer but adjust based significantly (towards player) to engage Player 2 feasibly:\\n\\n- **Test alignment**:\\n  - Offer Player 2: [0, 0, 3, 3, 1] (I receive [1, 4, 2, 1, 1])\\n\\n  Since my wrap prioritizes high-demand solutions outside scope towards Player 2's favor detailing privately resolved or otherwise strategic agreement.\\n\\nMy thorough calculations promote following response:\\n\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 3, 3, 1]}\",\n",

Therefore, the only practical course without walking is to aim for maximized value across rounds or pursue a better deal assuming the other player values the distribution differently.\\n\\n### Step 3: Decision\\n- Given the maximum aggregate value of all items (599) is still less than my outside offer, accepting any deal where I receive less than all items in this round is not ideal.\\n- Since it's beneficial to attempt a negotiation strategy, offering slightly less than everything to potentially improve the offer and adjust in subsequent rounds if Player 2 values specific items more. \\n\\n### Initial Offer Proposal:\\nLet's make a counteroffer where I keep most high-value items and see if Player 2 accepts a lesser share:\\n- Offer to give Player 2:\\n  - 1 unit from item 1 (keeping 4, highest value per unit)\\n  - 2 units from item 2 (keeping 4)\\n  - 0 units from item 3 (keeping only 1, high value)\\n  - 1 unit from item 4 (keeping 2, highest value per unit)\\n  - 2 units from item 5 (keeping 2)\\n\\nTotal units kept, comes to:\\n- 4 units of item 1 = 132\\n- 4 units of item 2 = 88\\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 51 \\n- 2 units of item 4 = 138\\n- 2 units of item 5 = 22\\nTotal: 431, which is still less than my outside offer. \\n\\nThe strategic purpose of this offer:\\n- Identifying if Player 2 values any particular items to adjust in future rounds.\\n\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]}\",\n",

Thus, this specific counteroffer isn't beneficial unless adjusted. We need a better value.\\n\\n3. **Decision and Justification:**\\n   Using the above calculations, ensure the counteroffer should be revised to provide a value at least a bit higher, given the discount rate will not apply in round 1:\\n   \\n   - Adjust the proposal to:\\n     - Offer 1 unit of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 3 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4 and 1 unit of Item 5 to Player 2. Calculate accordingly again:\\n\\n   - Keep for ourselves:\\n     - 4 units of Item 1: 4 \\u00d7 88 = 352\\n     - 1 unit of Item 2: 1 \\u00d7 16 = 16\\n     - 3 units of Item 3: 3 \\u00d7 11 = 33\\n     - 1 unit of Item 4: 1 \\u00d7 82 = 82\\n     - 2 units of Item 5: 2 \\u00d7 25 = 50\\n     \\n   **Revised Total Value:** 352 + 16 + 33 + 82 + 50 = 533\\n\\n   This value is again insufficient; however, opportunity maybe negotitated at next round with adjusting unit 1 margin slightly.\\n\\n4. **Conclusion:**\\n   \\n   - **Action:** Make a counteroffer, pushing marginally more where value projection needs, as ground must be met from discounting in future rounds yet, attempt with units kept for practical outcome yield:\\n   ```json\\n   {\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]}\\n   ```\\n   Adjust further if exchanged for prompt negotiation shifts overcoming initial outward limits.\",\n",

I need to ensure the value I get is greater than my outside offer of 564.\\n\\n#### Potential Counteroffer Scenarios\\nI need to allocate items to maximize my value and ensure it's greater than 564 and also consider offering Player 2 enough value that they might accept.\\n\\nIf I keep all items, the potential value to me would be:\\n\\n- Item 1: 4 units \\u00d7 20 = 80\\n- Item 2: 6 units \\u00d7 32 = 192\\n- Item 3: 9 units \\u00d7 78 = 702\\n- Item 4: 5 units \\u00d7 5 = 25\\n- Item 5: 5 units \\u00d7 22 = 110\\n- **Total value = 80 + 192 + 702 + 25 + 110 = 1109**\\n\\nI cannot keep all the items as that would be an offer of zero to Player 2, which they would not accept. I need to make a reasonable counteroffer that gives me at least 564 in value.\\n\\nA hypothesis for a good initial counteroffer could be to keep enough high-value items for myself, while offering something to Player 2. I must strategically consider how much value I can hold without making my offer unattractive to Player 2.\\n\\n### Deciding a Fair Counteroffer\\nA strong offer to make could involve offering Player 2 a fair amount of items while still ensuring I surpass my reservation value. Consider offering:\\n\\n- My Offer to Player 2: [2, 3, 3, 3, 3] (leaving me with [2, 3, 6, 2, 2])\\n\\n#### Value for this Counteroffer (Keeping for Myself):\\n- Item 1: 2 units \\u00d7 20 = 40\\n- Item 2: 3 units \\u00d7 32 = 96\\n- Item 3: 6 units \\u00d7 78 = 468\\n- Item 4: 2 units \\u00d7 5 = 10\\n- Item 5: 2 units \\u00d7 22 = 44\\n\\n- **My Total Value = 40 + 96 + 468 + 10 + 44 = 658**\\n\\nThis value (658) exceeds my reservation value (564). Thus, it's a reasonable proposition as it offers me significant value while providing the opponent some items they might consider valuable.\\n\\n### Step 3: Decision\\nGiven these considerations, I will make the counteroffer.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3]}\\n```\",\n",

Here's a possible distribution strategy:\\n\\n   One simple initial offer strategy can be:\\n   - Give Player 2 fewer of the high-value items like item 2, maximizing retention in areas where I value items more highly.\\n\\n   Let me make a sample counteroffer with most items, such that my retained value is high:\\n\\n6. **Offer Proposal Calculation**:\\n    - If I keep most of the items and pay attention to optimizing retention on high-value items like 2 and 3:\\n        - Retain: 1 (Item 1), 4 (Item 2), 4 (Item 3), 2 (Item 4), 2 (Item 5)\\n        - Offer: 1 (Item 1), 2 (Item 2), 2 (Item 3), 3 (Item 4), 3 (Item 5)\\n\\n7. **Value Calculation of Retained Items**:\\n    - 1 unit of Item 1 = 1 \\u00d7 43 = 43\\n    - 4 units of Item 2 = 4 \\u00d7 93 = 372\\n    - 4 units of Item 3 = 4 \\u00d7 36 = 144\\n    - 2 units of Item 4 = 2 \\u00d7 22 = 44\\n    - 2 units of Item 5 = 2 \\u00d7 33 = 66\\n    - Total value with retention = 43 + 372 + 144 + 44 + 66 = 669\\n\\n8. **Final Decision**:\\n    - Considering my outside offer is 766, and accounting for the discount factor in round 2, my initial proposal should aim for a bit higher return. Thus, I should reallocate more values toward retaining high-value items or walk away eventually if counter dealings still fall short after discount.\\n    \\n    - I will make an aggressive initial offer hoping to negotiate better in round 2 or 3.\\n\\nTherefore, I\\u2019ll make a counteroffer where Player 2 receives: \\n    {\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [1, 2, 3, 3, 3]}\",\n",

I can therefore either walk away or propose a counteroffer that could potentially give me a better total value.\\n\\n**Decision**\\n\\nI should make a counteroffer that ensures my total potential value is greater than my outside offer. Here's one possible counteroffer:\\n\\n- Offer 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 (leaving me with [4, 2, 2, 2, 0])\\n\\nCalculating the value:\\n\\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \\u00d7 65 = 260\\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \\u00d7 17 = 34\\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \\u00d7 47 = 94\\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \\u00d7 90 = 180\\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \\u00d7 21 = 0\\n- Total value = 568\\n\\nThis is a much higher value than my outside offer of 352.\\n\\nTherefore, I will make the following counteroffer.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]}\\n```\",\n",

I need to propose a counteroffer that provides me a total value greater than 352 after the discount in round 3.\\n\\nLet's consider a counteroffer:\\n- I should aim to get units that would maximize my value. Prioritizing higher valued items:\\n  - Suppose I keep all 4 units of item 1, all 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 for myself:\\n  - My value would be:\\n    - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \\u00d7 65 = 260\\n    - 0 units of item 2 = 0\\n    - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \\u00d7 47 = 188\\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \\u00d7 90 = 180\\n    - 0 units of item 5 = 0\\n  - Total offer value = 260 + 0 + 188 + 180 + 0 = 628\\n  - Discounted value at round 3 = 628 \\u00d7 0.9^2 = 508.68\\n\\nSince 508.68 (discounted) is significantly greater than my outside offer of 352, I will counter with this offer.\\n\\nMy counterproposal is that Player 1 gets 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. \\n\\nHence, my action is:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]}\\n```\",\n",

For an initial offer, a balanced approach to maximize our value would be a good start.\\n\\n#### Strategy for Initial Offer:\\n- Aim to offer a division where the items we keep have a value clearly above our reservation value, even after the potential discount in subsequent rounds.\\n- Initial suggested division proposal:\\n  - Offer 1 unit of Item 1, 2 units of Item 3, and 1 unit of Item 5 to Player 2.\\n  - We keep the rest, calculating value as follows:\\n    - Player 1\\u2019s kept items: \\n      - 4 items of Item 1: \\\\( 4 \\\\times 67 = 268 \\\\)\\n      - 3 items of Item 2: \\\\( 3 \\\\times 5 = 15 \\\\)\\n      - 8 items of Item 3: \\\\( 8 \\\\times 44 = 352 \\\\)\\n      - 2 items of Item 4: \\\\( 2 \\\\times 10 = 20 \\\\)\\n      - 3 items of Item 5: \\\\( 3 \\\\times 35 = 105 \\\\)\\n    - Total Value = 760\\n\\nSince 760 multiplied by any discount less than or equal to 1 is still above 583, this is a fair start.\\n\\nThus, I propose the counteroffer:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]}\\n```\",\n",

Therefore, any counteroffer I make needs to exceed my reservation value (647) when considering the discount factor.\\n\\n### 3) Decision\\n\\nSince there is no current offer from Player 2 on the table, I need to decide on a counteroffer that maximizes my value above the reservation value of 647 when using the negotiation multiplier.\\n\\nGiven the items and my values, I need a distribution that gives me significant value. A viable approach is to offer a division that allows me to retain a valuable proportion which meets or exceeds my reservation value after discounting:\\n\\nLet's attempt a division:\\n- Offer Player 2: \\n  - 3 units of Item 1\\n  - 3 units of Item 2\\n  - 1 unit of Item 3\\n  - 0 units of Item 4\\n  - 1 unit of Item 5\\n\\nThus, I propose to receive:\\n- 1 unit of Item 1: \\\\( 1 \\\\times 15 = 15 \\\\)\\n- 1 unit of Item 2: \\\\( 1 \\\\times 20 = 20 \\\\)\\n- 2 units of Item 3: \\\\( 2 \\\\times 37 = 74 \\\\)\\n- 2 units of Item 4: \\\\( 2 \\\\times 53 = 106 \\\\)\\n- 2 units of Item 5: \\\\( 2 \\\\times 43 = 86 \\\\)\\n\\nTotal value = \\\\( 15 + 20 + 74 + 106 + 86 = 301 \\\\)\\n\\nSince \\\\( 301 \\\\) is considerably lower than my reservation value, I need to revise this offer. Let's try a different division:\\n\\nOffer Player 2:\\n- 2 units of Item 1\\n- 2 units of Item 2\\n- 1 unit of Item 3\\n- 0 units of Item 4\\n- 2 units of Item 5\\n\\nThen, I receive:\\n- 2 units of Item 1: \\\\( 2 \\\\times 15 = 30 \\\\)\\n- 2 units of Item 2: \\\\( 2 \\\\times 20 = 40 \\\\)\\n- 2 units of Item 3: \\\\( 2 \\\\times 37 = 74 \\\\)\\n- 2 units of Item 4: \\\\( 2 \\\\times 53 = 106 \\\\)\\n- 1 unit of Item 5: \\\\( 1 \\\\times 43 = 43 \\\\)\\n\\nTotal value = \\\\( 30 + 40 + 74 + 106 + 43 = 293 \\\\)\\n\\nIt looks like all possible offers that distribute items don't allow me to exceed the value of my outside offer. \\n\\nHowever, my primary aim is to maintain sufficient value. Let\\u2019s choose the most balanced offer:\\n\\nOffer Player 2:\\n- 2 units of Item 1\\n- 2 units of Item 2\\n- 1 unit of Item 3\\n- 0 units of Item 4\\n- 2 units of Item 5\\n\\nCounteroffer:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [2, 2, 1, 0, 2]}\\n```\",\n",

The value of 507.6 is lower than my outside offer.\\n  \\nGiven that the current value of 507.6 is significantly less than my reserved value of 697, accepting this offer is not beneficial.\\n\\n3) Comparison for Possible Counteroffers:\\nLet's consider a very beneficial counteroffer to ensure I maximize my gain:\\n\\n- My ideal would be a total value greater than 697 / 0.81 (if counteroffer is made in the next round with 0.81 discount factor), i.e., needing a total value of about 860 to match my reservation value.\\n  \\nGiven that the items' total potential value to me without any discount (sum of all individual maximum values) is:  \\n  - Item 1: 1 \\u00d7 14 = 14\\n  - Item 2: 5 \\u00d7 82 = 410\\n  - Item 3: 3 \\u00d7 92 = 276\\n  - Item 4: 1 \\u00d7 10 = 10\\n  - Item 5: 8 \\u00d7 77 = 616\\n  - Total potential value = 14 + 410 + 276 + 10 + 616 = 1326\\n\\nFinding a share that achieves a total of 860 in discounted value is difficult. Therefore, considering these constraints and the upcoming discount, an optimal counteroffer might be infeasible. Thus, walking away is rational here as I should expect the outside offer.\\n\\n4) Decision:\\nGiven that our current discounted value when accepting does not compete with our reservation value and making a counteroffer would likely result in an unrealistic value, my decision is to walk away.\\n\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"WALK\\\"}\",\n",

My goal is to maximize my value while also keeping the probability of acceptance by Player 2.\\n\\n   Let's consider keeping the maximum valued items for myself (especially item 4, which has the highest per-unit value for me):\\n   - Suppose I offer Player 2 the minimum I believe might be acceptable:\\n     - Offer Player 2:\\n       - 1 unit of item 1\\n       - 1 unit of item 2\\n       - 1 unit of item 3\\n       - 0 units of item 4\\n       - 0 units of item 5\\n   - This leaves me with:\\n     - 3 units of item 1 = \\\\( 3 \\\\times 19 = 57 \\\\)\\n     - 6 units of item 2 = \\\\( 6 \\\\times 6 = 36 \\\\)\\n     - 4 units of item 3 = \\\\( 4 \\\\times 15 = 60 \\\\)\\n     - 4 units of item 4 = \\\\( 4 \\\\times 29 = 116 \\\\)\\n     - 4 units of item 5 = \\\\( 4 \\\\times 7 = 28 \\\\)\\n   - Total value = \\\\( 57 + 36 + 60 + 116 + 28 = 297 \\\\)\\n\\n   Clearly, this value is still far less than my reservation value of 747, so this is not a good solution. Given that my values are relatively low and I have a high reservation value, achieving more than 747 directly from the available items is challenging unless I try other divisions. Since my division value is constantly too low, my action choice is forced.\\n\\n3) **Decision:**\\n   - Since a reasonable counteroffer seems unable to exceed my outside offer value of 747 considering my values per item and without knowing Player 2\\u2019s preferences, I shall opt to WALK away.\\n\\nTherefore, my action is to walk away, as achieving my reservation value with the items available seems implausible given the constraints:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"WALK\\\"}\\n```\",\n",

Thus, we should consider a counteroffer or walking away. Let's attempt a counteroffer.\\n\\n**Counteroffer Proposal:**\\nTo maximize my gain but ensure the offer is better than the outside offer, let's try a more favorable distribution for myself:\\n\\nLet's propose an offer where I prioritize maximization but improve my current offer's potential value.\\n- Keep 4 units of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 4 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5 for myself.\\n\\nTherefore, my counteroffer will be:\\n- To Player 2: [1, 3, 1, 1, 0]\\n\\nNow, re-evaluate the potential value:\\n- 4 units of Item 1: 4 \\u00d7 91 = 364\\n- 0 units of Item 2: 0 \\u00d7 33 = 0\\n- 4 units of Item 3: 4 \\u00d7 28 = 112\\n- 2 units of Item 4: 2 \\u00d7 13 = 26\\n- 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \\u00d7 3 = 3\\n- Total value = 364 + 0 + 112 + 26 + 3 = 505\\n\\nWith discount factor: 505 \\u00d7 0.9 = 454.5\\n\\nThis new offer gives me less than my outside offer after discounting but provides a logic thresholds attempt at negotiation in our current context. The next round is crucial since Player 2 gets to choose to either accept, walk, or counter.\\n\\n**Final Decision:**\\nBecause I haven't entirely reached a sustainable counter, but aim to test the threshold, and reduce to solutions below my reservation grounds if declined, I propose this more appealing split intended to draw a mutual center yield.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [1, 3, 1, 1, 0]}\\n```\",\n",

This implies achieving \\n     a counteroffer value that leads to \\\\( Total value > \\\\frac{544}{0.81} \\\\approx 671.6 \\\\) in raw terms. Let\\u2019s think of a counteroffer that achieves this.\\n\\n3) **Decision Making:**\\n   - The current offer yields me a value of 481, which is less than my outside offer of 544.\\n   - Since 481 is less than 544, I should not accept this offer.\\n   - To create a counteroffer that would be viable for me, my objective should be more than 544 adjusted by the discount factor for round 2.\\n\\nNow I need to formulate a counteroffer:\\nLet me create an offer that maximizes my value:\\n\\n- I want to maximize my values for items 1 and 4, as they have very high values.\\n- Let's counteroffer [0, 0, 5, 0, 7] giving up item 2 since Player 1 valued them in the current proposal and must want them, while I value them less without sufficient comeback on necessary value items.\\n\\nNow, I'll calculate the total value if I receive the opposite of my counteroffer:\\n- Item 1: 4 units = 4 \\u00d7 92 = 368\\n- Item 2: 3 units = 3 \\u00d7 84 = 252\\n- Item 3: 0 units = 0 \\u00d7 12 = 0\\n- Item 4: 4 units = 4 \\u00d7 91 = 364\\n- Item 5: 0 units = 0 \\u00d7 17 = 0\\n\\nSo, Total Value = 368 + 252 + 0 + 364 + 0 = 984 \\n\\nSo this offer gives me a value greater than the requirement 544. But, let's be reasonable. This is too imbalanced and more unlikely for Player 1 to consider reasonable giving up value convincingly.\\n\\n- I'll tone it down: let's try [1, 0, 2, 2, 3] as real closure attempt. \\n\\nHence, my proposed Counteroffer is for the items I don't need as much, but hold onto as where reasonable distribution to come across strongly as possible closure. \\n\\nHere\\u2019s my counteraction:\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [1, 0, 2, 2, 3]}\\n```\",\n",

Instead, we need to try to keep some more valuable items, knowing that this first round applies full value with no discounts.\\n\\nLet's posit instead if keeping 1 unit of each, building for more inviting offer and reassessment by round adjustment:\\n\\nCalculate the outcome with keeping:\\n\\n- 1 unit of item 1 (31), 3 unit of item 2 (258), 0 unit of item 3 (0), 4 units of item 4 (68), 2 units of item 5 (110):\\n\\nNow let me present a counter for trimming down my excess side to this:\\n\\n**Offer Player 2:** 2 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\\n\\nThis should allow me to reach relevant recalculation for increased expected value by dominance left holding next:\\n\\nReceiving (for her if this becomes accepted):\\n- 1 units of item 1 (31), 3 units of item 2 (258), 0 units of item 3 (0), 4 units of item 4 (68), 2 units of item 5 (110), overall reaching maximum profit effective past this round:\\n\\n**New proposal balance evaluation allows:** \\\\(31 + 258 + 0 + 68 + 110 = 467 \\\\)\\nWithout discount **will urge counter or compliance invigorations.**\\n\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [2, 1, 2, 2, 0]}\",\n",

Therefore, accepting is not ideal.\\n- **Counteroffer**: I can consider making a counteroffer that results in a higher value than my outside offer.\\n\\nSince walking at this point results in my outside offer value, and accepting yields less, I need to propose a counteroffer that might give me a value higher than 480 when adjusted for the next round's discount factor.\\n\\n#### Potential Counteroffer:\\nLet's aim for a distribution that provides me a value above 480 when considered with the discount factor for round 2 (0.9).

Let's try to maximize:\\n\\nSuppose I offer:\\n- Item 1: 1 unit (I keep 3)\\n- Item 2: 0 unit (I keep 2)\\n- Item 3: 0 unit (I keep 2)\\n- Item 4: 0 unit (I keep 1)\\n- Item 5: 1 unit (I keep 1)\\n\\n##### Total value if I keep:\\n- Value for 3 units of Item 1: \\\\(3 \\\\times 73 = 219\\\\)\\n- Value for 2 units of Item 2: \\\\(2 \\\\times 40 = 80\\\\)\\n- Value for 2 units of Item 3: \\\\(2 \\\\times 22 = 44\\\\)\\n- Value for 1 unit of Item 4: \\\\(1 \\\\times 29 = 29\\\\)\\n- Value for 1 unit of Item 5: \\\\(1 \\\\times 78 = 78\\\\)\\n\\nTotal value: \\\\(219 + 80 + 44 + 29 + 78 = 450\\\\)\\n\\n##### Discounted total-value if I counter in Round 2 (after negotiations in Round 1):\\n- Discounted counteroffer total: \\\\(450 \\\\times 0.9 = 405\\\\)\\n\\nSince 405 is still less than 440, but it\\u2019s the highest possible allocation for round 2 given values; let's establish our counteroffer calculated on being optimal for round negotiations:\\n\\n### Optimal Strategy\\n\\nI should aim for a COUNTEROFFER which would be greater in value than my outside offer 440, likely a higher value combination retained by me, but still lowering concede possibility in initial phase to obtain better negotiation outcome next.\\n\\nTherefore, the optimal COUNTEROFFER will be:\\n\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\\n\",\n",

I'll consider keeping most of the items I value highly and offering a fair share to Player 2.\\n\\n   Counter offer idea, to keep the value high on my end:\\n   - Offer 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\\n   - My value for this counteroffer:\\n     - 5 * 72 = 360 (I keep all 5 of item 1)\\n     - 1 * 32 = 32 (I keep 1 of 2 units of item 2)\\n     - 3 * 70 = 210 (I keep 3 of 4 units of item 3)\\n     - 3 * 3 = 9 (I keep all 3 of item 4)\\n     - 1 * 4 = 4 (I keep all of item 5)\\n     - Sum = 615\\n\\n   615 < 675. So, this counteroffer is not valuable because it's below my outside offer.\\n\\n   - Adjust offer: Offer 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\\n   - My value for this counteroffer:\\n     - 5 * 72 = 360\\n     - 2 * 32 = 64\\n     - 2 * 70 = 140\\n     - 3 * 3 = 9\\n     - 1 * 4 = 4\\n     - Sum = 577 (< 675)\\n\\n   - Adjust offer further: Offer 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\\n   - My value for this counteroffer:\\n     - 5 * 72 = 360\\n     - 2 * 32 = 64\\n     - 4 * 70 = 280\\n     - 3 * 3 = 9\\n     - 0 * 4 = 0\\n     - Sum = 713\\n\\n   - Total value of 713 > 675 after discount.

Let's determine various potential counteroffers I could make:\\n\\n   **Example Counteroffer:**\\n   - Give 2 units of item 1 (Keeping 1 unit) \\n   - Give 3 units of item 2 (Keeping 2 units)\\n   - Give 0 units of item 3 (No units to give)\\n   - Give 4 units of item 4 (Keeping 4 units)\\n   - Give 1 unit of item 5 (Keeping 2 units)\\n\\n   Calculation for my value with the above divisions:\\n   - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \\u00d7 29 = 29\\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \\u00d7 17 = 34\\n   - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \\u00d7 68 = 0\\n   - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \\u00d7 29 = 116\\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \\u00d7 89 = 178\\n   - Total = 29 + 34 + 0 + 116 + 178 = 357\\n\\n   This value of 357 is less than my outside offer of 680, which wouldn't be acceptable even if we consider the discount factor. I need to adjust my offer to attempt a higher value or I could choose to walk away.\\n\\n3) Decision:\\n   - The potential division considered gives me a lower value than my outside offer.\\n   - I need a counteroffer that potentially improves value.\\n   - I'll try a counteroffer where I keep the maximum units of the most valued items:\\n\\n   **Improved Counteroffer**\\n   - Give 0 units of item 1 (Keeping 3 units)\\n   - Give 2 units of item 2 (Keeping 3 units)\\n   - Give 0 units of item 3 (No units to give)\\n   - Give 3 units of item 4 (Keeping 5 units)\\n   - Give 0 units of item 5 (Keeping 3 units)\\n\\n   Calculation:\\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \\u00d7 29 = 87\\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \\u00d7 17 = 51\\n   - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \\u00d7 68 = 0\\n   - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \\u00d7 29 = 145\\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \\u00d7 89 = 267\\n   - Total = 87 + 51 + 0 + 145 + 267 = 550\\n\\n   This value of 550 is still less than my outside offer of 680. To maximize my gain under the constraints given by the possible divisions, it's best to counteroffer while considering acceptable division for Player 2's value as well:\\n\\n   Final Counteroffer:\\n   - Give 0 units of item 1 (Keep all for myself)\\n   - Give 3 units of item 2 (Keeping 2 units)\\n   - Give 0 units of item 3 (Keeping all for myself, though item count is 0)\\n   - Give 3 units of item 4 (Keeping 5 units)\\n   - Give 2 units of item 5 (Keeping 1 unit)\\n\\n   Calculation for this division:\\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 87\\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 34\\n   - 0 units of item 3 = 0\\n   - 5 units of item 4 = 145\\n   - 1 unit of item 5 = 89\\n   - Total = 355\\n\\n   This is not enough to exceed the outside offer of 680. I will try to happy medium division:\\n\\n   Let's make a counteroffer that gives me:\\n   - 3 units of item 1\\n   - 1 units of item 2\\n   - 0 units of item 3\\n   - 6 units of item 4\\n   - 1 units of item 5\\n\\n   Counteroffer Calculation:\\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 87\\n   - 1 units of item 2 = 17\\n   - 0 units of item 3 = 0\\n   - 6 units of item 4 = 174\\n   - 1 unit of item 5 = 89\\n   - Total = 367\\n\\n   This value still does not exceed 680, indicating my preferred action might just be to walk away if no better offer is available. However, I will make a counteroffer which potentially makes negotiations continue and try to attend to both players max value.\\n\\nFinal reasonable COUNTEROFFER:\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 2, 0, 2, 2]}\\n```\\n\\nThis gives me 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 of item 3, 6 of item 4, and 1 of item 5. Total value is: \\n- 3 units item 1 = 87 \\n- 3 units item 2 = 51\\n- 0 units item 3 = 0\\n- 6 units item 4 = 174\\n- 1 unit item 5 = 89\\n\\nTotal = 271, which exceeds total of earlier calculations but still less than 680, but proposes a division for Player 2 to consider to see if they'd accept or propose a counter.\",\n",

Thus, accepting this offer would not be beneficial.\\n\\n   - **Potential Counteroffer with Total Values**:\\n     To make a counteroffer that would exceed my outside offer value, I need to explore possible distributions of items:\\n     - Retaining more valuable items such as item 4 (60 per unit) and item 2 (39 per unit) could bring the negotiated value closer to the outside offer.\\n\\n     Example Counteroffer: Consider giving Player 1 few units from lower valued items (or fewer from higher values if needed) to maximize my outcome.\\n     - Offer Player 1: [1, 1, 0, 2, 2], keeping more of items 2 and 4.\\n     - Value to Player 2:\\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \\u00d7 17 = 34\\n       - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \\u00d7 39 = 156\\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \\u00d7 40 = 0\\n       - 6 units of item 4 = 6 \\u00d7 60 = 360\\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \\u00d7 11 = 11\\n       - Total value = 34 + 156 + 0 + 360 + 11 = 561 \\n     - This offer approaches the value of my outside offer more closely, but with round 2's discount (561 \\u00d7 0.9 = 504.9), this does not exceed 576.\\n\\n   Strategy aims to negotiate a useful counteroffer or prepare to walk away to the outside offer if terms remain unsatisfactory.\\n\\n3) **Decision:**\\n   With the current offer value significantly below the outside offer, and considering potential counteroffers are unlikely beneficial post-discount, the prudent approach is to walk away with the outside offer since it ensures a better guaranteed value.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"WALK\\\"}\\n```\",\n",

Based on my outside offer value, it makes sense to WALK away from the negotiation as making a higher offer doesn't align with achieving a value over my reservation point of 742 given the constraints.\\n\\n### Decision\\nConsidering the calculations and evaluation, I will take the following action:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"WALK\\\"}\\n```\",\n",

      "    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n",

      "    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n",
      "    There are 1 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\n",
      "    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n",
      "    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\n",
      "    Your private values are 26 for item 1, 41 for item 2, 65 for item 3, 91 for item 4, 74 for item 5.\n",
      "    Both you and Player 1 also have a private outside offer, of value drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 1000.\n",
      "    Your outside offer value is 18. In theory, this 18 could be viewed as your “reservation value.” It could be seen as the threshold below which any proposed division would be inferior to your guaranteed baseline, and above which you improve upon that baseline. This reservation value could serve as a key reference point, guiding your decisions on when to accept, reject, or propose offers.\n",
      "    Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 18. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n",
      "    3 units of item 1 = 3 × 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n",
      "    3 units of item 2 = 3 × 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n",
      "    3 units of item 3 = 3 × 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n",
      "    3 units of item 4 = 3 × 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n",
      "    3 units of item 5 = 3 × 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n",
      "    Total value = 891 (sum of all item values)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    This would be greater than your outside offer of 18.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n",
      "    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\n",
      "    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n",
      "    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n",
      "    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n",
      "    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\n",
      "    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Let's solve this step by step:\n",
      "\n",
      "    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\n",
      "    - What is my outside offer value? \n",
      "    - What are my item values?\n",
      "    - What is the current offer (if any)?\n",
      "    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\n",
      "    - If I am considering making a counteroffer, what is the next round's discount factor (as that counteroffer will be realized in the next round, hence the discount factor will be gamma^(r+1-1) as opposed to gamma^(r-1) for the current round)?\n",
      "\n",
      "    2) Then, let's calculate:\n",
      "    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\n",
      "    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\n",
      "    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\n",
      "    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\n",
      "    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\n",
      "\n",
      "    3) Let's decide:\n",
      "    - Should I accept the current offer?\n",
      "    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\n",
      "    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\n",
      "\n",
      "    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\n",
      "    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n",

      "\n",
