However, this division favors me excessively. I need to split items in a more balanced way while ensuring my portion's value remains above 903.\\n\\n   Let's adjust the offering while maintaining a total greater than 903:\\n   - Give 5 units of Item 1 to Player 2:\\n     - My resulting value for Item 1: 2 \\u00d7 31 = 62\\n   - Give 4 units of Item 2 to Player 2:\\n     - My resulting value for Item 2: 3 \\u00d7 97 = 291\\n   - I can't give any of Item 3 as there are none, so value = 0.\\n   - Give 2 units of Item 4 to Player 2:\\n     - My resulting value for Item 4: 2 \\u00d7 55 = 110\\n   - Still keep 1 of Item 5.\\n     - My resulting value for Item 5: 1 \\u00d7 72 = 72 \\n\\n   New total value for me = 62 + 291 + 0 + 110 + 72 = 535\\n\\n   The value is less than my outside offer. Let's tweak items to ensure I meet my needs and it slightly favors Player 2.\\n\\n   - Let's go with: \\n     - My offer to Player 2: 3 units of Item 1, 5 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 0 units of Item 5\\n\\n   Recalculate:\\n   - 4 units of Item 1 for me: 4 \\u00d7 31 = 124\\n   - 2 units of Item 2 for me: 2 \\u00d7 97 = 194\\n   - 0 units of Item 3\\n   - 2 units of Item 4 for me: 2 \\u00d7 55 = 110\\n   - 1 units of Item 5 for me: 1 \\u00d7 72 = 72\\n   - Total for me: 124 + 194 + 0 + 110 + 72 = 500\\n\\n   Value with this distribution to me, still less than 903. Let's modify to give them the following offering:\\n\\n   - My offer to Player 2: 2 units of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 0 unit of Item 5\\n\\n   Recalculate:\\n   - 5 units of Item 1 for me: 5 \\u00d7 31 = 155\\n   - 5 units of Item 2 for me: 5 \\u00d7 97 = 485\\n   - 0 units of Item 3\\n   - 2 units of Item 4 for me: 2 \\u00d7 55 = 110\\n   - 1 units of Item 5 for me: 1 \\u00d7 72 = 72\\n   - Total for me: 155 + 485 + 0 + 110 + 72 = 822\\n\\n   This is still less. After significant trying to find direct combinations, I conclude keeping the risk reduction as even small ticks over is non-beneficial unless confirming value.\\n\\n3) **Decision:**\\n   - After trying different combinations and balancing, I'm unable to find a valid offer on round 1 that sufficiently matches my outside offer and appropriately resolves to above my value for items.\\n   - Since my outside offer is 903, assessing my computation we've found the type variance can't bypass over 900.\\n     \\nSo based on calculations and informed adjustment:\\n\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"WALK\\\"}\",\n",

To ensure a counteroffer is better than my outside offer, I'll calculate values for potential divisions where my total portion exceeds 971.\\n\\n#### Example Counteroffer\\nLet's consider a possible counteroffer where I receive most of the valuable items:\\n- Offer to Player 2: [4, 5, 3, 3, 2]\\n- Units I keep: [1, 0, 0, 1, 2]\\n\\n**Calculation:**\\n- Value of Item 1: 1 \\u00d7 41 = 41\\n- Value of Item 2: 0 \\u00d7 13 = 0\\n- Value of Item 3: 0 \\u00d7 15 = 0\\n- Value of Item 4: 1 \\u00d7 23 = 23\\n- Value of Item 5: 2 \\u00d7 29 = 58\\n- Total value = 41 + 0 + 0 + 23 + 58 = 122\\n\\n122 is significantly less than my outside offer of 971. Therefore, keeping at least 1 unit of each high-value item does not make a valuable counteroffer at this stage.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nGiven my outside offer is high at 971, any worthwhile counteroffer must give me a significant portion of the items or high unit combinations that can beat the value, taking into account it needs to be higher than 971 from the start. It seems improbable without knowing Player 2's values. Hence, the potential value from any feasible offer would be unlikely to exceed my outside offer.\\n\\n### Step 3 and 4: Optimal Action\\nMy optimal decision is to walk away, as my outside offer\\u2019s value of 971 is likely higher than any value achievable from dividing the items.\\n \\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"WALK\\\"}\\n```\",\n",

Let\\u2019s consider other divisions:\\n\\n#### Potential Counteroffers:\\nI need to keep a combination of items that exceeds the outside offer value (433). Here\\u2019s a viable counteroffer:\\n1. Give Player 2: 3 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\\n   - Retain: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\\n   - Calculate value retained:\\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 30\\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1\\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 78\\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0\\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0\\n   - **Total retained value:** 109\\n\\nClearly, the retained value is still far below the outside offer of 433, thus requiring a strategic choice.\\n\\n#### Consider Retaining Combinations:\\nLooking at other combinations that could result in 433 or more, effectively:\\n2. Give Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\\n   - Retain: 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\\n   - Calculate value retained:\\n     - 4 units of item 1 = 120\\n     - 0 unit of item 2 = 0\\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 78\\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0\\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0\\n   - **Total retained value:** 198\\n\\nThe retained value is still not reaching or exceeding the 433 threshold.\\n\\n### Step 3: Evaluate Outcomes\\n- **Accept:** Not applicable since no offer.\\n- **Counteroffer:** Based on the calculations, it\\u2019s challenging to beat the outside offer value, given the provided constraints.\\n  \\n### Step 4: Decision\\nGiven that none of the divisions I've calculated exceed my outside offer value of 433, making a counteroffer that meets or exceeds the threshold is currently infeasible.
