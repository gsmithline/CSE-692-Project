Let's assume, for now that I want to keep the maximum amount of high-value items as possible. I could consider offering player 2 a minimal amount of items.\\n    *    **Option 1:** Offer Player 2 0 of everything. This would yield: (3 * 55) + (6 * 35) + (2 * 31) + (1 * 94) + (7 * 30) = 165 + 210 + 62 + 94 + 210 = 741.\\n         * This value of 741 is less than my outside offer, so is not a good idea.\\n    *   **Option 2:** Offer Player 2 1 of everything except item 4 (as there is only one of these) \\n         *  This means that I will keep 2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 6 of item 5\\n         * This would yield (2 * 55) + (5 * 35) + (1 * 31) + (0 * 94) + (6 * 30) = 110 + 175 + 31 + 0 + 180 = 496\\n         * This would still not be good, so I should offer player two at least less of item 4. \\n    * **Option 3** Offer player 2 1 of items 1, 2, 3 and 5, while keeping 0 of item 4 (I will keep item 4 for myself)\\n        * This means I would keep 2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 6 of item 5\\n        * (2 * 55) + (5 * 35) + (1 * 31) + (1 * 94) + (6 * 30) = 110 + 175 + 31 + 94 + 180 = 590. This is still less than my outside offer. \\n        * It seems that I can never keep the minimum items for myself and get a good deal. I need to offer very little to the other player.\\n    * **Option 4** Offer player 2 1 unit of items 1 and 5.\\n        * This means that I will keep 2 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 6 units of item 5.\\n        *  (2 * 55) + (6 * 35) + (2 * 31) + (1 * 94) + (6 * 30) = 110 + 210 + 62 + 94 + 180 = 656\\n        * This is better than all the others so far, but still not enough.\\n    * **Option 5** Offer player 2 1 unit of item 5, keep the rest for myself\\n        * This means that I will keep 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 6 units of item 5.\\n        *  (3 * 55) + (6 * 35) + (2 * 31) + (1 * 94) + (6 * 30) = 165 + 210 + 62 + 94 + 180 = 711\\n*   **Discount factor effect:** Since it's round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^0 = 1, so it doesn't affect the values this round.\\n\\n**3) Decide:**\\n\\n*   Since it's round 1, I need to make an offer. \\n*   I must calculate a reasonable offer where I keep the bulk of high value items. If I offer too much to the other player, I will end up with a value below my outside offer value. \\n*   From my calculations above, it seems offering player 2 1 unit of item 5 is the most reasonable offer that still maximizes value for myself, whilst still being a valid and reasonable offer.\\n*   Therefore I will make an initial offer of 1 unit of item 5 to player 2.\\n\\n**Action:**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

Discounted value = 0 * 0.9 = 0.\\n*   **Outside offer discounted value:** My outside offer is 993, discounted by 0.9 for round 2 gives a value of 993 * 0.9 = 893.7.\\n\\nNow, let's consider some potential counteroffers. I want to maximize my value, so I'll focus on keeping items that I value highly (item 4, item 1).  I will consider keeping all of item 4, then try some distributions on the other items. The total units for each item are: 3 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 7 of item 5.\\n\\n*   **Counteroffer 1:** Let's try offering player 2 none of item 4 and item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, and 4 of item 5. My offer will be [0, 1, 1, 0, 4].  This means I would keep: 3 item 1, 5 item 2, 1 item 3, 1 item 4 and 3 item 5.\\n    *   My Value: (3 * 55) + (5 * 35) + (1 * 31) + (1 * 94) + (3 * 30) = 165 + 175 + 31 + 94 + 90 = 555\\n    *   Discounted value: 555 * 0.9 = 499.5. This is less than my outside offer.\\n*  **Counteroffer 2:** Let's try offering player 2 none of item 4, all of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, and all of item 5. My offer will be [3, 1, 1, 0, 7].  This means I would keep: 0 item 1, 5 item 2, 1 item 3, 1 item 4 and 0 item 5.\\n    * My Value: (0 * 55) + (5 * 35) + (1 * 31) + (1 * 94) + (0 * 30) = 0 + 175 + 31 + 94 + 0 = 300\\n    *   Discounted value: 300 * 0.9 = 270. This is less than my outside offer.\\n\\nLet's think about how to maximize the value of the items I keep, while also making a reasonable offer to the other player. Since Item 4 is my highest value, I should keep it. Let's try and keep as much of item 1 as possible too.\\n*   **Counteroffer 3:** Let's offer player 2 0 of item 4, 0 of item 1, and 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, and 7 of item 5. My offer will be [0, 3, 2, 0, 7]. This means I keep 3 item 1, 3 item 2, 0 item 3, 1 item 4, and 0 of item 5.\\n    * My Value: (3 * 55) + (3 * 35) + (0 * 31) + (1 * 94) + (0 * 30) = 165 + 105 + 0 + 94 + 0 = 364\\n    *   Discounted Value: 364 * 0.9 = 327.6, still less than my outside offer.\\n\\n*   **Counteroffer 4:** Let's offer player 2 0 of item 4, 1 of item 1, and 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, and 7 of item 5. My offer will be [1, 3, 2, 0, 7]. This means I keep 2 item 1, 3 item 2, 0 item 3, 1 item 4, and 0 of item 5.\\n    * My Value: (2 * 55) + (3 * 35) + (0 * 31) + (1 * 94) + (0 * 30) = 110 + 105 + 0 + 94 + 0 = 309\\n    *   Discounted Value: 309 * 0.9 = 278.1. Still less than my outside offer.\\nSince I am not currently being offered anything, it is likely I will have to be aggressive with my offer if I want to agree on a deal, however I will still have to make an offer which is more valuable than my walk away offer of 893.7. Since I only have one round left to secure a deal, walking away is a good idea if I cannot reach my outside offer value.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nSince none of the offers calculated are better than my outside offer of 893.7, I will choose to walk away.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"WALK\\\"}\\n```\\n\"\n",

Let's revise.\\n\\nI will offer Player 2 [0,2,3,3,0]. This means I receive:\\n* 5 of item 1 = 5*42 = 210\\n* 5 of item 2 = 5*68 = 340\\n* 1 of item 3 = 1*17 = 17\\n* 4 of item 4 = 4*77 = 308\\n* 1 of item 5 = 1*60 = 60\\n\\nTotal value: 210 + 340 + 17 + 308 + 60 = 935\\nDiscounted value = 935*0.9=841.5\\n\\nThis discounted value is very close to the discounted outside offer value (832.5). I could make a very aggresive counteroffer to attempt to get more, but the risk of walking is too high, so this seems like a good balance of risk/reward. \\n\\n**Action:**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 2, 3, 3, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

For round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1.\\n\\n**2) Calculations:**\\n\\n*   **Value of Current Offer:**\\n    *   Item 1: 3 * 20 = 60\\n    *   Item 2: 6 * 54 = 324\\n    *   Item 3: 0 * 13 = 0\\n    *   Item 4: 1 * 76 = 76\\n    *   Item 5: 0 * 95 = 0\\n    *   Total Value: 60 + 324 + 0 + 76 + 0 = 460\\n\\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** My current offer value is 460, which is greater than my outside offer value of 312.\\n\\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\\n    Since my current offer is better than my outside offer, I will not walk away. Let's consider what a counteroffer would look like, to understand if I should accept or make a counteroffer. A few scenarios worth considering:\\n       1. Offer a minimally better split for player 1, to check if that is sufficient. I'll give back 0 for every item they offered me.\\n          My offer would be: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The value to me will be what I get, which is [3, 6, 8, 1, 6].\\n          My total value is: (3*20) + (6*54) + (8*13) + (1*76) + (6*95) = 60+324+104+76+570 = 1134\\n          This looks good!\\n       2. Offer a fair split for player 1. For simplicity, let us divide each item in half and round up if necessary.\\n          My offer would be: [2, 3, 4, 1, 3]\\n          My remaining items will be: [1, 3, 4, 0, 3]\\n          My total value will be: (1*20) + (3*54) + (4*13) + (0*76) + (3*95) = 20+162+52+0+285= 519. This looks good!\\n\\n*   **Discount Factor:** Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 1, so it doesn't affect the calculations.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nThe current offer gives me a value of 460, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 312. Making an offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] would be very advantageous. Since I am in round 1, it is not necessary to try to get the most out of this first round, I will offer [2, 3, 4, 1, 3], which is a more reasonable split.\\n\\n**Action:**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [2, 3, 4, 1, 3]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

I have 6 units of item 1, 5 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4 and 5 of item 5. A fair division would be [3, 2, 2, 2, 2] for both players.

Furthermore, if I do choose to make a counteroffer I will be forced to accept an outcome in round 3 as the last action, meaning a discount will apply to my return.\\n*   Therefore, the optimal move is to ACCEPT the current offer.\\n\\n**Action:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"ACCEPT\\\"}\\n```\\n\"\n",

My value for this would be:\\n         (0 * 38) + (4 * 78) + (4 * 79) + (2 * 8) + (2 * 45) = 0 + 312 + 316 + 16 + 90 = 734\\n        \\n* **Comparing to outside offer:**\\n    * Accepting the current offer (0) is much worse than my outside offer (109).\\n    * My previous offer to player 2 had a value of 375, which is way greater than the outside offer\\n    * The offer to player 2 where I keep most of the items has a value of 734, which is also way greater than the outside offer\\n*   **Discount factor:** Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.  This means that if I accept the counteroffer of [0,1,1,1,0] it would yield a value of 734*0.9=660.6 and if I accepted my original offer (given it was offered to me) my value would be 375*0.9=337.5, both which are larger than my outside offer.\\n\\n**3) Decide:**\\n\\n*   Accepting the current offer is not good as my value would be 0.\\n*   Walking away is not optimal, as I can potentially get a deal worth more than my outside offer of 109, even when considering the discount factor.\\n*   Therefore, I should make a counteroffer. Given that I should try to maximize the value and I prefer more of items 2 and 3, I will make the counteroffer of [0,1,1,1,0] to player 2.\\n\\n**Action:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

Player 1 offered 1 item each of 2, 3, and 4 (leaving them 4, 4, and 2 respectively). It is in player 2's best interest to keep most of items 4 and 5 due to their high value. It is also optimal to keep items 1 (because it is also high value). Since Player 1 has a few units of items 2 and 3 remaining, we need to make an offer that is better than their current offer, but also is not too greedy to be rejected. Let's try offering to take 4 each of items 2 and 3, and keep 2 of item 4 and 2 of item 5 and 0 of item 1. So, offer Player 1 [0, 1, 1, 1, 0] (same as previous offer to player 2)\\n\\n* **Value of Keeping [0, 4, 4, 2, 2]:**\\n    *   0 units of Item 1: 0 * 87 = 0\\n    *   4 unit of Item 2: 4 * 1 = 4\\n    *   4 unit of Item 3: 4 * 51 = 204\\n    *   2 unit of Item 4: 2 * 76 = 152\\n    *   2 units of Item 5: 2 * 91 = 182\\n    *   Total value: 0 + 4 + 204 + 152 + 182= 542\\n    * Discounted Value at round 2: 542 * 0.9 = 487.8\\n\\n* **Value of Keeping [0, 5, 5, 3, 2]:** This would mean Player 1 gets nothing. \\n    *   0 units of Item 1: 0 * 87 = 0\\n    *   5 unit of Item 2: 5 * 1 = 5\\n    *   5 unit of Item 3: 5 * 51 = 255\\n    *   3 unit of Item 4: 3 * 76 = 228\\n    *   2 units of Item 5: 2 * 91 = 182\\n    *   Total value: 0 + 5 + 255 + 228 + 182= 670\\n    * Discounted Value at round 2: 670 * 0.9 = 603\\n    \\nThis is a very high offer and may be rejected. Let's be more reasonable with our counteroffer. Let's offer [0, 3, 3, 2, 1], keeping for ourselves [0, 2, 2, 1, 1].\\n\\n* **Value of Keeping [0, 2, 2, 1, 1]:**\\n    *   0 units of Item 1: 0 * 87 = 0\\n    *   2 unit of Item 2: 2 * 1 = 2\\n    *   2 unit of Item 3: 2 * 51 = 102\\n    *   1 unit of Item 4: 1 * 76 = 76\\n    *   1 units of Item 5: 1 * 91 = 91\\n    *   Total value: 0 + 2 + 102 + 76 + 91 = 271\\n    * Discounted Value at round 2: 271 * 0.9 = 243.9\\n\\nThis is still not better than our outside offer.

So far the best offer for us has been taking everything. Let's give a counteroffer that gives less of items 2 and 3.

It's the last round, I need to at least make my outside offer.

However, since this is the last round, any counteroffer will be treated as a walk. If I choose to make an offer, I will get my outside offer (581), so I should make the best offer for me.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nSince this is the final round, I will try to make the highest valued counteroffer, as it will be treated as a walk. I will try to take everything.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

It's the first round, so there is no offer on the table from Player 2.\\n*   **Round:** 1\\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9\\n\\n**2) Calculations:**\\n\\n*   **Accepting Current Offer:** Since there is no current offer, accepting it would be impossible.\\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**  I need to consider what I want to keep for myself while offering something to Player 2, remembering that my goal is to exceed my outside offer of 717 when the discount factor is considered.  Since it is round 1, the discount factor does not yet have a detrimental effect. \\n  \\nLet's start by working out the total value of the items.\\nTotal of each item:\\nItem 1: 3 units * 3 = 9\\nItem 2: 1 unit * 17 = 17\\nItem 3: 4 units * 13 = 52\\nItem 4: 7 units * 64 = 448\\nItem 5: 4 units * 28 = 112\\n\\nTotal item value: 9 + 17 + 52 + 448 + 112 = 638.\\n\\nSince I value the total item value at 638, and my outside offer is 717, I would only accept an offer that exceeds my outside offer. If I offered player 2 everything, I would get nothing, so I need to be careful.\\n\\nI will try offering player 2 the following values, and keep the rest for myself:\\nItem 1 = 1\\nItem 2 = 0\\nItem 3 = 1\\nItem 4 = 2\\nItem 5 = 1\\n\\nWhich means that I keep:\\nItem 1 = 2\\nItem 2 = 1\\nItem 3 = 3\\nItem 4 = 5\\nItem 5 = 3\\n\\nThis would result in the following value for me:\\n2*3 + 1*17 + 3*13 + 5*64 + 3*28 = 6 + 17 + 39 + 320 + 84 = 466\\n\\nThat is not good enough.\\n\\nLet's try offering player 2 the following amounts:\\nItem 1 = 0\\nItem 2 = 0\\nItem 3 = 0\\nItem 4 = 1\\nItem 5 = 0\\n\\nThat would result in the following value for me:\\n3*3 + 1*17 + 4*13 + 6*64 + 4*28 = 9 + 17 + 52 + 384 + 112 = 574\\nThis is also not good enough.\\nSince my values are spread out across multiple items, it seems I should offer as little as possible. I will try to push player 2 by offering very little.\\n\\nLet's offer the following:\\nItem 1 = 0\\nItem 2 = 0\\nItem 3 = 0\\nItem 4 = 0\\nItem 5 = 0\\n\\nThis way, I get everything, and so my value is equal to the total item value of 638. Since the discount factor is 0.9, my value in this round is just 638, which is less than my outside offer value of 717, and I would prefer to walk.\\n\\nHowever, since this is round 1, it is best to try to negotiate a better deal, rather than walk.\\n\\nTherefore, I will offer player 2 the following items:\\n\\nItem 1: 0\\nItem 2: 0\\nItem 3: 0\\nItem 4: 1\\nItem 5: 0\\nThat means I am keeping:\\nItem 1: 3\\nItem 2: 1\\nItem 3: 4\\nItem 4: 6\\nItem 5: 4\\nMy value is: 3 * 3 + 1 * 17 + 4 * 13 + 6 * 64 + 4 * 28 = 9 + 17 + 52 + 384 + 112 = 574\\n\\nThis is a better outcome than offering them nothing, so I will proceed with this counteroffer.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nI will make the counteroffer detailed above.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

Let's try to calculate the values for a more balanced offer.\\nLet's consider offering half of all the items to player 2, keeping the remaining for ourselves:\\n\\n* Offer: 1 item 1, 1 item 2, 3 item 3, 3 item 4, 2 item 5\\n* Keep: 1 item 1, 2 item 2, 4 item 3, 4 item 4, 2 item 5\\n*   **Keeping 1, 2, 4, 4, and 2**:\\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 50 = 50\\n    *   Item 2: 2 * 68 = 136\\n    *   Item 3: 4 * 58 = 232\\n    *   Item 4: 4 * 11 = 44\\n    *   Item 5: 2 * 55 = 110\\n    *   Total Value: 50 + 136 + 232 + 44 + 110 = 572\\nThis is lower than my outside offer, therefore lets consider the following offer to player 2:\\n\\n* Offer: 0 item 1, 0 item 2, 2 item 3, 3 item 4, 0 item 5\\n* Keep: 2 item 1, 3 item 2, 5 item 3, 4 item 4, 4 item 5\\n\\n*   **Keeping 2, 3, 5, 4, and 4**:\\n    *   Item 1: 2 * 50 = 100\\n    *   Item 2: 3 * 68 = 204\\n    *   Item 3: 5 * 58 = 290\\n    *   Item 4: 4 * 11 = 44\\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 55 = 220\\n    *   Total Value: 100 + 204 + 290 + 44 + 220 = 858\\n\\nThis value is significantly higher than my outside offer, giving player 2 value in items that I have low value for will encourage a deal.\\nThe discount factor for round 1 is 0.9^0 = 1, so it doesn't affect the value this round.\\n\\n**3) Decide:**\\n\\nI will make a counteroffer to maximize my outcome.\\nThe best option is to give some lower value items to player 2 in order to get a higher value in the items I prefer, while also trying to achieve a deal.\\nI will offer 0 items 1 and 2, 2 items 3, 3 items 4, and 0 items 5.\\n\\n**Action:**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 2, 3, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

My value is then:\\n    Value = (2-x1)*50 + (3-x2)*68 + (7-x3)*58 + (7-x4)*11 + (4-x5)*55\\n    And the discounted value is:\\n    Discounted Value = Value * 0.9^(2-1) = Value * 0.9\\n\\n    Let's consider a few possible counteroffers:\\n\\n    *   **Counteroffer 1: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0]** (I give away 4 of item 3 and 4 of item 4 to player 2)\\n        *   I get: (2 * 50) + (3 * 68) + (3 * 58) + (3 * 11) + (4 * 55) = 100 + 204 + 174 + 33 + 220 = 731.\\n        *   Discounted value = 731 * 0.9 = 657.9\\n        *   This is > 621\\n\\n    *   **Counteroffer 2: [0, 0, 2, 3, 0]** (I give away 2 of item 3 and 3 of item 4 to player 2, which is the same as the other player's first offer)\\n        *   I get: (2 * 50) + (3 * 68) + (5 * 58) + (4 * 11) + (4 * 55) = 100 + 204 + 290 + 44 + 220 = 858.\\n        *   Discounted value = 858 * 0.9 = 772.2\\n        * This is > 621\\n\\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** Accepting the current offer is worth 0, which is much less than my outside offer of 621.

The maximum I can get is if I take all of the items.\\n\\n    Let's calculate my value if I keep all of the items for myself:\\n    *   Item 1: 6 * 71 = 426\\n    *   Item 2: 9 * 9 = 81\\n    *   Item 3: 5 * 75 = 375\\n    *   Item 4: 4 * 45 = 180\\n    *   Item 5: 5 * 73 = 365\\n    *   Total Value = 426 + 81 + 375 + 180 + 365 = 1427\\n\\n    Since this is the last round, my discounted value would be 1427 * 0.9^(3-1)= 1427 * 0.81 = 1155.87.

We also need to consider the discount factor. In round 1 the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1, so there is no impact.\\n    Let's consider what would have to be the case for the negotiation to lead to a deal in the future. We can not know Player 1's value, so we have to estimate it. One fair way to do this is to calculate the 'fair' value of the items to Player 1, based on the mean of the uniform distribution from which the values are drawn i.e. 101/2 = 50.5 and then use that to make a realistic counteroffer based on giving Player 1 a better deal than their outside value which they are not going to tell us. We have no information to make any better choice at this stage. Since player 1's outside value will lie between 1 and 1000, let's aim to offer player 1 at least 500 in total value. The value of items is based on the uniform random distribution, so the mean value per item will be 50.5. Player 1 would value 1 unit of item 1 at 50.5, 10 units of item 2 at 505, 5 units of item 3 at 252.5, 4 units of item 4 at 202 and 2 units of item 5 at 101. This means to give a mean value of over 500 to Player 1 we could consider, for example, giving all of the units of item 2 to player 1. This gives them value 10 * 50.5 = 505, which is above the mean of the uniform distribution for their outside offer, and ensures we keep all the other items, making this a strong move for our first round.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nThe current offer is terrible.  Walking away would get me my outside offer of 35. Making a counteroffer could get me a better outcome. I will make a counteroffer where I keep all items except item 2. This offer to Player 1 is: [0, 10, 0, 0, 0]\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 10, 0, 0, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

I must keep in mind that a deal must be better than my outside option of 782.\\n\\n   Here's a breakdown of how I'll think about counteroffers and values, keeping in mind I need to offer some combination of items totaling the entire amount of each item:\\n        - There are 3 units of item 1.\\n        - There are 4 units of item 2.\\n        - There are 0 units of item 3.\\n        - There are 6 units of item 4.\\n        - There are 5 units of item 5.\\n\\n    I could offer the following to player 2 and keep the remainder.

I should keep all units of items 1, 2, 4, and 5 since my unit values for these items are higher than that of item 3. Item 3 has a value of 0. Let's calculate the value of keeping all the items for myself:\\n    \\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 * 90 = 270\\n    4 units of item 2 = 4 * 2 = 8\\n    0 units of item 3 = 0 * 35 = 0\\n    6 units of item 4 = 6 * 25 = 150\\n    5 units of item 5 = 5 * 93 = 465\\n    Total value of all items: 270 + 8 + 0 + 150 + 465 = 893\\n\\n    Since 893 < 952, it is not even optimal for me to get all the items. Thus, I know this will be a hard bargain.\\n\\n*   **Effect of discount factor:**\\n    Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1. The discount factor does not affect values in this round. In later rounds, the values would be multiplied by the discount factor.\\n\\n**3) Deciding on an action:**\\n\\n*   Accepting the current offer is terrible since it yields a value of 0, much less than my outside offer.\\n*   The total value of the item is 893, which is also less than my outside offer of 952. Therefore, I will not benefit from any division of the items.\\n*   Since I am in round one, it is unlikely the other player is going to offer me something better than my outside offer in the next round. Therefore, I should walk away.\\n\\n**Action:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"WALK\\\"}\\n```\\n\"\n",

I should make an offer that aims to give me a high overall value. I'm going to try and offer all of my high value items, and keep the lower value items to myself. This should give me the highest value in the deal, in theory.\\nI should give the other player as much of my item 1 and item 2 as possible, because I value them less than the others. Since I have 2 units of item 1 and 5 units of item 2, let's offer them all to the other player.\\n\\n**Action:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [2, 5, 0, 0, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

This would leave me with [2, 2, 1, 2, 3]. Let's calculate the value to me of this:\\n    *   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 15 = 30\\n    *   2 units of item 2 = 2 * 17 = 34\\n    *   1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 89 = 89\\n    *   2 units of item 4 = 2 * 95 = 190\\n    *   3 units of item 5 = 3 * 83 = 249\\n    *   Total value to me = 30 + 34 + 89 + 190 + 249 = 592\\n    *   Discounted Value = 592 * 0.9 = 532.8\\n\\n    This is still far worse than my outside offer, but it at least allows me a chance for negotiation. Let's try another: how about offering Player 2 [0,2,0,0,0] for a total value of 2 x 17 = 34\\n    This would leave me with [2,3,1,3,5]\\n    *   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 15 = 30\\n    *   3 units of item 2 = 3 * 17 = 51\\n    *   1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 89 = 89\\n    *   3 units of item 4 = 3 * 95 = 285\\n    *   5 units of item 5 = 5 * 83 = 415\\n    *   Total value to me = 30 + 51 + 89 + 285 + 415 = 870\\n    *   Discounted Value = 870 * 0.9 = 783\\n\\nLet's try an offer of [0,0,0,0,0] This would leave me with [2,5,1,3,5]\\n* 2 units of item 1 = 2*15 = 30\\n* 5 units of item 2 = 5*17 = 85\\n* 1 units of item 3 = 1*89 = 89\\n* 3 units of item 4 = 3*95 = 285\\n* 5 units of item 5 = 5*83 = 415\\nTotal value = 30 + 85 + 89 + 285 + 415 = 904\\nDiscounted value = 904 * 0.9 = 813.6\\nThis is also worse than my outside offer but I have a large preference for items 3,4,5 and I get all of them. This is a good offer.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nAccepting the current offer is terrible. Walking away gives me 938, and the counter offers don't quite reach that, even after being discounted. However, I should make a counteroffer as round 3 might yield worse value. I will make the counteroffer of [0,0,0,0,0] which gives me the most value out of the calculated offers.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

Since it's round 1, there's no discount yet, so I can aim for an offer that is simply greater than my outside offer.\\n    *   **Scenario: Keep everything.** Let's see how much I'd get keeping all units to myself:\\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 100 = 200\\n        *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 52 = 156\\n        *   6 units of item 3: 6 * 55 = 330\\n        *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 64 = 256\\n        *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 41 = 123\\n        *   Total value: 200 + 156 + 330 + 256 + 123 = 1065. This is much better than my outside option.\\n\\n        *   **Scenario: Offer the other player a small amount of everything.** To try and encourage the other player to accept, I can give a small amount of each item. I will offer the other player 1 unit of items 1, 2 and 3, and 0 of items 4 and 5. This seems like a reasonable starting point that is likely better for me than my outside offer. So i would get to keep:\\n        *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 100 = 100\\n        *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 52 = 104\\n        *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 55 = 275\\n        *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 64 = 256\\n        *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 41 = 123\\n        *   Total value: 100+104+275+256+123= 858. This is less than my outside offer. This is not a good idea for me.\\n        *   **Scenario: Offer only items I value less:** Let's try to give away the items I value the least (4 and 5). If I offer Player 2 2 units of Item 4 and 2 units of Item 5:\\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 100 = 200\\n        *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 52 = 156\\n        *   6 units of item 3: 6 * 55 = 330\\n        *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 64 = 128\\n        *   1 units of item 5: 1 * 41 = 41\\n        *   Total value: 200 + 156 + 330 + 128 + 41= 855. This is less than my outside offer, so not good.\\n\\n   * **Comparison to outside offer:** Keeping everything gives me 1065 > 882.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nGiven that it's round 1, the discount factor is 1, and keeping everything is well above my outside offer value, I should make an offer where I keep everything. To do so, I will offer the other player nothing, meaning I keep all items for myself.\\n\\n**Action:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

This means Player 2 is offering me 0 units of each item.\\n*   **Round & Discount Factor:** It's round 2, and the discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. The discount applied this round will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\\n\\n**2) Calculations:**\\n\\n*   **Value of Accepting Current Offer:** Accepting [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] means I receive 0 units of each item, resulting in a value of 0.\\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that provides a value greater than my discounted outside offer. I have a total of 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5. I must give some number of each item to Player 2 and keep the rest for myself.\\n    *   **Scenario 1: Keep all items:** If I kept all items I have 4 * 37 + 4 * 21 + 6 * 63 + 0 * 52 + 5 * 61 = 148 + 84 + 378 + 0 + 305 = 915, which discounted to this round is 915 * 0.9 = 823.5. \\n    *   **Scenario 2: Offer equal split (where possible) :** I could offer 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3 and 2 units of item 5 to player 2 giving me 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3 and 3 units of item 5. \\n    This would give me 2 * 37 + 2 * 21 + 3 * 63 + 3 * 61 = 74 + 42 + 189 + 183 = 488. Discounted value is 488 * 0.9 = 439.2\\n    \\n    *   **Scenario 3: Offer a minimal amount to the player 2 and keep most of items:** Offering player 2 [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] will leave me with [3,3,5,0,4]. \\n     This gives me 3 * 37 + 3 * 21 + 5 * 63 + 0 * 52 + 4 * 61 = 111 + 63 + 315 + 0 + 244 = 733. Discounted value is 733 * 0.9 = 659.7.\\n\\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** My outside offer, discounted for this round, is 272 * 0.9 = 244.8. Any counteroffer I make should have a value greater than 244.8 for me to consider it. Any of the scenarios 1, 2 or 3 are beneficial. As Scenario 3 gives a better return for me I will use this.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nThe current offer is worth 0 to me, which is less than my outside offer and any reasonable counteroffer will exceed the outside offer when discounted. Therefore, I should not accept. I will make a counteroffer, choosing to make the offer that gives the largest discounted value to me.\\n\\n**Action:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

So the discounted value = 915 * 0.9^2 = 915 * 0.81 = 741.25\\n\\n*   **Value of Walking Away:**\\n    My outside offer value is 272, which must be discounted by gamma ^ (round -1). Discounted Value of Walking away = 272 * 0.9^2 = 272 * 0.81 = 220.32\\n\\n*   **Value of Potential Counteroffers**\\n     Since we are in the last round, if Player 2 makes a counteroffer in response to me, this will be treated as a walk. Therefore, I need to determine what is my best final outcome. Because I would get all items if I accept the current offer and this would value the most for me, any division that gives me less would be irrational. Therefore, I should accept if it's not less than my outside option.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\n*   The discounted value of accepting the current offer (741.25) is significantly higher than the discounted value of walking away (220.32).\\n* Since it is the final round, there are no future rounds to consider.\\n*   Therefore, accepting the current offer is my optimal choice.\\n\\n**Final Answer:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"ACCEPT\\\"}\\n```\\n\"\n",

This means they get the rest: [6, 1, 2, 1, 1].\\n*   **Round and Discount:** It is round 1, and the discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. The discount factor for this round is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1.\\n\\n**2) Calculations:**\\n\\n*   **Value of Accepting Current Offer:**\\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 51 = 153\\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 49 = 196\\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 86 = 172\\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 95 = 95\\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 20 = 20\\n    *   Total value: 153 + 196 + 172 + 95 + 20 = 636\\n    *   Discounted total value: 636 * 1 = 636\\n\\n*   **Comparing to Outside Offer:** 636 is much greater than my outside offer of 26.\\n\\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's explore a counter offer where I try to keep more of the items that I value the most. I currently am receiving a good value from the current offer, so I will try to keep the same total value, but shift items in my direction.\\n\\nLet me make a counteroffer of [4, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This gives me [5, 4, 3, 2, 2]. Let me calculate the value of the counter offer:\\n    *   5 units of item 1: 5 * 51 = 255\\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 49 = 196\\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 86 = 258\\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 95 = 190\\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 20 = 40\\n    *   Total value: 255 + 196 + 258 + 190 + 40 = 939\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\n*   The current offer is very good for me, providing a value of 636, compared to my outside option value of 26. The discount factor is 1 since it's the first round. I am confident Player 1 does not know my private values, so if I counter offer, I could potentially get a higher value by getting more of the items I value, such as item 3 and item 4, and giving up some of the item 1 and item 2. However, this may be risky since the total value I get from the current offer is already much higher than my outside offer. The counteroffer I will make is [4, 1, 1, 0, 0], which I calculated the value of to be 939 which is very high.\\n\\n**Final Action:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [4, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

This would be keeping all items for myself: \\n    * 9 units of item 1: 9 * 18 = 162\\n    * 5 units of item 2: 5 * 96 = 480\\n    * 4 units of item 3: 4 * 17 = 68\\n    * 2 units of item 4: 2 * 32 = 64\\n    * 2 units of item 5: 2 * 34 = 68\\n    * Total: 842\\nDiscounted value = 842 * 0.9 = 757.8, this is much greater than accepting the current offer.\\nLet me also test a counter offer where I give Player 2: [5, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This would leave me:\\n    * 4 units of item 1: 4 * 18 = 72\\n    * 4 units of item 2: 4 * 96 = 384\\n    * 3 units of item 3: 3 * 17 = 51\\n    * 1 units of item 4: 1 * 32 = 32\\n    * 1 units of item 5: 1 * 34 = 34\\n    * Total: 573\\n    Discounted value = 573 * 0.9 = 515.7, which is also much greater than my current offer.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nSince accepting the current offer has a value of 166.5 and my outside offer has a value of 63, accepting is better than walking away. Also, there's a good chance that my counteroffer of giving them as little as possible would be more beneficial. \\n\\nLet's make a counteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

My goal is to maximize my value, considering the discount factor. Let's consider a few scenarios for a counteroffer, by determining what I would keep and therefore give to the other player, in each scenario. Let's start by considering a variety of fairly even divisions and then move to consider more extreme offers.\\n\\n**Scenario 1: Even Split**\\nLet's assume I keep roughly half of each item, giving the other half to player 2 (where 'half' represents rounding up if the item has an odd number of units).\\n*   I keep 3 of item 1 (3 x 26 = 78)\\n*   I keep 4 of item 2 (4 x 85 = 340)\\n*   I keep 1 of item 3 (1 x 91 = 91)\\n*   I keep 1 of item 4 (1 x 76 = 76)\\n*   I keep 2 of item 5 (2 x 82 = 164)\\n*   Total value for me: 78 + 340 + 91 + 76 + 164 = 749\\n\\nIf I keep the above items for myself, I give to player 2:\\n*  2 of item 1\\n*  3 of item 2\\n*  1 of item 3\\n*  1 of item 4\\n*  1 of item 5\\nMy offer would be [2, 3, 1, 1, 1]\\nThis is much lower than my outside offer and is unacceptable to me.\\n\\n**Scenario 2: Keep more of high value items**\\nLet's assume I keep more of my high value items and less of my low value items.\\n*   I keep 4 of item 1 (4 x 26 = 104)\\n*   I keep 6 of item 2 (6 x 85 = 510)\\n*   I keep 2 of item 3 (2 x 91 = 182)\\n*   I keep 2 of item 4 (2 x 76 = 152)\\n*   I keep 2 of item 5 (2 x 82 = 164)\\n*   Total value for me: 104 + 510 + 182 + 152 + 164 = 1112\\n\\nIf I keep the above items for myself, I give to player 2:\\n*  1 of item 1\\n*  1 of item 2\\n*  0 of item 3\\n*  0 of item 4\\n*  1 of item 5\\nMy offer would be [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\\nThis is above my outside offer and is acceptable, though perhaps I can get more.\\n\\n**Scenario 3: Keep almost everything**\\nLet's keep everything I can, without making an offer of zero items to the other player, as this would be unliklely to be accepted.\\n*   I keep 5 of item 1 (5 x 26 = 130)\\n*   I keep 7 of item 2 (7 x 85 = 595)\\n*   I keep 2 of item 3 (2 x 91 = 182)\\n*   I keep 2 of item 4 (2 x 76 = 152)\\n*   I keep 2 of item 5 (2 x 82 = 164)\\n*   Total value for me: 130 + 595 + 182 + 152 + 164 = 1223\\n\\nIf I keep the above items for myself, I give to player 2:\\n*  0 of item 1\\n*  0 of item 2\\n*  0 of item 3\\n*  0 of item 4\\n*  1 of item 5\\nMy offer would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\\nThis is a high value for me and could be a risky first offer, given it leaves very little for player 2, however I think it's important to put in an ambitious first offer.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nSince it's round 1, the discount factor doesn't affect the immediate value calculation. I will aim high and offer player 2 as little as possible to see what I can get. I will make a counteroffer based on scenario 3.\\n\\n**Action:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

We have a total of 5 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. Let's propose keeping all of items 1, 2, 3 and 4, and 2 of the 3 units of item 5. This leaves one unit of item 5 for the other player. This counter offer means we are giving Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1].\\n    *   Value of keeping 5 units of item 1: 5 * 55 = 275\\n    *   Value of keeping 7 units of item 2: 7 * 71 = 497\\n    *   Value of keeping 2 units of item 3: 2 * 36 = 72\\n    *   Value of keeping 2 units of item 4: 2 * 33 = 66\\n    *   Value of keeping 2 units of item 5: 2 * 92 = 184\\n    *   Total value of this potential offer: 275 + 497 + 72 + 66 + 184 = 1094\\n    *   Discounted value: 1094 * (0.9^0) = 1094.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\n*   The value of accepting the current offer (92) is much less than my outside offer (539).\\n*   The value of keeping items 1-4, and all but 1 unit of item 5 (1094), is far greater than my outside offer.

It's unlikely Player 1 will immediately offer me most of everything. Let's aim for at least a value of 855. Considering the value I place on item 2, its the most likely place to focus. If I can get most of item 2 it will help push my value above 855. I will start by offering 2 units of item 1, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5 to player 1. This means keeping 0 item 1, 6 item 2, 5 item 3, 4 item 4, 3 item 5\\n\\n    *   Value from keeping item 2: 6 * 89 = 534\\n    *   Value from keeping item 3: 5 * 3 = 15\\n    *   Value from keeping item 4: 4 * 7 = 28\\n    *   Value from keeping item 5: 3 * 11 = 33\\n    *   Total value = 534 + 15 + 28 + 33= 610\\n    \\n    This value, 610, is lower than my outside offer value of 855.\\n    \\n     Let's try to secure most of the item 2's.

Given I only have 7 of these that is impossible. I need to focus on the fact that I can get my outside offer with no negotiation.\\n     \\n     I should aim for value that is better than my outside offer given any future discounting.\\n    \\n     Let's try offering player 1 0 item 1, 0 item 2, 0 item 3, 0 item 4, 0 item 5. This would leave me with all items\\n\\n    * 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 67 = 134\\n    * 7 units of item 2 = 7 * 89 = 623\\n    * 6 units of item 3 = 6 * 3 = 18\\n    * 5 units of item 4 = 5 * 7 = 35\\n    * 4 units of item 5 = 4 * 11 = 44\\n    * Total Value = 134 + 623 + 18 + 35 + 44 = 854\\n\\n     This would give me a total value of 854, which is still slightly below my outside offer. I need to do better given the discounting in later rounds.\\n\\n     Let's try offering player 1, 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5, which is 0 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5 for me.\\n\\n     *   7 units of item 2: 7 * 89 = 623\\n    \\n      This value is well below my outside offer, however my outside offer is good enough in round 1 that it is going to be difficult to beat. I will need to leverage future rounds to potentially get value above 855. Let's try this one for this round, and see what player 1 comes back with.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nSince accepting the current offer is terrible and my outside offer is a strong position to be in, I'm going to make a counteroffer.\\n\\n**Action:**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [2, 0, 6, 5, 4]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

I need to keep as much of that as possible.\\nLet's consider offering Player 1 a reasonable trade.\\n\\n*   **Potential Counteroffer:** Give Player 1 items that I don't value much and keep the ones I value highly for myself.\\n\\n    Let's try offering Player 1 [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] which would leave me with [2, 6, 5, 4, 3].\\n    \\n    *   Value of my counteroffer [2,6,5,4,3]:\\n        *   Item 1: 2 * 67 = 134\\n        *   Item 2: 6 * 89 = 534\\n        *   Item 3: 5 * 3 = 15\\n        *   Item 4: 4 * 7 = 28\\n        *   Item 5: 3 * 11 = 33\\n        *   Total: 134+534+15+28+33 = 744\\n\\n    The discounted value of this counteroffer is 744 * 0.9 = 669.6, which is less than my discounted outside offer. However, this is round 2. I could make a counteroffer again with a higher return next round.\\n    Since 744 < 855. I would prefer my outside offer if I don't negotiate, but I can't accept my outside offer unless I WALK. \\n    Since this is not the final round, let's try another counteroffer.\\n\\n    Let's try offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] which would leave me with [2, 7, 6, 5, 4].\\n    * Value of my counteroffer [2,7,6,5,4]:\\n        * Item 1: 2 * 67 = 134\\n        * Item 2: 7 * 89 = 623\\n        * Item 3: 6 * 3 = 18\\n        * Item 4: 5 * 7 = 35\\n        * Item 5: 4 * 11 = 44\\n        * Total Value: 134 + 623 + 18 + 35 + 44 = 854\\n\\n    The discounted value of this counteroffer is 854 * 0.9 = 768.6, which is still less than my discounted outside offer (769.5). But the difference is only very minor.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nAlthough my counter offer of taking all items yields a slightly lower discounted value than my outside offer, it would increase the chances that player 1 makes a counteroffer that I would value higher than my outside offer in the final round. Thus, it makes sense to counter offer.\\nI will offer player 1 the counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\\n\\n**Action:**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

So, there's no discount at this round.\\n\\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to formulate a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 773. My available items are:\\n    *   Item 1: 4\\n    *   Item 2: 4\\n    *   Item 3: 3\\n    *   Item 4: 7\\n    *   Item 5: 3\\n    To calculate the amount of items I keep for a given offer, I will subtract the offer given to player 1 from the total amount of each item.\\n\\n    I should try to get as many units as possible of the items I value the highest. Let's see what happens if I propose to take all units of item 2, all units of item 4, and some of item 5, as well as taking all of item 1 and item 3 that are not being offered to me. This means proposing to give the other player:\\n    *Item 1: 0\\n    *Item 2: 0\\n    *Item 3: 0\\n    *Item 4: 0\\n    *Item 5: 0\\n\\n   This means I would get:\\n    *   4 units of item 1: 4 * 22 = 88\\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 72 = 288\\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 36 = 108\\n    *   7 units of item 4: 7 * 67 = 469\\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 54 = 162\\n    *   Total value: 88+288+108+469+162 = 1117\\n\\n    This is much more than my outside offer. Therefore, I will make this my counteroffer.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nI should not accept the current offer because it is worth less than my outside offer. Since it is round one and there are still opportunities to negotiate, I should make a counteroffer which gives me a value higher than my outside offer.

This is worse than my outside offer.\\n*   **Value of possible counteroffers:** Since I get nothing under current offer, I need to calculate a potentially useful counteroffer. Because of round discount factor, it's best to aim for higher values than outside offer of 101 at this round. Let's evaluate a few options:\\n\\n    *   **Option 1: Keeping most high-value items (offer 1 unit of each):**\\n        *   My offer: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to player 2, resulting in my getting:\\n        *   Item 1: 3 units * 25 = 75\\n        *   Item 2: 3 units * 99 = 297\\n        *   Item 3: 2 units * 10 = 20\\n        *   Item 4: 6 units * 62 = 372\\n        *   Item 5: 2 units * 98 = 196\\n        *   Total: 960. This is significantly above my outside offer, but discount factor has to be considered. Since it is round 2, value is multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. Therefore, discounted value of accepting now is 960 * 0.9 = 864\\n    *  **Option 2: Try to get more items:**\\n          * My offer: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] to Player 2, resulting in my getting:\\n          * Item 1: 4 units * 25 = 100\\n          * Item 2: 4 units * 99 = 396\\n          * Item 3: 2 units * 10 = 20\\n          * Item 4: 7 units * 62 = 434\\n          * Item 5: 3 units * 98 = 294\\n          * Total: 1244. This is significantly above my outside offer. Discounted value would be 1244*0.9 = 1119.6\\n   * **Option 3: A very low offer (give most to other player):**\\n           * Offer [3, 3, 2, 6, 2] which gives me:\\n           * Item 1: 1 unit * 25 = 25\\n           * Item 2: 1 unit * 99 = 99\\n           * Item 3: 1 unit * 10 = 10\\n           * Item 4: 1 unit * 62 = 62\\n           * Item 5: 1 unit * 98 = 98\\n           * Total: 294. Discounted value is 294*0.9 = 264.6\\n          \\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor of 0.9 means that any deal made now is worth 90% of its total value. My outside offer remains at 101.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\n*   The current offer is terrible; accepting it gives a value of 0, way below the outside offer.\\n*   I definitely shouldn't walk away at this point since I can do better.\\n*   I should make a counteroffer that gives me good items. Option 2 looks promising, as it has good overall value.\\n* I will therefore offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] to Player 2.\\n\\n**Action:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

There is no offer on the table.\\n*   **Round:** 1\\n*   **Discount factor (gamma):** 0.9\\n\\n**2) Calculate potential values:**\\n\\nSince there is no current offer, I need to consider making an initial counteroffer.  My goal is to maximize my value, keeping in mind that there are 3 rounds in total, and a discount factor of 0.9 will apply to each round. I want an offer that is greater than my outside offer of 716.\\nI need to determine the best counteroffer to make.\\n\\nHere's how I can proceed:\\n1.  Calculate the maximum value that is available to me:\\n     - Item 1: 3 * 53 = 159\\n     - Item 2: 2 * 8 = 16\\n     - Item 3: 5 * 38 = 190\\n     - Item 4: 6 * 46 = 276\\n     - Item 5: 4 * 96 = 384\\n     - Total maximum value = 159 + 16 + 190 + 276 + 384 = 1025\\n\\n2.  I want to try to get as close to my maximum as possible, but to do that, I will need to offer Player 2 something of value. I will propose that I receive 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 3 of item 5 and offer the remaining items to Player 2. This calculation is as follows:\\n    - Item 1: 2 * 53 = 106\\n    - Item 2: 1 * 8 = 8\\n    - Item 3: 3 * 38 = 114\\n    - Item 4: 4 * 46 = 184\\n    - Item 5: 3 * 96 = 288\\n    - Total offer value to myself = 106+8+114+184+288=700\\n\\nThis offer is less than my outside offer of 716. Therefore, it is not the ideal action at this time.\\n\\n3.  I will propose that I receive all of items 3, 4 and 5 and offer the rest to Player 2. This calculation is as follows:\\n    - Item 1: 0 * 53 = 0\\n    - Item 2: 0 * 8 = 0\\n    - Item 3: 5 * 38 = 190\\n    - Item 4: 6 * 46 = 276\\n    - Item 5: 4 * 96 = 384\\n    - Total offer value to myself = 190 + 276 + 384 = 850\\n\\nThis offer is greater than my outside offer, which is good. The offer to Player 2 is to receive 3 of item 1 and 2 of item 2.\\n\\n4.  Consider the other extreme. If I keep all items for myself the value is:\\n    - Item 1: 3 * 53 = 159\\n    - Item 2: 2 * 8 = 16\\n    - Item 3: 5 * 38 = 190\\n    - Item 4: 6 * 46 = 276\\n    - Item 5: 4 * 96 = 384\\n    - Total offer value to myself = 159 + 16 + 190 + 276 + 384 = 1025\\n\\nThis is the maximum value I could receive, which is significantly above my outside offer, however, it is not a practical initial offer.\\n\\n**3) Decide:**\\n\\nSince there is no current offer and it is the first round, I should make a counteroffer that provides a high value to myself, whilst not being too greedy to avoid Player 2 automatically WALKing away. My total value of keeping items 3,4 and 5 is 850, which is greater than my outside offer and should be a reasonably acceptable initial offer. I propose that Player 2 receive 3 of item 1 and 2 of item 2, with the rest coming to me.\\n\\n**Action:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 5, 6, 4]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

Discounted value = 102 * 0.9 = 91.8.\\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer value is 162, which is higher than the discounted value of accepting the current offer (91.8). Therefore, if there is no deal it is better for me to walk than to accept the current offer.\\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what counteroffer would give me a higher discounted value than 162. Let's try to get as much as possible of the high value items. I have 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, and 5 of item 3.\\n\\n    * **Option 1:** I keep all high value items. I offer player 1 [0,0,0,6,4] - I keep [3,2,5,0,0]. This has value to me 3 * 81 + 2 * 100 + 5 * 76 = 243+200+380 = 823. Discounted: 0.9 * 823 = 740.7. This is much higher than my outside offer.\\n\\n    * **Option 2:** I keep most of my valuable items. I offer [0,0,3,6,4]. I keep [3,2,2,0,0]. This has value 3 * 81 + 2 * 100 + 2*76 = 243 + 200 + 152 = 595. Discounted: 0.9 * 595 = 535.5. Still much higher than my outside offer.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nSince the discounted value of accepting the current offer is only 91.8, which is much less than my outside offer of 162, I should not accept the current offer.\\n\\nSince I have another round, it is better to make a counteroffer, since the discount factor might make it better to accept a suboptimal offer next round. I want as much of the valuable items as possible, but I also want this offer to potentially be accepted next round, so I won't offer [0,0,0,6,4].\\n\\nI will choose to offer Player 1 [0,0,3,6,4] and keep [3,2,2,0,0]. This has discounted value 535.5, much greater than my outside offer.\\n\\n**Action:**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 3, 6, 4]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

I need to consider that I have 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5 available to divide.\\n\\nLet's consider some possible scenarios:\\n\\n*   **Scenario 1: Keep everything for myself**\\n    *   6 units of item 1: 6 * 40 = 240\\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 98 = 294\\n    *   9 units of item 3: 9 * 94 = 846\\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 49 = 147\\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 62 = 0\\n    *   Total Value: 240 + 294 + 846 + 147 + 0 = 1527\\n    This scenario is very greedy, however it sets an upper bound to what I could possibly achieve.\\n\\n*  **Scenario 2: A simple equal split, if possible:**\\n    *   Item 1: 3 units (6 total, divide by 2)\\n    *   Item 2: 1.5 units. Since this is not possible, let's consider 1 unit or 2 units\\n    *   Item 3: 4.5 units. Since this is not possible, let's consider 4 units or 5 units\\n    *   Item 4: 1.5 units. Since this is not possible, let's consider 1 unit or 2 units\\n    *   Item 5: 0 units, so no split\\n    Let us try a possible offer which is fair: \\n        Player 2 Gets:\\n        *   3 units of item 1\\n        *   1 unit of item 2\\n        *   4 units of item 3\\n        *   1 unit of item 4\\n        *   0 units of item 5\\n\\n        I keep:\\n        *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 40 = 120\\n        *   2 unit of item 2: 2 * 98 = 196\\n        *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 94 = 470\\n        *   2 unit of item 4: 2 * 49 = 98\\n        *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 62 = 0\\n    *   Total Value: 120 + 196 + 470 + 98 + 0 = 884. This is greater than my outside offer of 495.\\n\\n*   **Scenario 3: Offer a bit more to player 2**:\\n        Let us try a possible offer which is generous: \\n        Player 2 Gets:\\n        *   4 units of item 1\\n        *   2 unit of item 2\\n        *   5 units of item 3\\n        *   2 unit of item 4\\n        *   0 units of item 5\\n\\n        I keep:\\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 40 = 80\\n        *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 98 = 98\\n        *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 94 = 376\\n        *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 49 = 49\\n        *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 62 = 0\\n    *   Total Value: 80 + 98 + 376 + 49 + 0 = 603. This is greater than my outside offer of 495.\\n\\nConsidering the above, it seems a reasonable opening offer would be to give player 2 a bit more, to avoid an immediate walk.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nSince this is round 1, I don't have any offers to accept. It makes sense to propose a first offer.  I will offer the slightly generous offer:\\n\\n    *   4 units of item 1\\n    *   2 unit of item 2\\n    *   5 units of item 3\\n    *   2 unit of item 4\\n    *   0 units of item 5\\n\\nThis leaves me with a value of 603 which is above my outside offer of 495.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [4, 2, 5, 2, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

A counteroffer of [0,0,0,0,0] maximises my value.\\n\\n**Action:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

My aim here is to make an offer that would give me a value equal to or above my outside offer. There are a limited number of units. Let's assume my counteroffer gives player 1 as little as possible, which means I'm asking to keep all the items I can that provide me with the greatest value given the limited amount. I have 2 of item 1, 8 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 4 of item 5.\\n\\n    Let's start with an offer of giving player 1 nothing of the high value items - 3 and 4 and then give the other items (1, 2, 5). My highest value items are 3, 4, 1 and 5 and then 2.\\n  \\n    *  Giving away 0 of item 1 means I keep 2 units * 59 = 118\\n    *  Giving away 0 of item 2 means I keep 8 units * 31 = 248\\n    *  Giving away 0 of item 3 means I keep 5 units * 68 = 340\\n    *  Giving away 0 of item 4 means I keep 1 unit * 67 = 67\\n    *  Giving away 0 of item 5 means I keep 4 units * 57 = 228\\n    *   Total value of keeping all items is 118 + 248 + 340 + 67 + 228 = 1001\\n\\n    *  Let's try giving away some items with the lowest value first. I will give items 1,2,5. I will give player 1 all of item 1 (2 units), item 2 (8 units) and item 5 (4 units) and keep all of items 3 and 4.\\n    * Giving away 2 of item 1 means I keep 0 units * 59 = 0\\n    * Giving away 8 of item 2 means I keep 0 units * 31 = 0\\n    * Giving away 0 of item 3 means I keep 5 units * 68 = 340\\n    * Giving away 0 of item 4 means I keep 1 unit * 67 = 67\\n    * Giving away 4 of item 5 means I keep 0 units * 57 = 0\\n    * Total value of this offer for me: 340+67 = 407. This is not higher than my walk away option, so I'll try keeping as many of the higher value items as possible.\\n    \\n    I will try keeping all of items 3 and 4 and then as much of the others as possible.\\n\\n    * Give away 0 of item 3 = keep 5 * 68 = 340\\n    * Give away 0 of item 4 = keep 1 * 67 = 67\\n    * Now, lets give the remainder to player 1 - 2 of item 1, 8 of item 2, 4 of item 5.\\n    * Total Value to me = 340+67 = 407. This is not a good offer for me. \\n\\n    Let's try one more, give player 1 the low-value item 2 and keep the rest.\\n\\n    * Give away 0 of item 1 = keep 2 * 59 = 118\\n    * Give away 8 of item 2 = keep 0 * 31 = 0\\n    * Give away 0 of item 3 = keep 5 * 68 = 340\\n    * Give away 0 of item 4 = keep 1 * 67 = 67\\n    * Give away 0 of item 5 = keep 4 * 57 = 228\\n    * Total Value for me = 118 + 340 + 67 + 228 = 753. Still not higher than outside offer.\\n\\n    Let's try keeping items 1, 3 and 4 and giving away 2 and 5\\n\\n   *   Give away 0 of item 1 = keep 2 * 59 = 118\\n    *  Give away 8 of item 2 = keep 0 * 31 = 0\\n    *  Give away 0 of item 3 = keep 5 * 68 = 340\\n    *  Give away 0 of item 4 = keep 1 * 67 = 67\\n    *   Give away 4 of item 5 = keep 0 * 57 = 0\\n   *  Total value = 118 + 340 + 67 = 525 - still no good.\\n\\n    Let's try giving Player 1 0 of everything.\\n\\n    *   Give away 0 of item 1 = keep 2 * 59 = 118\\n    *  Give away 0 of item 2 = keep 8 * 31 = 248\\n    *  Give away 0 of item 3 = keep 5 * 68 = 340\\n    *  Give away 0 of item 4 = keep 1 * 67 = 67\\n    *   Give away 0 of item 5 = keep 4 * 57 = 228\\n   *  Total value = 118+248+340+67+228 = 1001\\n   \\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nSince the value of the current offer (286) is less than my outside offer (971), I should not accept. I will make a counter offer where I request all of the items which results in a value of 1001, higher than my outside offer, and since it is round 1, discounted value is 1001. My counteroffer is to take all of the items, which means offering the other player 0 of each item.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

Value would be:\\n        (2 * 75) + (7 * 86) + (4 * 19) + (1 * 18) + (3 * 49) = 150 + 602 + 76 + 18 + 147 = 993\\n*   **Discount Factor:** Since it's round 2, any deal will be multiplied by gamma^(2-1) which is 0.9^1=0.9. My outside offer will also be multiplied by this. \\n    *   Discounted outside offer: 633 * 0.9 = 569.7\\n\\n**3) Decide:**\\n\\n*   **Accept current offer:**  No way. My value is 0, which is significantly lower than my discounted outside offer.\\n*   **Walk away:** My discounted outside offer value is 569.7.  If my best counteroffer leads to a value greater than my outside offer, I should make the counteroffer.\\n*   **Counteroffer:** Offering Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] gives me the highest value (1147) so this is the best outcome for me. This is greater than my outside offer of 633. Applying the discount factor, we have 1147*0.9 = 1032.3 which is greater than 569.7.

Note that I have 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5, so any offer I make to player 2 must be less than or equal to these.\\n\\n*   **Counteroffer 1: Offering Player 2 nothing**\\n    *   I keep all the items\\n    *   Value = (2 * 41) + (1 * 15) + (2 * 72) + (5 * 84) + (4 * 96) = 82 + 15 + 144 + 420 + 384 = 1045\\n    *   Discounted value = 1045 * 0.9^(1-1) = 1045\\n    *   This is much higher than my outside offer.\\n\\n*   **Counteroffer 2: A balanced offer, giving 1 unit of each item except item 2 to Player 2.**\\n    *   I keep 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. Player 2 will get 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\\n    *   Value to me = (1 * 41) + (0 * 15) + (1 * 72) + (4 * 84) + (3 * 96) = 41 + 0 + 72 + 336 + 288 = 737\\n    *   Discounted value = 737 * 0.9^(1-1) = 737\\n    *   This is lower than my outside offer, so not a great strategy\\n\\n* **Counteroffer 3: A slightly greedy offer**\\n    *   I keep 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. Giving 0 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5 to player 2.\\n    *   Value to me = (2 * 41) + (1 * 15) + (2 * 72) + (4 * 84) + (3 * 96) = 82 + 15 + 144 + 336 + 288 = 865\\n    *   Discounted value = 865 * 0.9^(1-1) = 865\\n    *   This is greater than my outside offer.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nSince it's the first round, and I have no current offer to accept, walking away would mean I get my outside offer immediately. It would be irrational to walk when making a counter offer in round 1 is possible. I see that counteroffer 1, while potentially leading to a rejection and further negotiations in later rounds, has a much higher value to me. However, it might be seen as an unfair offer and cause a rejection by the other player. I will make a slightly less greedy offer, counteroffer 3 which gives the other player some value whilst still being better than my outside offer.\\n\\n**My Action:**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

I will propose a counteroffer where I give 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2.

Let me try to get more value, I can't propose a counteroffer that does not give anything to Player 2, so I'll offer them 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5.\\n    *   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 41 = 82\\n    *   1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 15 = 15\\n    *   2 units of item 3 = 2 * 72 = 144\\n    *   5 unit of item 4 = 5 * 84 = 420\\n    *   3 units of item 5 = 3 * 96 = 288\\n    *   Total value = 82+15+144+420+288 = 949\\n    *   Discounted Value = 949 * 0.9 = 854.1\\n\\n    This discounted value exceeds my outside offer value.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\n*   Accepting the current offer gives me a discounted value of 162, which is much lower than my outside offer.\\n*   Walking away gives me a value of 838.\\n*   I propose giving the player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] which results in a discounted value of 854.1, which is higher than my outside offer.\\n\\nTherefore, I should make the counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1].\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

Since I want to maximize my value it is better to keep as many of the highest valued items to myself, and offer more of the low value items to player 1. Since I have item 4 with the highest value of 96, it is unlikely that I can get more of this item if I counteroffer. Let's consider keeping everything I have in the current offer and also see if I can get more of item 4.\\n\\nMy resources are:\\nItem 1: 2 units\\nItem 2: 7 units\\nItem 3: 4 units\\nItem 4: 2 units\\nItem 5: 7 units\\n\\nIf I counteroffer by asking for the remaining items I have, this will mean that player 1 gets very little, so is unlikely to accept. This will mean that I walk away on the next round. Let's make a conservative counteroffer to see if player 1 accepts.\\nIf player 1 offered me 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, then this means that player 1 is keeping 1, 5, 3, 1, 5 respectively. If I keep 1, 2, 1, 1, 2 and offer 1, 5, 3, 1, 5 this means the same split. Since I value item 4 most, let's counteroffer by asking for more of item 4 while still offering player 1 reasonable amounts. I will try to keep as many of item 4 as I can and offer more of item 5 instead.\\nI will try to give player 1 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 as my counteroffer.\\nThis means I get:\\nItem 1: 1 * 81 = 81\\nItem 2: 4 * 68 = 272\\nItem 3: 2 * 81 = 162\\nItem 4: 2 * 96 = 192\\nItem 5: 3 * 24 = 72\\nTotal Value: 779\\nDiscounted Value: 779 * 0.9 = 701.1\\n\\nThis is way better than the current offer and my outside offer. Let's try and push more.\\nIf player 1 offered me 1, 2, 1, 1, 2. Lets try giving player 1 the lowest value items while I keep the highest ones.\\nPlayer 1 gets: 2 unit of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\\nI get: 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\\nMy value: 0 + 2 * 68 + 81 + 2 * 96 + 2 * 24 = 136 + 81 + 192 + 48 = 457. Discounted value = 411.3. This is not as good as keeping the current offer.\\n\\nLet's see what we get if we try to get all of item 4 while making the minimum changes:\\nIf Player 1 gets: 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 4 unit of item 5\\nI get: 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5\\nMy value: 81 + 4*68 + 2*81 + 2*96 + 3*24 = 81 + 272 + 162 + 192 + 72 = 779. Discounted value = 701.1\\n\\nSince this is the second round, I should expect that player 1 will be expecting a similar offer or slightly worse.\\n\\n**3) Decide:**\\n\\nThe best option seems to accept the current offer. I will ACCEPT since this gives the best outcome for this round.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"ACCEPT\\\"}\\n```\\n\"\n",

Discounted value of walking away is 778 * 0.9 = 700.2\\n\\n*   **Considering potential counteroffers:** It's useful to think about how I value each item. The most valuable to me is item 2 and the least valuable is item 4. Since the other player has requested to keep one unit of each, my best outcome is to try to get the rest, except for item 4, since that value is so low to me. If I don't get the maximum, my counteroffer needs to be valued higher than 700.2 or else walking away is better.

Therefore, the discount for this round is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\\n\\n**2) Calculate Values:**\\n\\n*   **Value of Accepting Current Offer:**\\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 94 = 94\\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 87 = 87\\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 54 = 54\\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 96 = 96\\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 92 = 92\\n    *   Total value without discount = 94 + 87 + 54 + 96 + 92 = 423\\n    *   Total value with discount = 423 * 0.9 = 380.7\\n\\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to figure out what values I could achieve from a counteroffer.  The key here is that the total value in the deal, including player 1's value, is not discounted.  However, a better deal for me is only worth pursuing if *my* discounted value is better than walking away.\\n\\n    *   **Going for everything (or most things) is optimal in this round if I want a deal.** If I want to be greedy and make a good offer, I need to consider what is left for Player 1. Given there are 7 units of item 1, 2 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 5 of item 5 total, if I offer Player 1 0 of every item I could collect:\\n        * 7 of item 1 = 7 * 94 = 658\\n        * 2 of item 2 = 2 * 87 = 174\\n        * 5 of item 3 = 5 * 54 = 270\\n        * 4 of item 4 = 4 * 96 = 384\\n        * 5 of item 5 = 5 * 92 = 460\\n        * Total value without discount = 658 + 174 + 270 + 384 + 460 = 1946\\n        * Total value with discount = 1946 * 0.9 = 1751.4\\n\\n    * If I offer the bare minimum [0,0,0,0,0] my offer will get rejected. I also know I should not offer less than player 1 has offered (1 of each). I should try to maximise the value I receive while still offering the other player a meaningful value.\\n\\n    * If I were to take an offer where I get a lot and the other player still gets something, for example, I get 6 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 4 of item 5, and player 1 gets 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. \\n        * 6 of item 1 = 6 * 94 = 564\\n        * 1 of item 2 = 1 * 87 = 87\\n        * 4 of item 3 = 4 * 54 = 216\\n        * 3 of item 4 = 3 * 96 = 288\\n        * 4 of item 5 = 4 * 92 = 368\\n        * Total value without discount = 564 + 87 + 216 + 288 + 368 = 1523\\n        * Total value with discount = 1523 * 0.9 = 1370.7\\n\\n        *The offer to the other player would be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]*\\n   \\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\\n    * Accepting the current offer gives a value of 380.7 which is less than my outside offer of 868.\\n    * Trying to take all items yields an offer with a discounted value of 1751.4, which is higher than walking away.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\n*   Accepting the current offer is not optimal, as it is far below my outside offer value, and it is also lower than what I could achieve.\\n*   Walking away is not optimal since I could get a better deal\\n*   My optimal course of action is to make a counteroffer and try to achieve a better deal\\n\\nI will try a greedy counteroffer where I take almost everything. This should lead to me receiving more than my outside offer value, though I will give the other player at least what they last offered. This means that I will offer player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\\n\\n**Action:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

Here is a breakdown of the value of all items:\\n    * 8 Units of Item 1: Value to me per unit 48\\n    * 2 Units of Item 2: Value to me per unit 27\\n    * 2 Units of Item 3: Value to me per unit 13\\n    * 2 Units of Item 4: Value to me per unit 80\\n    * 4 Units of Item 5: Value to me per unit 94\\n   Item 5 is by far the most valuable for me, followed by item 4, then item 1, then item 2, then item 3.\\n     \\nI will try to secure all of item 5 and item 4, and most of item 1, and give my opponent most of the lower value items. \\n\\nLet's try offering the opponent: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.

Since we are in round 2, and the value of acceptance is already below the outside offer, we need to be very careful with our counteroffer.

Let us propose a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] meaning that I keep [8, 2, 2, 2, 4].\\n     * Value for this offer to me: 8 * 9 + 2 * 46 + 2 * 77 + 2 * 99 + 4 * 3 = 72 + 92 + 154 + 198 + 12 = 528. Discounted value: 528 * 0.9 = 475.2.\\n    * Let's consider another counteroffer. I want to take as much as I can, and I value items 4, 3, and 2 in that order. Let's offer them [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This would mean that I keep [4, 2, 2, 2, 4].\\n        *  Value for this to me: 4 * 9 + 2 * 46 + 2 * 77 + 2 * 99 + 4 * 3 = 36 + 92 + 154 + 198 + 12 = 492. Discounted Value: 492 * 0.9 = 442.8. \\n    * Let's try offering them [4, 2, 2, 2, 4]. This would mean I keep [4, 0, 0, 0, 0].\\n        * Value for this offer to me: 4*9 = 36. Discounted value: 36 * 0.9 = 32.4\\n    * Let's try offering them [8, 2, 2, 0, 0]. This means I keep [0, 0, 0, 2, 4].\\n        * Value for this offer to me: 2*99 + 4*3 = 198 + 12 = 210. Discounted value: 210*0.9 = 189.\\n    * Let's try offering them [8, 2, 2, 2, 0]. This means I keep [0, 0, 0, 0, 4].\\n        * Value for this offer to me: 4*3 = 12. Discounted value: 12 * 0.9 = 10.8\\n\\n    It looks like keeping all items for myself and offering nothing [0,0,0,0,0] is the best option to pursue from my perspective.\\n\\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\\n    *   Accepting the current offer would give me 0, which is far below my outside offer of 960.\\n    *   My best counteroffer (keeping everything for myself) has a discounted value of 475.2 which is also far below my outside offer of 960.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\nSince we're in round 2, making a counteroffer will allow me to keep negotiating. However, making a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer will not be possible within this framework. However, it is my best move in this situation. My best counter offer is to offer nothing [0,0,0,0,0]. If it's rejected, I get my outside offer in round 3 at a discounted value of 960 * 0.9^2 = 777.6. If we come to a deal based on this counter offer I get 475.2\\n\\n**Action:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

I want to maximize my value, so I should aim to keep the items I value most.\\n        *   **Counteroffer 1: Keeping most items I value:** Let's try keeping almost all of items 4 and 5. So, we'll propose giving away 0 units of items 1, 2, and 3, 0 unit of item 4 and 0 of item 5. This would mean offering to player 2 [8, 2, 2, 2, 4] (all of each item). My value will be 0, which is not useful.\\n        *   **Counteroffer 2: Keeping 7 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 3 of item 5:** That means I give Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This gives me:\\n            *   7 \\\\* 48 + 1 \\\\* 27 + 1 \\\\* 13 + 2 \\\\* 80 + 3 \\\\* 94 = 336 + 27 + 13 + 160 + 282 = 818. \\n        *   **Counteroffer 3: Keeping 6 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5:** That means I give Player 2 [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]. This gives me:\\n            *   6 \\\\* 48 + 0 \\\\* 27 + 0 \\\\* 13 + 1 \\\\* 80 + 2 \\\\* 94 = 288 + 0 + 0 + 80 + 188 = 556\\n        *   **Counteroffer 4: Keeping everything and giving nothing to Player 2:** That means I give Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This gives me:\\n            *   8 \\\\* 48 + 2 \\\\* 27 + 2 \\\\* 13 + 2 \\\\* 80 + 4 \\\\* 94 = 384 + 54 + 26 + 160 + 376 = 1000\\n\\n*   **Discount Factor Impact:** The discount factor (0.9) is multiplied by the negotiation outcome value raised to the power of (round-1). The current round is 3, so the discount factor is 0.9^2 = 0.81.\\n\\n**3) Decision:**\\n\\n*   Accepting the current offer will give me 0, which is far below my discounted outside offer of 691.74\\n*   Walking away gets me 691.74.\\n*   Making a counteroffer that will get me a value of more than 691.74 is my best course of action. Counteroffer 2 yields a value of 818, and Counteroffer 4 yields 1000. Since it is the final round, if I make a counteroffer that Player 2 does not accept, the negotiation will end and I will be worse off than if I had walked away. I should offer a proposal that is better than nothing to Player 2, that is also of greater value to me than walking away. Therefore, Counteroffer 2 seems like the best choice. My discounted value for making this counteroffer is 818 * 0.81 = 662.51. This is worse than walking away. Therefore, I should go with the last counteroffer as this gets me the most value if player 2 agrees. If player 2 does not agree, I walk away.\\nTherefore I should propose counteroffer 4.\\n\\n**Action:**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

This would give me a value of 0 which is obviously less than my outside offer so this is not a good plan.\\n    *   **Scenario 2:** I offer Player 1 half of the total items and keep half of each item: Since there are 3 units of item 1, I would offer 1 and keep 2; 2 units of item 2 I would offer 1 and keep 1; 2 units of item 3 I would offer 1 and keep 1; 6 units of item 4 I would offer 3 and keep 3; 5 units of item 5, I would offer 2 and keep 3; so I would make a counteroffer [1,1,1,3,2].
