One strong move might be to try to allocate more of the high-value items (for me) to myself.\\n\\nProposal: \\n- I get all 3 units of item 1, as it gives me a high value.\\n- I offer 0 units of item 2, as it\\u2019s indifferent relatively.\\n- I get all 4 units of item 3, because it offers a high value.\\n- I propose 0 units of item 4 and 0 of item 5, prioritizing higher-value items for me.\\n\\n**Counteroffer Calculation:**\\n- 3 units of item 1: \\\\(3 \\\\times 90 = 270\\\\)\\n- 0 units of item 2: \\\\(0 \\\\times 35 = 0\\\\)\\n- 4 units of item 3: \\\\(4 \\\\times 74 = 296\\\\)\\n- 3 units of item 4: \\\\(0 \\\\times 67 = 0\\\\)\\n- 7 units of item 5: \\\\(1 \\\\times 0 = 0\\\\) (I originally considered just high value ones, but let's fit within all available)\\n\\nTotal value of this proposal to me: 566, which is greater than my outside offer of 449.\\n\\nCounteroffer: [2, 2, 0, 2, 7] (meaning I offer these units to Player 0, aiming to keep others) \\n\\nEnsuring it's valid without using counteroffer more units than I can, we adjust the boundaries just in case**\\n\\nFinal adjusted counteroffer to ensure no player walk is:\\n\\nCounteroffer: [3, 2, 0, 3, 7]\\n\\nTherefore, my optimal action in this round is to provide a counteroffer:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [3, 2, 0, 3, 7]}\\n```\",\n",

Here's a potential offer I'd like to consider making to Player 1:\\n\\n**Offer Proposal:**\\n- I keep:\\n  - 4 units of item 1 (240 value)\\n  - 4 units of item 2 (248 value)\\n  - 3 units of item 3 (183 value)\\n  - 2 units of item 4 (58 value)\\n  - 3 units of item 5 (267 value)\\n- Total value for me = 240 + 248 + 183 + 58 + 267 = 996\\n\\nI realize offering this will keep my value (996) slightly below the outside offer (1012). Thus, I need to adjust to at least equal or exceed the outside offer. Let's adjust by keeping more of item 5:\\n\\n**Revised Offer Proposal:**\\n- I keep:\\n  - 5 units of item 1 (300 value)\\n  - 5 units of item 2 (310 value)\\n  - 3 units of item 3 (183 value)\\n  - 3 units of item 4 (87 value)\\n  - 2 units of item 5 (178 value)\\n  \\n- Total value for me = 300 + 310 + 183 + 87 + 178 = 1058\\n\\nThis proposal gives me a value of 1058, which exceeds my outside offer of 1012, satisfying my objective to maximize my payoff beyond what I'd receive by walking away. Therefore, I will make the following counteroffer:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [1, 3, 2, 1, 2]}\\n```\",\n",

I should avoid Mistake 4 (Accepting an offer worse for me than my outside offer).\\n\\n### Counteroffer Consideration:\\nI will try to construct a counteroffer that has a value greater than 391. Here is a possible allocation:\\n\\nLet's consider keeping all of item 3 (high value) and some of item 1 and 5, while compromising on items 2 and 4.\\n\\n- I will offer Player 1:\\n  - 2 units of item 2\\n  - 1 units of item 4\\n\\n### Counteroffer Structure\\n- My counteroffer to Player 1: [2, 2, 0, 1, 0]\\n  - I keep:\\n    - 0 units of item 1, Total: 0 \\u00d7 60 = 0\\n    - 6 units of item 2, Total: 6 \\u00d7 11 = 66\\n    - 1 unit of item 3, Total: 1 \\u00d7 92 = 92\\n    - 1 unit of item 4, Total: 1 \\u00d7 19 = 19\\n    - 2 units of item 5, Total: 2 \\u00d7 85 = 170\\n\\n### Total Value of This Counteroffer:\\n- Total value kept by me = 0 (item 1) + 66 (item 2) + 92 (item 3) + 19 (item 4) + 170 (item 5) = 347\\n\\nAlthough my new counteroffer gives a smaller value than my outside offer, it might still be beneficial given the dynamic and if concessions from Player 1 lead to a better offer in subsequent rounds with discount factor taken into account. But it's prudent to push for a slightly higher share in high-value items (item 3 and 5) to make sure future negotiations include potential room to increase value further. \\n\\nUnfortunately, this offer remains less than 391. I need to increase value around high-value items strategically.\\n\\nGiven the high value required to surpass 391, and the inability to reach it directly, I should position my offers to slightly extract better terms with potential future offers in mind.\\n\\nLet's counteroffer with a slightly higher, strategically calculated offer given the space to negotiate further: [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]\\n\\n### Total Value of Adjusted Counteroffer:\\n- Values kept by me = 1 \\u00d7 60 (item 1) + 6 \\u00d7 11 (item 2) + 1 \\u00d7 92 (item 3) + 1 \\u00d7 19 (item 4) + 0 \\u00d7 85 (item 5) \\n- New Total Value = 60 + 66 + 92 + 19 + 170 = 407\\n\\nThe adjusted counter offer now makes my payoff just above my outside offer while avoiding Mistake 2 and providing future negotiation potential.\\n\\nTherefore, I propose:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]}\\n```\",\n",

Keep more of the higher value items and offer the lower value items:\\n   - Keeping all 3 units of item 3 and item 4 provides high value due to my high valuation (85 and 68 respectively).\\n   - I could then consider offering more of item 2 as it has the lowest value to me.\\n\\n2. Calculate the value for keeping certain quantities:\\n   - I propose giving 3 units of item 2 to Player 1 as it has the lowest value (3 x 14 = 42).\\n   - Offer 1 unit of item 1 as it still provides a modest value (1 x 57 = 57).\\n   - Retain all units of items 3, 4, and 5 for themselves as they are high-value items to me.\\n\\nCalculate the value of the items I plan to retain:\\n- Retain 5 units of item 1: 5 x 57 = 285\\n- Retain all units of item 3: 3 x 85 = 255\\n- Retain all units of item 4: 3 x 68 = 204\\n- Retain all units of item 5: 2 x 62 = 124\\n\\nTotal retained value = 285 + 255 + 204 + 124 = 868\\n\\nThe retained value (868) is significantly greater than my outside offer (228), making this an acceptable initial offer. The values I propose to offer should be reasonable to the opponent without leaving me at a disadvantage.\\n\\nTherefore, my initial offer will be: \\n- Give 1 unit of item 1\\n- Give 3 units of item 2\\n- Give 0 units for items 3, 4, 5\\n\\nThis translates to a counteroffer of: [1, 3, 0, 0, 0]\\n\\nThus, my action is:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [1, 3, 0, 0, 0]}\\n```\",\n",

Our aim is to retain items that have the highest value per unit for us.\\n\\nHere's a breakdown of what the negotiation items are worth to us for the total available units:\\n\\n- Item 1: 3 units \\u00d7 41 = 123\\n- Item 2: 4 units \\u00d7 2 = 8\\n- Item 3: 3 units \\u00d7 84 = 252\\n- Item 4: 3 units \\u00d7 28 = 84\\n- Item 5: 4 units \\u00d7 97 = 388\\n\\nWe want to ensure that the leftover items we keep will have a value greater than or equal to the outside offer of 142. The total value of all items we could receive is 855. Subtracting our outside offer from this total value gives us a room of 713 to distribute to the other player.\\n\\nTo maximize our value, we'll prioritize keeping more of the high-value items for ourselves. Here is a proposed initial offer:\\n\\n1. Give away 0 units of item 1 (we keep 3 units, value to us: 123)\\n2. Give away 4 units of item 2 (we keep 0 units, value to us: 0)\\n3. Give away 1 unit of item 3 (we keep 2 units, value to us: 168)\\n4. Give away 1 unit of item 4 (we keep 2 units, value to us: 56)\\n5. Give away 1 unit of item 5 (we keep 3 units, value to us: 291)\\n\\nThe value of items we'd keep with this offer:\\n\\n- 3 units of item 1 = 123\\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0\\n- 2 units of item 3 = 168\\n- 2 units of item 4 = 56\\n- 3 units of item 5 = 291\\n\\nTotal value = 123 + 0 + 168 + 56 + 291 = 638\\n\\nThis value is significantly higher than our outside offer value of 142. Thus, this offer is reasonable and advantageous for us.
