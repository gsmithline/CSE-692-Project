      "    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n",

      "       - What are the values of the items involved?\n",
      "       - What is the total pool of items?\n",
      "       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n",

      "       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n",
      "       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n",
      "       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n",
      "\n",
      "    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n",
      "       - Should I accept the current offer?\n",

      "       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n",

      "    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n",
      "    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n",
      "    These mistakes are:\n",
      "    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n",
      "    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n",
      "    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n",
      "    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n",
      "    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n",
      "\n",
      "    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n",
      "    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 4, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n",
      "    68 x 0 + 37 x 3 + 82 x 4 + 4 x 1 + 46 x 5\n",
      "    which is 673 (sum of all item values)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    which is less than your outside offer of 674. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n",
      "    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n",

Delaying acceptance potentially reduces the value to both parties.\\n\\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\\n\\n- **Current Offer (Items being offered to me):** [1, 3, 2, 4, 3]\\n  - Value to me if I accept:\\n    - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 21 = 21\\n    - 3 units of item 2: 3 * 76 = 228\\n    - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 36 = 72\\n    - 4 units of item 4: 4 * 79 = 316\\n    - 3 units of item 5: 3 * 59 = 177\\n  - Total Value: 21 + 228 + 72 + 316 + 177 = 814\\n\\nThe current offer to me is worth 814, which is significantly lower than my outside offer value of 1164. Accepting the current offer would be a mistake since it provides less than my guaranteed fallback position.\\n\\n### Step 3: Decision Making\\n\\n- **Should I Accept?** \\n  - No, because the current offer value (814) is less than my outside offer value (1164).\\n\\n- **Should I Walk Away?**\\n  - Not immediately, as I may be able to propose a better counteroffer that meets or exceeds my outside offer value.\\n\\n- **Should I Propose a Counteroffer?**\\n  - Yes, I should craft a counteroffer which increases the value of items I keep to match or exceed my outside offer value of 1164.\\n\\n### Counteroffer Calculation\\n\\nTo achieve a total value of at least 1164, I need to retain a portion of the items that sum up to that value or more. Let's experiment with an offer configuration that provides better value to me.\\n\\nLet's propose keeping:\\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 * 21 = 63\\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 * 76 = 304\\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 * 36 = 108\\n- 5 units of item 4: 5 * 79 = 395\\n- 5 units of item 5: 5 * 59 = 295\\n\\nTotal Value: 63 + 304 + 108 + 395 + 295 = 1165\\n\\nThis proposed distribution gives me 1165, slightly exceeding my outside offer value.\\n\\nTherefore, I will make the following counteroffer:\\n\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [1, 2, 2, 0, 2]}\",\n",

Given this situation, I should either walk away or propose a counteroffer that yields a higher value than 1288 for myself.\\n\\n#### Counteroffer Proposal\\n\\nTo make a counteroffer, I need to ensure it results in higher than 1288 value:\\n\\nLet's formulate a counteroffer by keeping high-value items with me:\\n\\n- Propose giving: [0, 0, 4, 0, 1]\\n  - Keep:\\n    - 6 units of item 1 = 6 \\u00d7 42 = 252\\n    - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \\u00d7 77 = 308\\n    - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \\u00d7 14 = 56\\n    - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \\u00d7 100 = 400\\n    - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \\u00d7 53 = 265\\n\\n- Total value if kept = 252 + 308 + 56 + 400 + 265 = 1281\\n\\nHowever, this total of 1281 is still slightly under 1288.

      "    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n",
      "    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n",
      "    These mistakes are:\n",
      "    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n",
      "    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n",

      "    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n",
      "    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n",
      "\n",
      "    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n",
      "    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 3, 6, 4, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n",

      "    \n",
      "    which is less than your outside offer of 1288. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n",

Yes, I should propose a counteroffer that ensures I have a value equal to or greater than my outside offer (751).\\n\\nLet's propose a counteroffer: I'll present an offer where the items left for me give a minimum value close to 751 or higher if possible.

      "    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n",
      "    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n",
      "    These mistakes are:\n",
      "    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n",

      "    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n",
      "    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n",
      "\n",
      "    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n",
      "    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 3, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n",
      "    1 x 1 + 62 x 2 + 84 x 3 + 44 x 0 + 90 x 2\n",
      "    which is 557 (sum of all item values)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    which is less than your outside offer of 558. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n",
      "    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n",
      "\n",

The decision is in round 1, so there's no immediate discount applied. The focus is on maximizing immediate value.\\n\\n2) **Assessing the Current Offer:**\\n   - I'm currently offered: [2, 2, 1, 0, 1]\\n   - Evaluating my total value if I accept it:\\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \\u00d7 59 = 118\\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \\u00d7 52 = 104\\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \\u00d7 82 = 82\\n     - 0 unit of item 4 = 0 \\u00d7 60 = 0\\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \\u00d7 9 = 9\\n   - Total value of the current offer = 118 + 104 + 82 + 0 + 9 = 313\\n\\n   Since 313 is far less than my outside offer of 969, accepting the current offer would not be advantageous.\\n\\n3) **Deciding on Action:**\\n   - Accepting the current offer is not a good choice because its value (313) is much less than my outside offer (969).\\n   - Walking away is an option only if no better counteroffer can be made.\\n   - I need to construct a counteroffer where my total value is closer to or exceeds my outside offer value. For this, I need to keep more high-value items.\\n\\n**Counteroffer Calculation:**\\nTo maximize my value:\\n- If I keep 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5, my value would be calculated as follows:\\n  - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \\u00d7 59 = 295\\n  - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \\u00d7 52 = 208\\n  - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \\u00d7 82 = 328\\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \\u00d7 60 = 60\\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \\u00d7 9 = 27\\n- Total value = 295 + 208 + 328 + 60 + 27 = 918\\n\\n918 is still slightly below 969, but it's much better than the current offer. Further refinement is needed. \\n\\n**Offering a Relaxed Counteroffer:**\\n- I propose giving Player 1: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5, retaining most high-value items, to get closer to my outside offer value.\\n  - This means I keep [5, 4, 4, 2, 2], giving me:\\n    - 5 \\u00d7 59 + 4 \\u00d7 52 + 4 \\u00d7 82 + 2 \\u00d7 60 + 2 \\u00d7 9 = 295 + 208 + 328 + 120 + 18 = 969\\n\\n969 matches my outside offer exactly, perfectly optimizing my position.\\n\\nTherefore, I make the following counteroffer:\\n   \\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\",\n",

      "    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n",
      "    These mistakes are:\n",
      "    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n",
      "    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n",

      "    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n",
      "\n",
      "    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n",
      "    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n",

      "    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n",
      "    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n",
      "    These mistakes are:\n",
      "    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n",

      "    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n",
      "\n",
      "    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n",
      "    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 6, 3, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n",

Let's consider keeping maximum high-value items to achieve this goal:\\n\\n   Let's propose to keep [3, 5, 3, 3, 3], giving Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 1, 2]:\\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 x 35 = 105\\n   - 5 units of item 2 = 5 x 31 = 155\\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 x 73 = 219\\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 x 60 = 180\\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 3 x 21 = 63\\n   - Total value = 105 + 155 + 219 + 180 + 63 = 722\\n\\nRealizing the combined total is close but insufficient per the outside offer suggests a need for iteration. Let's narrow retention to optimize:\\n\\nPropose keeping [3, 5, 3, 4, 1], giving Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 0, 4]:\\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 x 35 = 105\\n   - 5 units of item 2 = 5 x 31 = 155\\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 x 73 = 219\\n   - 4 units of item 4 = 4 x 60 = 240\\n   - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 x 21 = 21\\n   - Total value = 105 + 155 + 219 + 240 + 21 = 740\\n\\nProposing this setup approximates fulfillment to my outside standard, and gambling marginally for gain strategywise:\\n\\nThe decision on these grounds:\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 4]}\",\n",

      "       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n",

      "    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n",
      "    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n",
      "    These mistakes are:\n",
      "    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n",
      "    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n",
      "    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n",
      "    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n",
      "    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n",
      "\n",
      "    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n",
      "    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 2, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n",
      "    20 x 0 + 84 x 4 + 70 x 2 + 61 x 3 + 32 x 3\n",
      "    which is 755 (sum of all item values) \n",
      "    \n",
      "    which is less than your outside offer of 756. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n",
      "    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n",

      "       - What are the values of the items involved?\n",
      "       - What is the total pool of items?\n",
      "       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n",

      "    2) Assess the value of offers:\n",
      "       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n",

      "       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n",
      "\n",
      "    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n",
      "       - Should I accept the current offer?\n",
      "       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n",
      "       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n",

      "    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n",
      "    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n",
      "    These mistakes are:\n",
      "    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n",
      "    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n",
      "    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n",
      "    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n",
      "    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n",
      "\n",
      "    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n",
      "    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n",
      "    77 x 0 + 3 x 0 + 37 x 1 + 56 x 0 + 7 x 7\n",
      "    which is 86 (sum of all item values) \n",
      "    \n",
      "    which is less than your outside offer of 87. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n",
      "    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n",

The current offer is significantly below my outside offer.\\n\\n3) Decision:\\n   - The current offer is much less than my outside offer, so accepting it would be a mistake.\\n   - Walking away would guarantee me a value of 799.\\n   - Proposing a counteroffer: I should aim to construct a counteroffer that gives me a value equal to or greater than 799 to be considered reasonable.\\n   - Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep more of the higher valued items to me:\\n     - Keep 0 of item 1\\n     - Keep 1 of item 2\\n     - Keep 2 of item 3\\n     - Keep 4 of item 4\\n     - Keep 4 of item 5\\n     - Compute total value:\\n       - 0 \\u00d7 22 + 1 \\u00d7 50 + 2 \\u00d7 55 + 4 \\u00d7 88 + 4 \\u00d7 44\\n       - = 0 + 50 + 110 + 352 + 176 = 688 which is less than my outside offer.\\n\\nLet's construct a more advantageous offer:\\n   If I keep:\\n     - 0 of item 1\\n     - 1 of item 2\\n     - 3 of item 3\\n     - 4 of item 4\\n     - 3 of item 5\\n   - Compute total value:\\n     - 0 \\u00d7 22 + 1 \\u00d7 50 + 3 \\u00d7 55 + 4 \\u00d7 88 + 3 \\u00d7 44\\n     - = 0 + 50 + 165 + 352 + 132 = 699 which is still less than my outside offer.\\n\\nI need to iterate and find an offer that meets or exceeds my outside offer:\\nLet's try to maximize my current offer value without changing my previous offers for consistency with negotiation expectations.  \\n\\nPropose:\\n  If I keep:\\n     - 4 of item 1\\n     - 1 of item 2\\n     - 1 of item 3\\n     - 5 of item 4\\n     - 2 of item 5\\n  - Compute total value:\\n     - = 4 \\u00d7 22 + 1 \\u00d7 50 + 1 \\u00d7 55 + 5 \\u00d7 88 + 2 \\u00d7 44\\n     - = 88 + 50 + 55 + 440 + 88 = 721 which is still less than my outside offer.\\n\\nUpon further calculations I realize most ways I computed are still below my outside offer, taking into account the diminishing return from round-to-round and the difficulty of negotiating better outcomes would lead me to WALK. \\n\\nTherefore, instead of iterating further on counteroffer, I choose to walk: \\n\\n\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"WALK\\\"}\",\n",

      "       - What are the values of the items involved?\n",
      "       - What is the total pool of items?\n",
      "       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n",

      "    2) Assess the value of offers:\n",
      "       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n",

      "       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n",

      "    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n",
      "       - Should I accept the current offer?\n",

      "       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n",

      "    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n",
      "    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n",
      "    These mistakes are:\n",
      "    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n",
      "    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n",
      "    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n",
      "    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n",
      "    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n",
      "\n",
      "    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n",
      "    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n",
      "    16 x 0 + 68 x 2 + 92 x 1 + 37 x 3 + 15 x 1\n",
      "    which is 354 (sum of all item values)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    which is less than your outside offer of 355. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n",
      "    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n",

      "    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n",

Let's try another allocation:\\n\\n   Counteroffer:\\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \\u00d7 84 = 252\\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \\u00d7 59 = 118\\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \\u00d7 71 = 142\\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \\u00d7 9 = 0\\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \\u00d7 14 = 0\\n     - Total = 252 + 118 + 142 = 512\\n\\n   Multiplying by the round 2 discount of 0.9:\\n   - Discounted Total = 512 \\u00d7 0.9 = 460.8\\n\\n   Since 460.8 is less than 597, let\\u2019s shift so it gets above 597 before the discount:\\n   Try shifting item 1, prefer keeping more and giving away less but maximizing:\\n\\n   Counteroffer: [1 unit of item 1 = 1 \\u00d7 84 = 84], [1 unit of item 2 = 1 \\u00d7 59 = 59], [1 unit of item 3 = 1 \\u00d7 71 = 71], [4 units of item 4 = 4 \\u00d7 9 = 36], [1 unit of item 5 = 1 \\u00d7 14 = 14]\\n   Player 1 keeps:\\n   - 4 units of item 1 = 336\\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 118\\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 142\\n   - 0 units of item 4 = 0\\n   - 0 units of item 5 = 0\\n   - Total = 336 + 118 + 142 = 596\\n\\n   This arrangement respects the maximized approach but acknowledges the inability to move beyond 597.

Accepting it would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\\n   - Walking away at this early stage is not advantageous since making counteroffers could improve the outcome.\\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value while still being potentially acceptable to Player 1.\\n\\nI will now propose a counteroffer, ensuring I don't fall below my outside offer value of 569.\\n\\n- If I propose giving Player 1 the following: [1, 1, 0, 2, 2], I will keep [3, 2, 2, 1, 0].\\n  - Total value to me = (3 \\u00d7 57) + (2 \\u00d7 42) + (2 \\u00d7 94) + (1 \\u00d7 15) + (0 \\u00d7 45)\\n  - Total value = 171 + 84 + 188 + 15 + 0 = 458\\n\\nThis proposal results in a value that is less than my outside offer of 569. I need to make it more favorable:\\n\\n- New counteroffer: [0, 0, 1, 3, 2], I will keep [4, 3, 1, 0, 0].\\n  - Total value to me = (4 \\u00d7 57) + (3 \\u00d7 42) + (1 \\u00d7 94) + (0 \\u00d7 15) + (0 \\u00d7 45)\\n  - Total value = 228 + 126 + 94 + 0 + 0 = 448\\n\\nStill significantly low. Propose another:\\n\\n- New counteroffer: [0, 1, 0, 3, 2], I will keep [4, 2, 2, 0, 0].\\n  - Total value to me = (4 \\u00d7 57) + (2 \\u00d7 42) + (2 \\u00d7 94) + (0 \\u00d7 15) + (0 \\u00d7 45)\\n  - Total value = 228 + 84 + 188 + 0 + 0 = 500\\n\\nThis offer still doesn't reach my outside offer. Attempting to adjust one more time:\\n\\n- Reasonable counteroffer: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2], keeping [4, 3, 1, 2, 0].\\n  - Total value to me = (4 \\u00d7 57) + (3 \\u00d7 42) + (1 \\u00d7 94) + (2 \\u00d7 15) + (0 \\u00d7 45)\\n  - Total value = 228 + 126 + 94 + 30 + 0 = 478\\n\\nThis attempt failed to surpass the outside offer. Final adjustment to ensure a better outcome:\\n\\n- Final attempt counteroffer: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1], keeping [4, 2, 1, 3, 1].\\n  - Total value to me = (4 \\u00d7 57) + (2 \\u00d7 42) + (1 \\u00d7 94) + (3 \\u00d7 15) + (1 \\u00d7 45)\\n  - Total value = 228 + 84 + 94 + 45 + 45 = 496\\n\\nI will walk away, as it consistently fails to reach or exceed my outside offer. \\n\\nGiven the failure to derive a better offer value, my decision is:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"WALK\\\"}\\n```\",\n",
