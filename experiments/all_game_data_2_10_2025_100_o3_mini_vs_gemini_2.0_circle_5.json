Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 252. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 252. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 951 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 0 + 90 x 2 + 70 x 0 + 27 x 1 + 43 x 1\n    which is 250 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 252. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1107. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 936 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 3, 4, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 6 + 53 x 3 + 98 x 4 + 79 x 3 + 39 x 1\n    which is 1085 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1107. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 483\n*   **Values of the items involved:** Item 1: 62, Item 2: 86, Item 3: 46, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 3\n*   **Total pool of items:** 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My value for this offer is:\n    0 * 62 + 0 * 86 + 0 * 46 + 0 * 4 + 1 * 3 = 3\n    This is much less than my outside offer of 483.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer (items offered to player 1) that leaves me with a value greater than 483. Since I have 6 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 3 of item 5, the total value is:\n    6 * 62 + 3 * 86 + 4 * 46 + 3 * 4 + 3 * 3 = 372 + 258 + 184 + 12 + 9 = 835\n\n    Let's consider offering Player 1 only items 4 and 5. Items 4 and 5 have low value for me.\n    If I offer [0, 0, 0, 3, 3], I keep all of items 1, 2, and 3. My value would be 6 * 62 + 3 * 86 + 4 * 46 = 372 + 258 + 184 = 814, which is greater than 483.\n\n    If I offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], I keep 5, 2, 3, 2, 2 respectively. My value would be:\n    5 * 62 + 2 * 86 + 3 * 46 + 2 * 4 + 2 * 3 = 310 + 172 + 138 + 8 + 6 = 634.\n\n    If I offer [2, 1, 2, 1, 1], I keep 4, 2, 2, 2, 2 respectively. My value would be:\n    4 * 62 + 2 * 86 + 2 * 46 + 2 * 4 + 2 * 3 = 248 + 172 + 92 + 8 + 6 = 526.\n\n    If I offer [3, 1, 2, 2, 2], I keep 3, 2, 2, 1, 1 respectively. My value would be:\n    3 * 62 + 2 * 86 + 2 * 46 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 3 = 186 + 172 + 92 + 4 + 3 = 457, which is less than 483.\n\n    So it seems that offering player 1 [2, 1, 2, 1, 1] is a pretty good offer for me.\n    \n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 3, which is much lower than my outside offer of 483.\n*   Walking away gives me a value of 483.\n*   I can propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 483.\n\nI will propose a counteroffer of [2, 1, 2, 1, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 584. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 573 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 4, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 2 + 29 x 0 + 97 x 4 + 24 x 2 + 32 x 4\n    which is 582 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 584. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 141\n*   My values for items: item 1: 33, item 2: 41, item 3: 91, item 4: 38, item 5: 33\n*   Total items: item 1: 3, item 2: 1, item 3: 4, item 4: 2, item 5: 4\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  This offer to me would result in a total value of 1 * 33 + 0 * 41 + 0 * 91 + 1 * 38 + 0 * 33 = 33 + 38 = 71.\n*   71 is less than my outside offer of 141. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to create a counteroffer that gives Player 1 some items while ensuring I receive a value greater than my outside offer.\n\nHere are a few options to consider:\n\n*   **Option 1:** Offer Player 1 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This would mean I keep 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 4 units of item 5. My value would be 3*33 + 1*41 + 3*91 + 2*38 + 4*33 = 99 + 41 + 273 + 76 + 132 = 621\n*   **Option 2:** Offer Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]. This means that I keep 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5. My value would be 2*33 + 1*41 + 3*91 + 2*38 + 3*33 = 66 + 41 + 273 + 76 + 99 = 555\n*   **Option 3:** Offer Player 1 [1, 0, 2, 1, 2]. This means I keep 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5. My value would be 2*33 + 1*41 + 2*91 + 1*38 + 2*33 = 66 + 41 + 182 + 38 + 66 = 393\n*   **Option 4:** Offer Player 1 [2, 1, 3, 2, 3]. This means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5. My value would be 1*33 + 0*41 + 1*91 + 0*38 + 1*33 = 33 + 91 + 33 = 157.\n*   **Option 5:** Offer Player 1 [2, 0, 3, 1, 3]. This means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5. My value would be 1*33 + 1*41 + 1*91 + 1*38 + 1*33 = 33 + 41 + 91 + 38 + 33 = 236.\n*   **Option 6:** Offer Player 1 [3, 1, 4, 2, 4]. This means I keep 0 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 0 unit of item 5. My value would be 0.\n\nSince it is round 1 and the discount is 0.9, a better counteroffer could be [2, 0, 3, 1, 3]. This gives me a value of 236.\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\nThe current offer is terrible. Walking away would give me 141.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 0 + 41 x 1 + 91 x 0 + 38 x 0 + 33 x 3\n    which is 140 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 141. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 3, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Analysis of the current situation:\n   - My outside offer is 637.\n   - My private values per unit are: item1 = 76, item2 = 99, item3 = 27, item4 = 69, item5 = 85.\n   - The total quantities available are: 5, 1, 3, 4, and 3 units for items 1\u20135 respectively (total \u201cpool\u201d of items).\n   - In round 1 there is no discount (gamma^(0) = 1), so getting a deal now means I obtain the full calculated value. Waiting adds a discount cost.\n   - Thus, any accepted offer must guarantee me a value above 637 and, ideally, be attractive enough for Player 2 so that they do not simply take their outside option.\n\n2. Assessing potential offers:\n   - Because I want to guarantee that if the offer is accepted I get more than my fallback (637), I calculate the \u201ckept value\u201d by summing over items: (quantity kept) \u00d7 (my value per unit).\n   - For example, if I were to offer almost nothing, such as [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] (giving away a single unit of item3, my lowest\u2013value item) then I\u2019d keep nearly the entire pool and receive a very high value (over 1000), but then Player 2 might find the offer too stingy on items and prefer to walk away.\n   - A balanced initial offer would aim to \u201cshare\u201d enough so Player 2 believes they are getting a fair deal relative to their unknown outside offer, while still leaving me with a high total (well above 637). \n   - In designing a candidate offer, I considered the importance of each item. For instance, item2 is very valuable to me (99 per unit) and is unique (only 1 available), so I prefer keeping it. In contrast, item3 is worth only 27 per unit to me, so I can afford to concede more of it.\n   - An offer such as [2, 0, 3, 1, 1] gives:\n       \u2022 For item1: Offering 2 out of 5 units (I keep 3) which nets me 3 \u00d7 76 = 228.\n       \u2022 For item2: Offering 0 (keeping the single unit) yields 99.\n       \u2022 For item3: Offering all 3 units, since it is low in my value, yields 0 from this item.\n       \u2022 For item4: Offering 1 out of 4 units (keeping 3) yields 3 \u00d7 69 = 207.\n       \u2022 For item5: Offering 1 out of 3 units (keeping 2) yields 2 \u00d7 85 = 170.\n       \u2022 Total kept value = 228 + 99 + 0 + 207 + 170 = 704, which is safely above my outside offer.\n   - Simultaneously, Player 2 receives 2+0+3+1+1 = 7 units (their \u201cbundle\u201d), which, assuming their private values average roughly 51 per unit (typical for a uniform draw from 1 to 101), would be in a range (roughly 350 or higher) that might compete favorably with their unknown fallback.\n   - This offer avoids the common pitfalls (don\u2019t give away nothing; don\u2019t propose a division where my kept value is below 637; and avoid making a worse offer than a previous one) and sets a reasonable starting point in round 1.\n\n3. Decision:\n   - My kept value of 704 (far above 637) maximizes my outcome while leaving a nonzero, though lean, share for Player 2.\n   - This is a cautious yet assertive offer that errs on the side of keeping most of the high\u2013value items while offering enough concession on lower\u2013value items.\n   - Therefore, my chosen action is to propose the offer [2, 0, 3, 1, 1].\n\nThus, I take the action as shown in the JSON above.",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 318. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 927 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 0 + 48 x 1 + 98 x 2 + 20 x 0 + 72 x 1\n    which is 316 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 318. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 201. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 867 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 0 + 75 x 0 + 56 x 1 + 51 x 1 + 31 x 3\n    which is 200 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 201. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means waiting for a future round reduces the value of any deal by a factor of 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I receive [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This means Player 1 gets [3, 3, 3, 4, 2].\n   - My value for the current offer: (0 * 35) + (0 * 27) + (0 * 13) + (1 * 6) + (1 * 41) = 47\n   - Comparison to outside offer: 47 < 90. Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\nNow, let's consider a potential counteroffer. I want to aim for a value greater than 90. Let's try keeping 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 5 and 2 units of item 3 and 3 units of item 4. The rest goes to the other player:\n   - I keep [2, 2, 2, 3, 2]. I offer [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n   - My value: (2 * 35) + (2 * 27) + (2 * 13) + (3 * 6) + (2 * 41) = 70 + 54 + 26 + 18 + 82 = 250. This is a significantly better value than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider keeping 1 unit of items 1, 2, 3 and 2 units of items 4 and 5.\n   - I keep [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]. I offer [2, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n   - My value: (1 * 35) + (1 * 27) + (1 * 13) + (2 * 6) + (2 * 41) = 35 + 27 + 13 + 12 + 82 = 169. This is a better value than my outside offer.\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept it.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 5, 7, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 2 + 45 x 4 + 86 x 5 + 46 x 7 + 19 x 5\n    which is 1071 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1072. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 1413.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 36, item 2 = 81, item 3 = 88, item 4 = 63, item 5 = 55.\n*   The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. Since it's round 1, the discount factor doesn't yet influence our immediate decision, but it will in future rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer and potential counteroffers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 0, 2]. This means I would receive 1 unit of item 1 and 2 units of item 5. The values are:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 36 = 36\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 55 = 110\n    *   Total value of current offer: 36 + 110 = 146\n    *   This is much less than my outside offer value of 1413.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to ensure that any counteroffer I make results in a value greater than my outside offer. The total value of all items is 2*36 + 4*81 + 5*88 + 9*63 + 6*55 = 72 + 324 + 440 + 567 + 330 = 1733. Let's explore a few scenarios to get a feel for the numbers.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: I offer Player 1 nothing.** I keep everything. My value is 1733. This is obviously better than my outside offer.\n    *   **Scenario 2: I offer Player 1 half of everything.** I'm keeping half of everything. My value is 1733 / 2 = 866.5. This is worse than my outside offer.\n    *   **Scenario 3: Keeping the minimum possible to exceed the outside offer:** Now this is a bit more challenging. We want to give as little as possible to Player 1, but something non-zero. I'm going to make an offer where I keep most of the items and give a bit away. For example, giving Player 1 [1, 2, 2, 4, 3] gives them some of each item, and may be close to their outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of [1, 0, 0, 0, 2] is worth only 146 to me, which is far less than my outside offer of 1413. Therefore, I should not accept it.\n\nI need to make a counteroffer that secures me a value greater than 1413. I will propose giving Player 1 [1, 2, 2, 4, 3] (one of item 1, two of item 2, two of item 3, four of item 4, and three of item 5). This leaves me with 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. Let's calculate the value of this:\n1 * 36 + 2 * 81 + 3 * 88 + 5 * 63 + 3 * 55 = 36 + 162 + 264 + 315 + 165 = 942. This is lower than the outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 2, 0], meaning they get two units of item 4.\nMy remaining items would be 2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 7 of item 4, and 6 of item 5.\nThe value is 2*36 + 4*81 + 5*88 + 7*63 + 6*55 = 72 + 324 + 440 + 441 + 330 = 1607. This is greater than the outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], meaning they get one unit of item 4.\nMy remaining items would be 2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 8 of item 4, and 6 of item 5.\nThe value is 2*36 + 4*81 + 5*88 + 8*63 + 6*55 = 72 + 324 + 440 + 504 + 330 = 1670. This is greater than the outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nMy value would be 1733, which is above the outside offer. However, offering nothing is a possible mistake.\n\nTo avoid mistake 3 (offering nothing), I'll offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1413. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 969 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 9, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 0 + 81 x 2 + 88 x 4 + 63 x 9 + 55 x 6\n    which is 1411 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1413. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1413.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 36, item 2 = 81, item 3 = 88, item 4 = 63, item 5 = 55.\n   - The total pool of items is: 2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 9 of item 4, 6 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its actual value, and an offer in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n   - Value of accepting current offer: 0 * 36 + 0 * 81 + 0 * 88 + 1 * 63 + 0 * 55 = 63.\n   - Discounted value of current offer: 63 * 0.9 = 56.7. This is much less than my outside offer of 1413.\n\n   Now, let's consider a potential counteroffer. My current holdings are: 2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 8 of item 4, 6 of item 5. Total value if I keep everything:\n    2 * 36 + 4 * 81 + 5 * 88 + 8 * 63 + 6 * 55 = 72 + 324 + 440 + 504 + 330 = 1670\n\n   I want to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 1413.\n\n   I'll examine the previous offers.\n   - In round 1, player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n   - In round 1, I offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n   - In round 2, player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n   The negotiations seem to be focusing on item 4, of which there are 9 units. Let's explore offering only item 4 to player 1. Suppose I offer 4 units of item 4. Then, the total value of my holdings will be:\n   2 * 36 + 4 * 81 + 5 * 88 + 5 * 63 + 6 * 55 = 72 + 324 + 440 + 315 + 330 = 1481\n   This is better than 1413. So, I can propose to give away 4 units of item 4.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is worth 56.7, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 1413. Therefore, I should not accept.\n   - Walking away gives me 1413.\n   - Counteroffering is my best option. I will propose to give Player 1 4 units of item 4, so my counteroffer is [0, 0, 0, 4, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 6, 3, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 2 + 18 x 6 + 91 x 3 + 69 x 3 + 44 x 3\n    which is 864 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 865. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

I can start by trying to keep as much of the valuable items as possible (items 1 and 3) and giving away more of the less valuable items (items 2 and 5).\n\n   Let's try keeping [4, 4, 4, 3, 2] (giving [0, 2, 0, 0, 3] to Player 1):\n      - Value of item 1: 4 * 72 = 288\n      - Value of item 2: 4 * 18 = 72\n      - Value of item 3: 4 * 91 = 364\n      - Value of item 4: 3 * 69 = 207\n      - Value of item 5: 2 * 44 = 88\n      - Total value: 288 + 72 + 364 + 207 + 88 = 1019\n      - This is better than my outside offer.\n\n   Let's try keeping [3, 5, 3, 2, 4] (giving [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1):\n      - Value of item 1: 3 * 72 = 216\n      - Value of item 2: 5 * 18 = 90\n      - Value of item 3: 3 * 91 = 273\n      - Value of item 4: 2 * 69 = 138\n      - Value of item 5: 4 * 44 = 176\n      - Total value: 216 + 90 + 273 + 138 + 176 = 893\n      - This is also better than my outside offer\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is not acceptable.\n   - I have found some counteroffers that are better than my outside offer.

This means I'm giving the rest to Player 1.\n    * This means I'm offering Player 1 [1, 6, 1, 1, 5]\n    * What I keep is (3 * 72) + (0 * 18) + (3 * 91) + (2 * 69) + (0 * 44) = 216 + 0 + 273 + 138 + 0 = 627\n    * This is way below my outside offer.\n    * Let's propose to keep 3 units of item 1, all units of item 3, all units of item 4.\n    * That is I am keeping [3, 0, 4, 3, 0] of items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively.\n    * This means I'm offering Player 1 [1, 6, 0, 0, 5]\n    * The value of what I keep is (3 * 72) + (0 * 18) + (4 * 91) + (3 * 69) + (0 * 44) = 216 + 0 + 364 + 207 + 0 = 787. This is below my outside offer.\n    * Let me propose to keep 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and all units of item 5.\n    * That is I am keeping [4, 0, 2, 2, 5] of items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively.\n    * This means I'm offering Player 1 [0, 6, 2, 1, 0]\n    * The value of what I keep is (4 * 72) + (0 * 18) + (2 * 91) + (2 * 69) + (5 * 44) = 288 + 0 + 182 + 138 + 220 = 828. This is below my outside offer.\n    * Let me propose to keep 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and all units of item 5.\n    * That is I am keeping [4, 0, 3, 2, 5] of items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively.\n    * This means I'm offering Player 1 [0, 6, 1, 1, 0]\n    * The value of what I keep is (4 * 72) + (0 * 18) + (3 * 91) + (2 * 69) + (5 * 44) = 288 + 0 + 273 + 138 + 220 = 919. This is above my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. I should make a counteroffer. I will offer Player 1 [0, 6, 1, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 6, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 576. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 576. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 663 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 3, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 0 + 47 x 6 + 64 x 3 + 49 x 2 + 3 x 1\n    which is 575 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 576. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

In any division our own \u201cshare\u201d is computed by subtracting from the total items the numbers we offer to Player 2. For example, if we give opponent n_i units for item i, our allocation is (total_i \u2013 n_i).\n4. We want to propose an offer that gives us high value (well above 350) while giving Player 2 at least some items to make the offer seem acceptable and avoid the appearance of an inequitably greedy deal.\n5. One candidate proposal is to offer Player 2:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 3 units\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2 units\n\u2003Then our allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units \u2192 2\u00d737 = 74\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 7 \u2013 3 = 4 units \u2192 4\u00d785 = 340\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 2 \u2013 1 = 1 unit \u2192 1\u00d731 = 31\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 2 \u2013 1 = 1 unit \u2192 1\u00d723 = 23\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 4 \u2013 2 = 2 units \u2192 2\u00d746 = 92\n\u2003Total value = 74 + 340 + 31 + 23 + 92 = 560, which is comfortably above our fallback value.\n6. This offer avoids the five mistakes: it gives us a total above the outside offer, it does not offer all or none, and it keeps a consistent improvement relative to our fallback.\n7.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 455. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1200 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 455.\n*   **Item Values:** My values for items 1-5 are 81, 95, 97, 73, and 54, respectively.\n*   **Total Item Pool:** There are 3 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to both players.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 3, 1, 1, 2]. This means I receive 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n*   **Value of Current Offer:**\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 81 = 81\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 95 = 285\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 97 = 97\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 73 = 73\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 54 = 108\n    *   Total value: 81 + 285 + 97 + 73 + 108 = 644\n\n3) **Compare the current offer to my outside offer:**\n\n*   The value of the current offer (644) is greater than my outside offer (455).\n\n4) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\n*   Since the current offer is already better than my outside offer, I should only consider counteroffers that would give me an even higher value.\n*   However, it's Round 1, and I could potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n*   Let's consider what would happen if I kept all the items. My total value is 3 * 81 + 7 * 95 + 2 * 97 + 2 * 73 + 4 * 54 = 243 + 665 + 194 + 146 + 216 = 1464.\n*   If I make a counteroffer I want to make sure that what I end up with is more than my outside offer of 455.\n\n5) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer gives me a value of 644 which is greater than my outside offer of 455, it's not Mistake 4. However, as it's only round 1, there is a possibility of getting a better offer by making a counteroffer.\n\nLet's think about a possible counteroffer. To avoid Mistake 3, let's not offer all or no items to the opponent. A potential counteroffer is to offer Player 1 [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], meaning I keep all of item 1, 3 of item 2, all of items 3, 4, and 5. This gives me a value of: 3*81 + 3*95 + 2*97 + 2*73 + 4*54 = 243 + 285 + 194 + 146 + 216 = 1084.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 455\n*   My values per item: item 1: 81, item 2: 95, item 3: 97, item 4: 73, item 5: 54\n*   Total items: item 1: 3, item 2: 7, item 3: 2, item 4: 2, item 5: 4\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value to me. An offer accepted in round 3 will be worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 3, 1, 2, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 81 = 81\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 95 = 285\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 97 = 97\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 73 = 146\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 54 = 54\n    *   Total value of current offer: 81 + 285 + 97 + 146 + 54 = 663\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 663 * 0.9 = 596.7\n\n*   **Previous offer:** Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 1, 2] in the first round. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 81 = 81\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 95 = 285\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 97 = 97\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 73 = 73\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 54 = 108\n    *   Total value of previous offer: 81 + 285 + 97 + 73 + 108 = 644\n    *   Discounted value of the first offer in round 2: 644*0.9 = 579.6\n\n*   **My previous offer:** Player 2 offered [0, 4, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1. Thus, I got:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 81 = 243\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 95 = 285\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 97 = 194\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 73 = 146\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 54 = 216\n    *   Total value of my previous offer: 243 + 285 + 194 + 146 + 216 = 1084\n    *   Discounted value of my previous offer: 1084 * 0.9 = 975.6\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer, with a discounted value of 596.7, is significantly better than my outside offer of 455.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's explore a few counteroffer options, keeping in mind I want to maximize my value while making the offer attractive to Player 1.\n    *   Keeping [2, 4, 1, 1, 2] gives to Player 1 [1, 3, 1, 1, 2], like in round 1. We know this gives me 644, or 579.6 discounted\n    *   Keeping [2, 5, 2, 2, 4] gives to Player 1 [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]. The value for me is 2*81 + 5*95 + 2*97 + 2*73 + 4*54 = 162+475+194+146+216 = 1193 or 1073.7 discounted.\n    *   Keeping [3, 6, 2, 2, 4] gives to Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. The value for me is 3*81 + 6*95 + 2*97 + 2*73 + 4*54 = 243+570+194+146+216 = 1369 or 1232.1 discounted.\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a discounted value of 596.7, which is better than my outside option of 455. I could accept the current offer, or make a counteroffer, but if I can not agree to anything in the end, it will be round 3.\n\nGiven that the current offer is already quite good, and there's a risk that Player 1 might walk away if I make a counteroffer, and since it is round 2, let's make a counteroffer.\nMy counteroffer will be to keep: [2, 5, 2, 2, 4], thus offering to Player 1: [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]. This gives me a discounted value of 1073.7.\nI'm aiming for a larger share of the items while ensuring the offer remains appealing to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 350. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 666 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1167. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1026 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 8, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 2 + 66 x 2 + 74 x 8 + 97 x 2 + 38 x 3\n    which is 1166 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1167. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 1335\n*   My values for items: item 1 = 40, item 2 = 79, item 3 = 72, item 4 = 5, item 5 = 7\n*   Total items: item 1 = 9, item 2 = 5, item 3 = 8, item 4 = 3, item 5 = 4\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This means I receive 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, and 1 unit of item 3.\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 40) + (1 * 79) + (1 * 72) + (0 * 5) + (0 * 7) = 40 + 79 + 72 = 191\n    *   Since 191 is significantly less than my outside offer of 1335, I should not accept this offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1335. I also want to leave enough value for Player 1 to accept. Let's try to keep a large portion of the items. Let's start with the counteroffer where I give away [1, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n    * This means I keep [8, 5, 7, 3, 4]\n    * My value from that: (8 * 40) + (5 * 79) + (7 * 72) + (3 * 5) + (4 * 7) = 320 + 395 + 504 + 15 + 28 = 1262\n    * This is less than my outside offer, so this counteroffer is not good.\n\n* Let's try an offer to Player 1 of [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]. Then I keep [7, 4, 6, 2, 3]\n    * My value would be: (7 * 40) + (4 * 79) + (6 * 72) + (2 * 5) + (3 * 7) = 280 + 316 + 432 + 10 + 21 = 1059. That is still too low.\n\n* Let's try an offer to Player 1 of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This is the same as keeping everything.\n    *My value would be: (9 * 40) + (5 * 79) + (8 * 72) + (3 * 5) + (4 * 7) = 360 + 395 + 576 + 15 + 28 = 1374. \n\nSince 1374 > 1335, I need to make an offer less favorable to myself, but still better than my outside offer. Let's offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n* My value then would be: (8 * 40) + (4 * 79) + (7 * 72) + (2 * 5) + (3 * 7) = 320 + 316 + 504 + 10 + 21 = 1171.

So Player 1 gets [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n* I get to keep: [7, 5, 8, 3, 4]\n* My value then would be: (7 * 40) + (5 * 79) + (8 * 72) + (3 * 5) + (4 * 7) = 280 + 395 + 576 + 15 + 28 = 1294. This is still too low.\n\nLet's offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n* I get to keep [9, 5, 7, 3, 4]\n* My value then would be: (9 * 40) + (5 * 79) + (7 * 72) + (3 * 5) + (4 * 7) = 360 + 395 + 504 + 15 + 28 = 1302. Still too low!\n\nLet's offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n*I get to keep [9, 4, 8, 3, 4]\n*My value: (9 * 40) + (4 * 79) + (8 * 72) + (3 * 5) + (4 * 7) = 360 + 316 + 576 + 15 + 28 = 1295.\n\nIf I want an offer that is better than 1335, and I start at 1374, I need to give the other player at least 40 worth of value.\nSo, I offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] This will mean I keep [8, 5, 8, 3, 4]\n* Value = (8 * 40) + (5 * 79) + (8 * 72) + (3 * 5) + (4 * 7) = 320 + 395 + 576 + 15 + 28 = 1334.\n\nSo I should offer more than that. Let me offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. \nMy value = (9 * 40) + (4 * 79) + (8 * 72) + (3 * 5) + (4 * 7) = 360 + 316 + 576 + 15 + 28 = 1295\nLet me offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0].\nMy value = (9 * 40) + (5 * 79) + (7 * 72) + (3 * 5) + (4 * 7) = 360 + 395 + 504 + 15 + 28 = 1302\n\nLet's offer [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nMy value = (7 * 40) + (5 * 79) + (8 * 72) + (3 * 5) + (4 * 7) = 280 + 395 + 576 + 15 + 28 = 1294.\nLet's offer [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nMy value = (9 * 40) + (3 * 79) + (8 * 72) + (3 * 5) + (4 * 7) = 360 + 237 + 576 + 15 + 28 = 1216.\n\nThe original offer of [1, 1, 1, 0, 0] gave me a value of 191. Player 1 seems to value item 1 the least of those items, so I think giving them more of that might work.\nLet's offer Player 1: [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My value then is: (6 * 40) + (5 * 79) + (8 * 72) + (3 * 5) + (4 * 7) = 240 + 395 + 576 + 15 + 28 = 1254.\n\nThe best I have is to offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means I keep everything, and I value it at 1374.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1335. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1335. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 609 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [8, 5, 8, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 8 + 79 x 5 + 72 x 8 + 5 x 3 + 7 x 4\n    which is 1334 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1335. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 1335\n*   Item values: Item 1 = 40, Item 2 = 79, Item 3 = 72, Item 4 = 5, Item 5 = 7\n*   Total items: Item 1 = 9, Item 2 = 5, Item 3 = 8, Item 4 = 3, Item 5 = 4\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value to me. An offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: 0 * 40 + 0 * 79 + 0 * 72 + 0 * 5 + 1 * 7 = 7\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 7 * 0.9 = 6.3\n    *   This is significantly lower than my outside offer of 1335.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would keep and offer the rest to Player 1. My goal is to get a discounted value that is greater than my outside offer. Let's consider a scenario where I keep all the items. The value would be:\n    *   9 * 40 + 5 * 79 + 8 * 72 + 3 * 5 + 4 * 7 = 360 + 395 + 576 + 15 + 28 = 1374\n    *   If I keep all items, my discounted value in the next round would be 1374 * 0.9 = 1236.6, which is still less than my outside offer of 1335.\n    *   Therefore, I should not expect to make a deal with player 1 in the later rounds.\n\n    Let's consider a potential counteroffer. In the previous round, Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. I offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Player 1 is now offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. Player 1 is likely valuing item 5 high. Let's try to make a deal where I get the items that I value high, and Player 1 gets items they value high. I value items 2 and 3 the highest. Let's try to keep all of item 2 and 3. I need to make sure that what I am giving Player 1 is worth more than my outside offer.\n    Let's keep [9, 5, 8, 3, 3]. This gives Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. My value is 9*40 + 5*79 + 8*72 + 3*5 + 3*7 = 360 + 395 + 576 + 15 + 21 = 1367. My discounted value for the next round is 1367*0.9 = 1230.3. This is much lower than my outside offer, so this will not work.\n\n    Let's consider another scenario where I give Player 1 only item 1, but I need to make sure my discounted value is better than my outside offer. Let's give Player 1 1 unit of item 1. Then I keep [8, 5, 8, 3, 4]. My value is 8*40 + 5*79 + 8*72 + 3*5 + 4*7 = 320 + 395 + 576 + 15 + 28 = 1334. Then the discounted value would be 1334 * 0.9 = 1200.6, which is lower than the outside offer.\n\n    It looks like I am better off walking away.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is much worse than my outside offer, and it seems difficult to reach a deal that would give me more than my outside offer, I will walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 599.\n   - My values for items 1-5 are 95, 54, 45, 70, and 29, respectively.\n   - The total pool of items is 6 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 8 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 5 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth 90% of the same offer in the current round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n   - The current offer is [0, 0, 8, 0, 5]. This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n   - If I accept this offer, I get:\n      - 0 * 95 + 0 * 54 + 8 * 45 + 0 * 70 + 5 * 29 = 0 + 0 + 360 + 0 + 145 = 505\n\n3) **Compare the current offer to my outside offer:**\n   - The current offer (505) is less than my outside offer (599).\n\n4) **Consider a potential counteroffer:**\nLet's try to create a counteroffer that's better than my outside offer. I need to keep items for myself such that the total value exceeds 599. Let's try keeping half of items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n   - I keep 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\n   - Value = 3 * 95 + 2 * 54 + 4 * 45 + 2 * 70 + 2 * 29 = 285 + 108 + 180 + 140 + 58 = 771\n   - I offer 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5 to Player 1.\n   - My counteroffer is [3, 2, 4, 3, 3].\n\n5) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer is worth 505, which is less than my outside offer of 599. Therefore, I should not accept.\n   - Proposing the counteroffer [3, 2, 4, 3, 3] results in me keeping items worth 771 to me.\n   - Walking away gives me 599.\n   - So, making the counteroffer is better than both accepting and walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 4, 3, 3]}\n```",

This means I keep:\n      - Item 1: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n      - Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n      - Item 3: 8 - 2 = 6 units\n      - Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n      - Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n      My value for this offer is: (5 * 95) + (3 * 54) + (6 * 45) + (3 * 70) + (2 * 29) = 475 + 162 + 270 + 210 + 58 = 1175\n      Since this is round 2, the discounted value of this offer is 1175 * 0.9^(2-1) = 1175 * 0.9 = 1057.5\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 1057.5 > 599.

Since this is round 2, there is one round left.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer.** I need to figure out an offer to give to Player 1.\n\n    I need to be mindful of the five mistakes. Let's analyze the previous offers:\n\n    - Round 1, Player 1 offered [0, 0, 8, 0, 5]. My value would have been:\n        (6 * 95) + (4 * 54) + (0 * 45) + (5 * 70) + (0 * 29) = 570 + 216 + 0 + 350 + 0 = 1136\n        Discounted value = 1136 * 0.9^0 = 1136\n\n    - Round 1, I offered [3, 2, 4, 3, 3]. That means I would have kept:\n        (3 * 95) + (2 * 54) + (4 * 45) + (2 * 70) + (2 * 29) = 285 + 108 + 180 + 140 + 58 = 771\n        Discounted value = 771 * 0.9^0 = 771.\n\n    - Round 2, Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]. Which I calculated above has a value to me of 1057.5\n\nLet me try to calculate a counteroffer. I will try to keep more of item 1 and 4 because my values for those items are high. Let's say I offer Player 1: [0, 1, 4, 1, 3]. This means I keep:\n    - Item 1: 6 - 0 = 6\n    - Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n    - Item 3: 8 - 4 = 4\n    - Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4\n    - Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2\nMy value would be: (6 * 95) + (3 * 54) + (4 * 45) + (4 * 70) + (2 * 29) = 570 + 162 + 180 + 280 + 58 = 1250.\nDiscounted value = 1250 * 0.9 = 1125. This is better than the current offer.\n\nLet me try another offer: Offer [0, 0, 3, 0, 2] to player 1. Keep [6, 4, 5, 5, 3].\nMy value is: (6 * 95) + (4 * 54) + (5 * 45) + (5 * 70) + (3 * 29) = 570 + 216 + 225 + 350 + 87 = 1448. Discounted = 1448 * 0.9 = 1303.2. This seems even better! But is it feasible?\n\nLet's try offering [2, 1, 4, 2, 3] to player 1. Keep [4, 3, 4, 3, 2].\nMy value is: (4 * 95) + (3 * 54) + (4 * 45) + (3 * 70) + (2 * 29) = 380 + 162 + 180 + 210 + 58 = 990. Discounted = 990 * 0.9 = 891. This is not so good.\n\nSo, offering [0, 0, 3, 0, 2] seems like the best counteroffer so far. It is better than accepting the current offer and better than my outside option.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 0, 2]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 5, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 0 + 55 x 1 + 44 x 5 + 72 x 5 + 44 x 5\n    which is 855 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 857. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 8, 0, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 4, 3, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 0 + 53 x 0 + 34 x 0 + 99 x 0 + 24 x 1\n    which is 24 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 45. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 45\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 65, Item 2: 53, Item 3: 34, Item 4: 99, Item 5: 24\n*   **Total items:** 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means waiting reduces the value by 10% per round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. My value is:\n    (1 * 65) + (2 * 53) + (0 * 34) + (1 * 99) + (2 * 24) = 65 + 106 + 0 + 99 + 48 = 318\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 318, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 45.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer (318) is significantly better than my outside offer (45), accepting it seems like a good option.  However, let's consider a counteroffer. It's round 1, so there's room to negotiate.\n\nLet's consider keeping all the valuable items. What would that look like? I have 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5.\n\n* Value of keeping all items: (4 * 65) + (4 * 53) + (0 * 34) + (2 * 99) + (6 * 24) = 260 + 212 + 0 + 198 + 144 = 814\nLet's construct a counteroffer where I get at least more than my outside option. So, i will propose that Player 1 get [2, 2, 0, 0, 3]. This leaves me with:\nItem 1: 2, Value: 2 * 65 = 130\nItem 2: 2, Value: 2 * 53 = 106\nItem 3: 0, Value: 0 * 34 = 0\nItem 4: 2, Value: 2 * 99 = 198\nItem 5: 3, Value: 3 * 24 = 72\n\nTotal Value: 130 + 106 + 0 + 198 + 72 = 506\n\nThis is greater than my outside option of 45 and greater than the value of the current offer on the table of 318, so lets make it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 0, 3]}\n```",

Your value would be:\n    94 x 4 + 26 x 5 + 46 x 3 + 7 x 1 + 46 x 1\n    which is 697 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 698. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 698.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 94, item 2 = 26, item 3 = 46, item 4 = 7, item 5 = 46.\n*   The total pool of items is: 7 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 1 of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now. This encourages reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 1 unit of item 1. The value to me is 1 * 94 = 94.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (94) is much less than my outside offer (698).\n\n3) **Consider potential counteroffers:**\n\nI need to calculate the value of potential counteroffers to ensure they exceed my outside offer. I will calculate the value of keeping certain amounts and offering the rest to Player 1. The total number of each item is: [7, 5, 6, 3, 1]\n\nIf I keep [7, 5, 6, 3, 1]: \nValue = (7 * 94) + (5 * 26) + (6 * 46) + (3 * 7) + (1 * 46) = 658 + 130 + 276 + 21 + 46 = 1131.\n\nI need to offer something to player 1 to reach an agreement, but I want to keep the total value I receive over 698.\n\nHere are a few sample counteroffers I could make:\n\n*   **Counteroffer 1:** Offer [2, 1, 1, 1, 0]. This means I keep [5, 4, 5, 2, 1].\nValue = (5 * 94) + (4 * 26) + (5 * 46) + (2 * 7) + (1 * 46) = 470 + 104 + 230 + 14 + 46 = 864\nThis is greater than my outside offer, so it is a possible counteroffer.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 2:** Offer [3, 2, 2, 1, 0]. This means I keep [4, 3, 4, 2, 1].\nValue = (4 * 94) + (3 * 26) + (4 * 46) + (2 * 7) + (1 * 46) = 376 + 78 + 184 + 14 + 46 = 698\nThis is equal to my outside offer, so it is a possible counteroffer, but not a very attractive one as it only meets my reservation utility and leaves no room for negotiation in future rounds.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 3:** Offer [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I keep [6, 5, 5, 3, 1].\nValue = (6 * 94) + (5 * 26) + (5 * 46) + (3 * 7) + (1 * 46) = 564 + 130 + 230 + 21 + 46 = 991.\nThis is a better counteroffer, keeping more value for myself while giving the other player enough to potentially agree.\n\nSince I'm in round 1, I should make a counteroffer. Counteroffer 1 and 3 are acceptable, with counteroffer 3 being more favorable to me. Counteroffer 2 would be a bad choice as there would be no gain to negotiating.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI will propose Counteroffer 3: [1, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 44. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 735 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 56 x 0 + 40 x 1 + 82 x 0 + 59 x 0\n    which is 40 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 44. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This incentivizes reaching a deal sooner rather than later, but only if the offer is close in value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [3, 0, 2, 0, 0]. This means I receive 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (3 * 94) + (0 * 79) + (2 * 44) + (0 * 55) + (0 * 7) = 282 + 0 + 88 + 0 + 0 = 370\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 370, which is LESS than my outside offer of 380.\n\n3) **Consider a potential counteroffer:**\nI want to end up with a total value greater than 380 after the discount factor. Since it is round 1 the discount factor is not in effect, so I want to end up with a total value greater than 380. The offer must also be valid given the number of items available.\n\nLet's start by determining how much of the items are still available.\nItem 1: 5 units total, Player 1 is offering me 3, so Player 1 keeps 2\nItem 2: 0 units total, Player 1 is offering me 0, so Player 1 keeps 0\nItem 3: 5 units total, Player 1 is offering me 2, so Player 1 keeps 3\nItem 4: 4 units total, Player 1 is offering me 0, so Player 1 keeps 4\nItem 5: 4 units total, Player 1 is offering me 0, so Player 1 keeps 4\n\nI will start by increasing my holding in item 1 to 4. So Player 1 receives 1. And keep the rest the same.\nCounteroffer: [1, 0, 3, 4, 4]\nMy holdings: [4, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nValue: (4 * 94) + (0 * 79) + (2 * 44) + (0 * 55) + (0 * 7) = 376 + 0 + 88 + 0 + 0 = 464\n\nLet's try offering the other player [1, 0, 3, 3, 4]\nMy holdings: [4, 0, 2, 1, 0]\nValue: (4 * 94) + (0 * 79) + (2 * 44) + (1 * 55) + (0 * 7) = 376 + 0 + 88 + 55 + 0 = 519\n\nLet's try offering the other player [0, 0, 3, 3, 4]\nMy holdings: [5, 0, 2, 1, 0]\nValue: (5 * 94) + (0 * 79) + (2 * 44) + (1 * 55) + (0 * 7) = 470 + 0 + 88 + 55 + 0 = 613\n\n4) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 40. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 846 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 0 + 75 x 0 + 19 x 2 + 81 x 0 + 100 x 0\n    which is 38 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 40. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 3, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 3, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "The current offer on the table is [0, 0, 3, 3, 4], which means that if I accept, I get exactly these amounts and Player 2 gets the remaining items. The total items available are:  \n\u2022 Item 1: 5 units  \n\u2022 Item 2: 0 units  \n\u2022 Item 3: 5 units  \n\u2022 Item 4: 4 units  \n\u2022 Item 5: 4 units  \n\nSince the offer defines what is given to me, I would obtain:  \n\u2022 Item 1: 0 units (0 \u00d7 7 = 0)  \n\u2022 Item 2: 0 units (0 \u00d7 75 = 0)  \n\u2022 Item 3: 3 units (3 \u00d7 19 = 57)  \n\u2022 Item 4: 3 units (3 \u00d7 81 = 243)  \n\u2022 Item 5: 4 units (4 \u00d7 100 = 400)  \n\nMy total raw value would be 57 + 243 + 400 = 700. However, because we are in round 2, the discount factor is gamma^(2-1) = 0.9, so the effective value is 700 \u00d7 0.9 = 630.\n\nMy outside offer guarantees me a value of 40, which is much less than 630. Since accepting avoids the risk of worsening our outcome (and because rejecting a deal that gives 630 in discounted value falls under the risk of making Mistake 5), the best decision is to ACCEPT the current offer rather than risk a counteroffer that might lead to an even more discounted outcome.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 345. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 660 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 5, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 0 + 9 x 3 + 34 x 5 + 49 x 1 + 98 x 1\n    which is 344 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 345. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 3, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 3, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 737.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 16, item 2 = 8, item 3 = 40, item 4 = 9, item 5 = 99.\n*   The total pool of items is: 6 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth 90% of the value of accepting it in the current round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [4, 3, 2, 0, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   4 units of item 1, value = 4 * 16 = 64\n    *   3 units of item 2, value = 3 * 8 = 24\n    *   2 units of item 3, value = 2 * 40 = 80\n    *   0 units of item 4, value = 0 * 9 = 0\n    *   1 units of item 5, value = 1 * 99 = 99\n    *   Total value = 64 + 24 + 80 + 0 + 99 = 267\n\n    *   Since 267 < 737 (my outside offer), accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I could offer Player 1 that would leave me with a value greater than my outside offer. It's round 1, so a good strategy might be to aim for close to a 50/50 split in value. I should start by thinking of potential allocations that yield greater than 737 for me. Let's start with giving the player back the exact offer they proposed: [4, 3, 2, 0, 1]. That would leave me with [2, 3, 5, 2, 2]. The value of that would be:\n    * 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 16 = 32\n    * 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 8 = 24\n    * 5 units of item 3 = 5 * 40 = 200\n    * 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 9 = 18\n    * 2 units of item 5 = 2 * 99 = 198\n    * Total value = 32 + 24 + 200 + 18 + 198 = 472\n\n    That is still far below 737. Let's try an extreme counteroffer where I give them much less [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. My value then would be:\n    * I have [5, 5, 6, 2, 3]\n    * Value is 5 * 16 + 5 * 8 + 6 * 40 + 2 * 9 + 3 * 99 = 80 + 40 + 240 + 18 + 297 = 675\nStill less than 737. Let's give back even less: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] This would leave me with:\n    * 6 * 16 + 6 * 8 + 7 * 40 + 2 * 9 + 3 * 99 = 96 + 48 + 280 + 18 + 297 = 739.\n\nI need to give away something. Item 1 is the least valuable to me. Let me give away one unit of item 1:\nCounteroffer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My value then is:\n    * 5 * 16 + 6 * 8 + 7 * 40 + 2 * 9 + 3 * 99 = 80 + 48 + 280 + 18 + 297 = 723\nThat is too little, less than my outside offer.\n\nItem 2 is the next least valuable. Let me give away only 1 unit of item 2.\nCounteroffer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. My value then is:\n    * 6 * 16 + 5 * 8 + 7 * 40 + 2 * 9 + 3 * 99 = 96 + 40 + 280 + 18 + 297 = 731\nAlso too low. Let me give away one unit of item 4.\nCounteroffer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. My value then is:\n    * 6 * 16 + 6 * 8 + 7 * 40 + 1 * 9 + 3 * 99 = 96 + 48 + 280 + 9 + 297 = 730\nStill too low. Let me give away one unit of item 3\nCounteroffer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. My value then is:\n    * 6 * 16 + 6 * 8 + 6 * 40 + 2 * 9 + 3 * 99 = 96 + 48 + 240 + 18 + 297 = 699\n\nOk. Let's give one of item 1 and item 2.\nCounteroffer [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. My value then is:\n    * 5 * 16 + 5 * 8 + 7 * 40 + 2 * 9 + 3 * 99 = 80 + 40 + 280 + 18 + 297 = 715\n\nLet's try giving away one of item 1 and item 4:\nCounteroffer [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]. My value then is:\n* 5 * 16 + 6 * 8 + 7 * 40 + 1 * 9 + 3 * 99 = 80 + 48 + 280 + 9 + 297 = 714\n\nLet's try giving away one of item 1 and item 5:\nCounteroffer [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]. My value then is:\n* 5 * 16 + 6 * 8 + 7 * 40 + 2 * 9 + 2 * 99 = 80 + 48 + 280 + 18 + 198 = 624\n\nOkay. I see that I'm losing value by giving away one item 1 and one item 2. I am also losing value by giving item 1 and item 4.\n\nLet's just try giving them 0 of items 1-4, and only item 5.\nCounteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n* 6 * 16 + 6 * 8 + 7 * 40 + 2 * 9 + 2 * 99 = 96 + 48 + 280 + 18 + 198 = 640\n\nHow about giving them only item 3?\nCounteroffer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n* 6 * 16 + 6 * 8 + 6 * 40 + 2 * 9 + 3 * 99 = 96 + 48 + 240 + 18 + 297 = 699\n\nLet's try giving away 1 unit each of item 1 and item 3.\nCounteroffer [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n* 5 * 16 + 6 * 8 + 6 * 40 + 2 * 9 + 3 * 99 = 80 + 48 + 240 + 18 + 297 = 683\n\nLet's try giving away 1 unit each of item 2 and item 3.\nCounteroffer [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n* 6 * 16 + 5 * 8 + 6 * 40 + 2 * 9 + 3 * 99 = 96 + 40 + 240 + 18 + 297 = 691\n\nLet's try giving away 1 unit each of item 1, 2, and 3.\nCounteroffer [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n* 5 * 16 + 5 * 8 + 6 * 40 + 2 * 9 + 3 * 99 = 80 + 40 + 240 + 18 + 297 = 675\n\nGiven my values, it seems difficult to reach a split that is substantially above my outside offer while giving Player 1 \"reasonable\" items. I'll make a somewhat greedy counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 401. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 690 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means I would receive:\n    *   4 units of item 1, valued at 4 * 16 = 64\n    *   3 units of item 2, valued at 3 * 8 = 24\n    *   2 units of item 3, valued at 2 * 40 = 80\n    *   0 units of item 4, valued at 0 * 9 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5, valued at 1 * 99 = 99\n    *   Total value = 64 + 24 + 80 + 0 + 99 = 267\n    *   Discounted value = 267 * (0.9^(2-1)) = 267 * 0.9 = 240.3\n\n*   Since 240.3 is less than my outside offer of 737, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few counteroffers to ensure we avoid mistakes.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** Keep [6, 6, 7, 2, 3] for myself and offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1.\n\n        *   My value: 6*16 + 6*8 + 7*40 + 2*9 + 3*99 = 96 + 48 + 280 + 18 + 297 = 739.\n        *   Discounted value: 739 * 0.9 = 665.1\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 2:** Keep [6, 5, 7, 2, 3] for myself and offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1.\n\n        *   My value: 6*16 + 5*8 + 7*40 + 2*9 + 3*99 = 96 + 40 + 280 + 18 + 297 = 731\n        *   Discounted value: 731 * 0.9 = 657.9\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 3:**  Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1 (keep everything).\n        * My Value = 739\n        * Discounted Value = 739 * 0.9 = 665.1\n\nI should make an offer where I gain more value than my outside option when discounted, and also consider that this is round 2, so I need to make a smart move that is convincing and doesn't just lead to a WALK.\n\nLet's aim for slightly more than my outside option, even after the discount. I need to make a counteroffer to player 1 such that when I keep the remaining resources, it results in a number that is better than my outside offer. My outside offer is 737, and the current round discounted value is 0.9, meaning I would need at least ~819 to make sense. I should keep as much item 5 (value = 99) as possible, then item 3 (value = 40) and then item 1 (value = 16). I can't get to 819 for this round, but I can try to get closer to it in round 3, and the other player may accept it if he values the items less than me.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI should not accept the current offer.\nI should not walk away.\n\nI should make a counteroffer.\n\nI'll make an offer that gives player 1 less than his offer and gives myself more value than my original offer.\nI'll keep [5, 5, 6, 1, 2]. I'll give away [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n*   My value: 5*16 + 5*8 + 6*40 + 1*9 + 2*99 = 80 + 40 + 240 + 9 + 198 = 567\n*   Discounted value: 567 * 0.9 = 510.3\n\nThis value is less than my outside offer, but it is close to the value that I will gain from round 1.\n\n*   I will keep 6, 6, 7, 1, 2. I'll give away 0, 0, 0, 1, 1\n* My value: 6*16 + 6*8 + 7*40 + 1*9 + 2*99 = 96 + 48 + 280 + 9 + 198 = 631\n* Discounted value: 631 * 0.9 = 567.9\n\nI will keep 5, 5, 6, 0, 3. I will give away 1, 1, 1, 2, 0.\n* My Value: 5*16 + 5*8 + 6*40 + 0*9 + 3*99 = 80 + 40 + 240 + 0 + 297 = 657\n* Discounted value: 657 * 0.9 = 591.3\n\nI will keep 6, 6, 7, 0, 3. I will give away 0, 0, 0, 2, 0.\n* My value: 6*16 + 6*8 + 7*40 + 0*9 + 3*99 = 96 + 48 + 280 + 0 + 297 = 721\n* Discounted value: 721 * 0.9 = 648.9\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 401. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 690 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 50 x 5 + 61 x 0 + 75 x 2 + 36 x 0\n    which is 400 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 401. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    55 x 2 + 77 x 0 + 12 x 1 + 79 x 0 + 93 x 0\n    which is 122 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 123. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1127. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 792 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 5, 0, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    61 x 2 + 95 x 5 + 2 x 0 + 88 x 6 + 18 x 0\n    which is 1125 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1127. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1127\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 61, Item 2: 95, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 88, Item 5: 18\n*   **Total pool of items:** 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer now is worth more than accepting the same offer next round because the value is discounted.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value for this offer is: (0 * 61) + (1 * 95) + (0 * 2) + (1 * 88) + (0 * 18) = 95 + 88 = 183.\n\n    This is much less than my outside offer of 1127, so accepting is not a good idea.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1127. Let's try keeping as much as possible while giving some to player 1.\n\n    I have a total value of (2*61) + (5*95) + (1*2) + (6*88) + (1*18) = 122 + 475 + 2 + 528 + 18 = 1145\n\n    Since this is Round 2, I need to consider the discount factor. If I wait until Round 3, my value would be multiplied by 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81. Therefore, it is important to try to get an acceptable deal this round, unless I believe that the other player is likely to offer me almost everything in Round 3.\n   \n    I need to give the player an offer such that the items I keep for myself have a combined value of at least 1127.\n\n    Let's try giving player 1 [2, 2, 1, 3, 1]. That would leave me with: [0, 3, 0, 3, 0]. My value would be: (0 * 61) + (3 * 95) + (0 * 2) + (3 * 88) + (0 * 18) = 0 + 285 + 0 + 264 + 0 = 549. This is no good!\n    \n    To ensure I get a value over 1127, let's try giving away as little as possible initially.\n\n    Let me try to give Player 1 nothing and see what Player 1 will do.\n    I will offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    The value to me is 1145, well over the outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nThe offer [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] yields me only 183, which is far below my outside offer of 1127. Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\nI will propose the counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 6, 7, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    90 x 0 + 13 x 4 + 38 x 6 + 36 x 7 + 63 x 3\n    which is 721 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 722. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]} \n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1) Current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 722.\n   - My private per-unit values are: item1=90, item2=13, item3=38, item4=36, item5=63.\n   - The total pool of items is: 6 of item1, 9 of item2, 6 of item3, 8 of item4, and 4 of item5.\n   - Since we are in round 1, the discount factor \u03b3^(r-1) is 0.9^0 = 1. This means that the full value of any deal today is realized without discount. Delaying for future rounds would start to reduce the present value of any potential outcome.\n   \n2) Assessing offer values:\n   - I must ensure that the retained items (after subtracting what I offer to Player 2) give me a total value that is at least above my outside offer value of 722.\n   - For example, if I propose to offer Player 2 the split [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], then I would keep:\n       \u2022 item1: 6 - 1 = 5 units, value = 5 \u00d7 90 = 450\n       \u2022 item2: 9 - 2 = 7 units, value = 7 \u00d7 13 = 91\n       \u2022 item3: 6 - 1 = 5 units, value = 5 \u00d7 38 = 190\n       \u2022 item4: 8 - 2 = 6 units, value = 6 \u00d7 36 = 216\n       \u2022 item5: 4 - 1 = 3 units, value = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189\n     Total value = 450 + 91 + 190 + 216 + 189 = 1136, which is comfortably above 722.\n     \n3) Decision:\n   - I am not accepting any current offer (since none exists).\n   - I would not walk away because I can secure over 722 value with a suitable division.\n   - I propose the counteroffer [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] where Player 2 gets that many units of each item. This offer avoids the listed negotiation mistakes (it gives me more than my fallback, it isn\u2019t \u201call or nothing,\u201d and it is not a regression from a previous offer since this is the first round).\n   \nThus, my action is to propose the counteroffer as shown above.",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 6, 7, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    90 x 0 + 13 x 4 + 38 x 6 + 36 x 7 + 63 x 3\n    which is 721 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 722. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 8, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 0 + 4 x 0 + 33 x 1 + 9 x 8 + 92 x 3\n    which is 381 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 382. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 2, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 5, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 5, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Still worse than my outside offer.\n\n    *   Let me give [1, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n    *   My value = 4 * 31 + 2 * 70 + 7 * 49 + 2 * 72 + 1 * 55 = 124 + 140 + 343 + 144 + 55 = 806.\n\n    *   Let me give [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n    *   My value = 5 * 31 + 2 * 70 + 8 * 49 + 2 * 72 + 1 * 55 = 155 + 140 + 392 + 144 + 55 = 886.\n    *   Since I am aiming for a value above my outside offer, I should propose a counteroffer that lets me keep everything. That means giving the other player nothing.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 319. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 402 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 4, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 1 + 40 x 2 + 31 x 4 + 51 x 2 + 11 x 1\n    which is 318 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 319. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember Player 1 wants to MAXIMIZE THEIR VALUE.\n    *   I have 1 item 1, 7 item 2, 5 item 3, 8 item 4 and 4 item 5.\n    *   If I keep everything I value the items at 26 * 1 + 22 * 7 + 49 * 5 + 1 * 8 + 33 * 4 = 26 + 154 + 245 + 8 + 132 = 565.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep all of item 3 and item 5, a large portion of item 2, and a fraction of item 1, and some of item 4.\nOffer to Player 1: [0, 3, 0, 4, 0]\nThis would leave me with 1 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 4 of item 4 and 4 of item 5.\nMy value would then be (1*26) + (4*22) + (5*49) + (4*1) + (4*33) = 26 + 88 + 245 + 4 + 132 = 495.\nSince 495 is greater than my outside option of 308, this is a worthwhile offer to make.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible for me.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 308.\n*   My values for items 1 through 5 are 26, 22, 49, 1, and 33 respectively.\n*   The total pool of items is 1, 7, 5, 8, and 4 units respectively.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 7, 0, 8, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  Player 1 keeps 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\n    My value for the current offer is: (0 * 26) + (7 * 22) + (0 * 49) + (8 * 1) + (0 * 33) = 0 + 154 + 0 + 8 + 0 = 162.\n\n    Considering the discount factor: 162 * 0.9 = 145.8. This is less than my outside offer of 308.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to calculate the value of some counteroffers to see if I can get a better deal than my outside offer. I also want to avoid Mistake 1 (making an offer worse than my previous offer). My previous offer was [0, 3, 0, 4, 0], meaning I kept [1, 4, 5, 4, 4].\n    This means I would have gotten (1 * 26) + (4 * 22) + (5 * 49) + (4 * 1) + (4 * 33) = 26 + 88 + 245 + 4 + 132 = 495. With the discount rate, the discounted value of my previous offer is 495 * 0.9 = 445.5. This is significantly higher than my outside offer, and higher than the current deal.\n\nLet's consider keeping at least the items I proposed to keep in round 1: [1, 4, 5, 4, 4].\nThe value is 495, discounted to 445.5.\n\nLet's explore some counteroffers:\n*   Counteroffer 1: Try to get all of item 3. Offer [0, 7, 0, 8, 0] + 1 unit of item 3 = [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]. I keep [1, 0, 4, 0, 4]. The value is: (1 * 26) + (0 * 22) + (4 * 49) + (0 * 1) + (4 * 33) = 26 + 0 + 196 + 0 + 132 = 354. Discounted value is 354 * 0.9 = 318.6. This is better than my outside offer.\n*   Counteroffer 2: Try to get all of item 5. Offer [0, 7, 0, 8, 4]. I keep [1, 0, 5, 0, 0]. The value is: (1 * 26) + (0 * 22) + (5 * 49) + (0 * 1) + (0 * 33) = 26 + 0 + 245 + 0 + 0 = 271. Discounted value is 271 * 0.9 = 243.9. This is worse than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer gives me a discounted value of 145.8, which is less than my outside offer of 308. So, I should not ACCEPT. (Avoids Mistake 4)\n*   I should not WALK away immediately, since I think I can negotiate something higher, and Player 1 seems to be moving in the right direction. (Avoids Mistake 5)\n*   Counteroffer 1 looks promising: [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]. I keep [1, 0, 4, 0, 4], the discounted value is 318.6, which is better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make Counteroffer 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 308. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 393 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 6, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 0 + 22 x 1 + 49 x 3 + 1 x 6 + 33 x 4\n    which is 307 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 308. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 4, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 7, 0, 8, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [0, 7, 0, 7, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 7, 0, 7, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 275. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 771 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 59 x 3 + 53 x 1 + 22 x 2\n    which is 274 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 275. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 432.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 35, item 2 = 57, item 3 = 30, item 4 = 68, item 5 = 27.\n   - The total pool of items is: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 90% of what it would be worth if accepted now in round 2.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]. This means I would receive:\n      - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 35 = 35\n      - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 57 = 57\n      - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 30 = 30\n      - 2 units of item 4: 2 * 68 = 136\n      - 3 units of item 5: 3 * 27 = 81\n      - Total value of current offer: 35 + 57 + 30 + 136 + 81 = 339\n\n      Since 339 < 432, accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a scenario where I keep 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 432. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 651 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 1, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 0 + 57 x 3 + 30 x 1 + 68 x 1 + 27 x 6\n    which is 431 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 432. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 2, 3]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

I must never end up with an offer that, when I tally my own item values, falls below that.\n\u2022 My item values and totals are:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 5 units at 76 each \u2192 380 potential value\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 7 units at 8 each \u2192 56 potential value\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 2 units at 36 each \u2192 72 potential value\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 5 units at 25 each \u2192 125 potential value\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 5 units at 75 each \u2192 375 potential value\n\u2003\u2003Total = 1008.\n\u2022 In this first round (with no counteroffer yet on the table) I can propose an initial counteroffer.\n\u2022 As Player 1 I have full control to propose an offer that gives the opponent some items while keeping nearly all, so that my own computed total is very high compared to 234. However, I must \u201cleave something on the table\u201d so that Player 2 finds the offer somewhat attractive relative to what they might expect (or their unknown outside offer).\n\u2022 I want to maximize my share. I note that Item 2 is worth only 8 per unit to me, so giving these away comes at low cost from my perspective. Also, offering a small amount of a high\u2010value item (e.g., 1 unit of Item 1) could help incentivize Player 2 if they value that item highly.\n\u2022 I therefore propose giving Player 2:\n\u2003\u20031 unit of Item 1 and all 7 units of Item 2,\n\u2003\u2003and nothing of Items 3, 4, and 5.\n\u2022 Under this offer, I would keep:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 5 \u2212 1 = 4 units\u2003\u2192\u20034\u00d776 = 304\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 7 \u2212 7 = 0 units\u2003\u2192\u20030\u00d78 = 0\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: all 2 units\u2003\u2192\u20032\u00d736 = 72\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: all 5 units\u2003\u2192\u20035\u00d725 = 125\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: all 5 units\u2003\u2192\u20035\u00d775 = 375\n\u2003\u2003Total value for me = 304 + 0 + 72 + 125 + 375 = 876, which is way above my fallback of 234.\n\u2022 This division is aggressive in my favor but gives Player 2 an allocation (especially a unit from the high-value Item 1 and the complete Item 2) that might be attractive given uncertainty about their private values. This avoids the pitfalls (like offering below my outside offer or giving nothing) while maximizing my payoff.\n\u2022 Therefore, my action in round 1 is to make the counteroffer with the following numbers representing the items I award to Player 2: [1, 7, 0, 0, 0].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 7, 0, 0, 0]}",

This means they are giving me 1 unit of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  My value for this offer is: (1 * 1) + (7 * 95) + (0 * 23) + (0 * 34) + (0 * 70) = 1 + 665 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 666.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (666) is less than my outside offer (692).\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept it. I also should not walk away immediately, as a better deal might be possible. I need to construct a counteroffer that benefits me.\n\nLet's try to create a counteroffer that is better than my outside option. I need a total value greater than 692. I currently have: 5 of item 1, 7 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 5 of item 5. To get a counteroffer I need to calculate what I keep, calculate its value, and see if it's better than my outside offer.\n\nConsider keeping 0 of item 1, 7 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 5 of item 5. This has a value of (0 * 1) + (7 * 95) + (2 * 23) + (5 * 34) + (5 * 70) = 0 + 665 + 46 + 170 + 350 = 1231. Then I would offer the rest [5, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 1. This has a value of 1231 which is well over my outside offer, so I could potentially give much more to player 1 and still be better off than walking away.\n\nLet's see if I can do even better than the current offer by keeping 0 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 5 of item 5, the total value for which would be (0 * 1) + (5 * 95) + (2 * 23) + (5 * 34) + (5 * 70) = 0 + 475 + 46 + 170 + 350 = 1041 which is greater than 692. This means offering [5,2,0,0,0] to player 1 has a value of 1041 to me.\n\nLet's see if I can get a value of closer to my outside offer so that the other player may be more inclined to accept. Consider keeping 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 5 of item 5, the total value for which would be (0 * 1) + (2 * 95) + (2 * 23) + (5 * 34) + (5 * 70) = 0 + 190 + 46 + 170 + 350 = 756 which is greater than 692. This means offering [5,5,0,0,0] to player 1 has a value of 756 to me.\n\nLet's see if I can get a value even closer. Consider keeping 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 5 of item 5, the total value for which would be (0 * 1) + (1 * 95) + (2 * 23) + (5 * 34) + (5 * 70) = 0 + 95 + 46 + 170 + 350 = 661 which is less than my outside offer, so that won't work.\n\nThus, offering [5,5,0,0,0] is my best counteroffer that I can see.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI will propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 5, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 234. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 234. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 660 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 0 + 8 x 1 + 36 x 0 + 25 x 0 + 75 x 3\n    which is 233 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 234. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I will start by constructing an offer that I think gives me a decent outcome.\n\n* Items offered to Player 1 = [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n* Items I keep: [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n* The value of the items I keep are: 1*52 + 1*9 + 2*58 + 1*85 + 1*33 = 52+9+116+85+33 = 295\n\nThis is also much less than the outside offer, so I need to retain more items.\n\nLet's try offering: [0, 2, 3, 2, 1]\nItems I keep: [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nMy Value = 2 * 52 + 1 * 9 + 1 * 58 + 1 * 85 + 1 * 33 = 104 + 9 + 58 + 85 + 33 = 289.\nStill too low.\n\nLet's try offering [0,0,0,0,0]\nItems I keep: [2,3,4,3,2]\nMy Value = 2 * 52 + 3 * 9 + 4 * 58 + 3 * 85 + 2 * 33 = 104 + 27 + 232 + 255 + 66 = 684.\nThis is my maximum possible value.\n\nOkay, given that the current offer is very bad (152 < 553), and I need to make an offer better than the outside offer (553), and round 1 has just started, I will make an offer that tries to capture as much value as I can.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer gives me only 152, which is much lower than my outside offer of 553. Therefore, I should not accept the current offer.\n\nI will make a counteroffer where I keep everything.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 663. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1050 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 4, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 0 + 67 x 3 + 71 x 4 + 66 x 0 + 87 x 2\n    which is 659 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 663. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. Our outside offer is 663 (guaranteed, no discount). In any negotiated deal the value we get (the raw sum of our kept items) is discounted by 0.9 because we are in round 2. In order for our discounted deal value to beat our outside offer, the raw total we keep must be at least about 663/0.9 \u2248 737.\n\n2. We know the total available items per type are: item 1: 2, item 2: 3, item 3: 4, item 4: 3, item 5: 2, and our private per\u2010unit values are: [59, 67, 71, 66, 87]. Keeping all items gives us a total raw value of 975. In our previous offer (round 1, we proposed [0,1,1,1,0] to Player 2), we would have kept:\n\u2003\u2003item 1: 2 units,\n\u2003\u2003item 2: 3\u20131 = 2,\n\u2003\u2003item 3: 4\u20131 = 3,\n\u2003\u2003item 4: 3\u20131 = 2,\n\u2003\u2003item 5: 2.\n\u2003This yields a raw value of: (2\u00d759) + (2\u00d767) + (3\u00d771) + (2\u00d766) + (2\u00d787) = 118 + 134 + 213 + 132 + 174 = 771.\nIn round 2, with the discount factor the effective value of any agreement we reach will be 0.9\u00d7(raw value).\n\n3. The current offer on the table from Player 2 is [0,0,0,0,0] meaning they are offering us nothing, which is far below our fallback and unacceptable. We must therefore propose a counteroffer.\n\n4. We want to improve our outcome relative to our previous proposal (to avoid making a \u201cworse\u201d offer for ourselves) while ensuring our raw kept value stays above the threshold (~737) so that our discounted value (raw\u00d70.9) remains above our outside offer of 663. \n\n5. By testing a candidate counteroffer such as [0, 1, 1, 0, 0] (i.e. we are offering Player 2 one unit of item 2 and one unit of item 3 and keeping everything else), our kept items become:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2 \u2013 0 = 2,\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 3 \u2013 1 = 2,\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 4 \u2013 1 = 3,\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 3 \u2013 0 = 3,\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2 \u2013 0 = 2.\nThe raw value for our kept items calculates as:\n\u2003\u2003(2\u00d759) + (2\u00d767) + (3\u00d771) + (3\u00d766) + (2\u00d787) = 118 + 134 + 213 + 198 + 174 = 837.\nWhen discounted (837\u00d70.9), our effective value is about 753.3, which is comfortably above our outside offer of 663.\n\n6. This counteroffer improves on our previous proposal by keeping even more value for us (especially in item 4) while still providing a minimal concession to Player 2. It avoids the mistakes of accepting an offer worse than our fallback, proposing a deal that gives away too much, or proposing one that actually lowers our payoff relative to our earlier offer.\n\nBased on this analysis, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 663. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1050 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 4, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 0 + 67 x 3 + 71 x 4 + 66 x 0 + 87 x 2\n    which is 659 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 663. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

My goal is to propose a division in which the items I keep (the complement of what I offer to Player\u202f2) have a total value (using my private item values) above 322.\n\n2.

Since item\u202f5 gives me the highest value (92 per unit), I want to keep as many of those as possible. I can concede some of the items with lower per\u2010unit value to Player\u202f2 to make the proposal acceptable. A nearly \u201cequal\u201d division in my own valuation is a reasonable starting point because it is above my fallback yet might be palatable to Player\u202f2.\n\n4. I considered splitting the items roughly in half.

The offer to Player\u202f2 then is the remaining items:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f1: 0 units \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f2: 2 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f3: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f4: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f5: 1 unit\n\n7.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 19. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 462 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    28 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 16 x 1 + 32 x 0 + 13 x 0\n    which is 16 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 19. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 19\n*   **My values of the items:** Item 1: 28, Item 2: 65, Item 3: 16, Item 4: 32, Item 5: 13\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 0, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   2 units of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n\n    My value for this offer would be: (0 * 28) + (2 * 65) + (1 * 16) + (1 * 32) + (1 * 13) = 0 + 130 + 16 + 32 + 13 = 191\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (191) is much greater than my outside offer (19).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is significantly better than my outside offer, I should consider accepting it. The discount factor is 0.9, so even if I could get slightly more by counteroffering, the risk of the other player walking away or making a worse offer might not be worth it.\n\nTo be absolutely sure, let's consider a potential counteroffer. My goal would be to get a larger share of the items, while still ensuring Player 1 receives enough to avoid them walking away. The total value available is (4*65 + 2*16 + 3*32 + 3*13) = 260+32+96+39=427\nSince Player 1 offered 191, the Player 1's valuation of what they are getting must be somewhat reasonable. Since Player 1 only receives 427 - 191 = 236, it may be best to accept, since they may walk away if I push them to hard.\n\n**Final Decision:** Since the current offer (191) is much greater than my outside offer (19) and to avoid any risk associated with Player 1 rejecting, I will accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 1188\n*   Item values: item 1 = 2, item 2 = 49, item 3 = 70, item 4 = 33, item 5 = 47\n*   Total items: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 5, item 3 = 8, item 4 = 3, item 5 = 6\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: Player 1 offers me [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 2 = 2\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 49 = 49\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 70 = 140\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 33 = 33\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 47 = 94\n    *   Total value of current offer: 2 + 49 + 140 + 33 + 94 = 318\n\n*   Compare to outside offer: 318 < 1188. Accepting the current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   Consider a potential counteroffer. I need to calculate what I would get if I offer Player 1 some amounts of each item. I have 4 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 8 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 6 of item 5.\n\nLet's start by exploring some potential offers. I want to ensure I get at least 1188 in value, so I need to keep a good chunk of the items. Let's try to keep most of the item 3s, item 2s and item 5s:\nSuppose I offer Player 1 [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]. Then I keep:\n*   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3. Value: 3 * 2 = 6\n*   Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4. Value: 4 * 49 = 196\n*   Item 3: 8 - 2 = 6. Value: 6 * 70 = 420\n*   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2. Value: 2 * 33 = 66\n*   Item 5: 6 - 1 = 5. Value: 5 * 47 = 235\n*   Total: 6 + 196 + 420 + 66 + 235 = 923\n923 < 1188, not good enough.\n\nWhat about offering Player 1 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]? This means I keep:\n* Item 1: 4 * 2 = 8\n* Item 2: 5 * 49 = 245\n* Item 3: 7 * 70 = 490\n* Item 4: 3 * 33 = 99\n* Item 5: 6 * 47 = 282\nTotal: 8 + 245 + 490 + 99 + 282 = 1124\nStill less than 1188.\n\nOffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]? That's unlikely to be accepted but let me see if I miscalculated:\n4 * 2 + 5 * 49 + 8 * 70 + 3 * 33 + 6 * 47 = 8 + 245 + 560 + 99 + 282 = 1194.\nOkay, this one is above 1188.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. I definitely shouldn't accept.\nI could walk away, but I want to try to get more than 1188, if possible.\n\nI will make the counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which would allow me to keep everything and results in 1194 value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. The value of this offer to me is: (0 * 2) + (1 * 49) + (0 * 70) + (0 * 33) + (0 * 47) = 49.  Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 49 * 0.9 = 44.1. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 1188.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 1188 / 0.9 = 1320 (the value I need *before* the discount).\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** Accepting the current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider some potential counteroffers: I have 4 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 8 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 6 of item 5.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 911. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 921 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 3, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    44 x 1 + 41 x 0 + 77 x 3 + 45 x 3 + 100 x 5\n    which is 910 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 911. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round. Since we're in the final round, the discount factor is (0.9)^(3-1) = 0.81.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. The value of this offer to me is: (0 * 2) + (1 * 49) + (0 * 70) + (0 * 33) + (1 * 47) = 49 + 47 = 96.  After applying the discount factor, the value of the current offer is 96 * 0.81 = 77.76\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The value of accepting the current offer (77.76) is much less than my outside offer value (1188).

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 0 + 37 x 0 + 84 x 4 + 31 x 1 + 92 x 4\n    which is 735 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 736. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 5, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 5, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 736\n*   My item values: item 1: 70, item 2: 37, item 3: 84, item 4: 31, item 5: 92\n*   Total items: item 1: 3, item 2: 4, item 3: 5, item 4: 6, item 5: 4\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\nThe current offer to me is [0, 0, 5, 1, 0]. This means I get:\n\n*   3 units of item 1: 3 * 70 = 210\n*   4 units of item 2: 4 * 37 = 148\n*   0 units of item 3: 0 * 84 = 0\n*   5 units of item 4: 5 * 31 = 155\n*   4 units of item 5: 4 * 92 = 368\n\nTotal value of accepting the current offer: 210 + 148 + 0 + 155 + 368 = 881\n\n3) **Compare to outside offer:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 881, which is greater than my outside offer of 736.\n\n4) **Consider other possible offers:**\n\nSince the current offer is better than my outside offer, I should consider accepting. However, this is only round 1, and I might get an even better offer later. But, with the discount factor, waiting introduces some risk.\n\nLet's consider a potential counteroffer. I want to find an offer that is better than 736, and which also gives player 1 enough to not walk away. Since Player 1 offered me 5 units of item 3 and 1 unit of item 4, they value them low. So, I will try to give them back the remaining units of Item 3 and Item 4, while retaining the items I value the most.\n\nLet's see if I can offer the other player 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nThis would leave me with:\n\n*   0 units of item 1: 0 * 70 = 0\n*   0 units of item 2: 0 * 37 = 0\n*   5 units of item 3: 5 * 84 = 420\n*   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 31 = 31\n*   4 units of item 5: 4 * 92 = 368\n\nMy total value would be 0 + 0 + 420 + 31 + 368 = 819. This is greater than my outside offer of 736.\nSo I can propose a counteroffer.\n\n5) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is better than my outside offer, but I think I can get more, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 0, 5, 0]}\n```",

This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   0 units of item 2\n    *   5 units of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   0 units of item 5\n    *   My value for this offer is (0 * 70) + (0 * 37) + (5 * 84) + (1 * 31) + (0 * 92) = 0 + 0 + 420 + 31 + 0 = 451.\n    *   Since it is round 2, we need to account for the discount factor. The value of accepting is now 451 * 0.9^(2-1) = 451 * 0.9 = 405.9\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The value of the current offer (405.9) is significantly less than my outside offer (736).\n\n3) **Potential counteroffers:**\n\nI need to calculate the value of keeping certain items and offering the rest to Player 1 to create an offer better than my outside offer. Let's consider an example where I keep all of items 1, 2, and 5, and split items 3 and 4. What offer should I give to Player 1? I will keep 3 of Item 1, 4 of Item 2, 0 of Item 3, 0 of Item 4, and 4 of Item 5. This means I offer Player 1 0 of Item 1, 0 of Item 2, 5 of Item 3, 6 of Item 4, and 0 of Item 5.\n\n*   If I keep [3, 4, 0, 0, 4], my value is (3 * 70) + (4 * 37) + (0 * 84) + (0 * 31) + (4 * 92) = 210 + 148 + 0 + 0 + 368 = 726. Discounted value 726 * 0.9 = 653.4.\n*   This is still less than my outside offer of 736.\n\nLet's create a potential counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer * 0.9 (to account for the discount factor in round 3), which equals 662.4:\n\nI need to obtain at least a value of 662.4 * (1/0.9) = 736 from my items to break even. This will require me to offer Player 1 less. Let's start by keeping all of items 1 and 5. This is already (3 * 70) + (4 * 92) = 210 + 368 = 578. Now let's also keep 2 of item 3. That adds (2 * 84) = 168. So the value for those kept items is 578 + 168 = 746 > 736 (my outside offer). So I need to give the rest to Player 1.\n\nThis would be the counteroffer [0, 4, 3, 6, 0]. The value to me is 746, which discounted by 0.9 is 671.4 which is better than my outside offer.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, and I have devised a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer * 0.9 = 662.4, I should make that counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 3, 6, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 492. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 462 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 2, 6, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 3 + 29 x 2 + 13 x 2 + 18 x 6 + 17 x 4\n    which is 491 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 492. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 5, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 4, 0, 5, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 5, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 4, 3, 6, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 3, 6, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "The total value you derive from all items is 588 if you received all items. However, note that any deal (in round 3) is discounted by gamma^(3\u20131) = 0.9\u00b2 = 0.81. In the best-case scenario you would keep all the items for yourself (worth 588 raw value) which would be worth 588 \u00d7 0.81 \u2248 476.3\u2014still below your outside offer of 492. \n\nLooking at the current offer on the table ([0, 4, 3, 6, 0]), your raw value would be:  \n\u2022 0 of item1: 0 \u00d7 77 = 0  \n\u2022 4 of item2: 4 \u00d7 29 = 116  \n\u2022 3 of item3: 3 \u00d7 13 = 39  \n\u2022 6 of item4: 6 \u00d7 18 = 108  \n\u2022 0 of item5: 0 \u00d7 17 = 0  \nSum = 263 raw value, which when discounted becomes 263 \u00d7 0.81 \u2248 213.\n\nSince even in the best possible deal (i.e. taking everything) you cannot exceed your outside offer, and the current offer is much lower than 492 (even before discounting), any division agreed to in round 3 will yield less than your outside offer. \n\nTherefore, to avoid accepting an outcome that is worse than your private fallback, you should WALK away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 146\n   - Item values: item 1 = 29, item 2 = 16, item 3 = 59, item 4 = 63, item 5 = 77\n   - Total items: 4 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 0 of item 5\n   - Discount factor: 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 of the actual value, compared to the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n     - My value: (1 * 29) + (1 * 16) + (0 * 59) + (0 * 63) + (0 * 77) = 29 + 16 = 45\n     - Discounted value: 45 * 0.9 = 40.5. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 146.\n   - **Previous Offer:** In round 1 I offered Player 1 [3, 2, 2, 0, 0], which means that I would have obtained the allocation [1, 3, 3, 1, 0]. The value of this would have been:\n    - (1*29) + (3*16) + (3*59) + (1*63) + (0*77) = 29 + 48 + 177 + 63 + 0 = 317\n    - Discounted value: 317 * 1 = 317. Player 1 did not accept this offer.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to ensure that any counteroffer I make results in a value greater than 146, discounted by the number of rounds it would take.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer (40.5) is worse than walking away (146).\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 146.\n\nLet's try to create an offer that works. Given that it's round 2, any accepted counteroffer is worth * 0.9. To obtain 146 with discounting, I want a value of 146 / 0.9 = 162.22.\n\nLet me calculate the value if I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means that I will receive the entire pool of items and Player 1 would receive nothing.\n   - My value: (4 * 29) + (5 * 16) + (5 * 59) + (1 * 63) + (0 * 77) = 116 + 80 + 295 + 63 + 0 = 554\n   - This is much greater than the discounted value of 162.22.\n\nLet's try to offer some items, such as [1, 2, 2, 0, 0] to Player 1. Then I get 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 0 of item 5\n    - (3 * 29) + (3 * 16) + (3 * 59) + (1 * 63) + (0 * 77) = 87 + 48 + 177 + 63 + 0 = 375.\n    - Discounted value = 375 * 0.9 = 337.5.\n\nLet's try to offer Player 1 [2, 3, 3, 0, 0]. Then I get 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 0 of item 5\n    - (2 * 29) + (2 * 16) + (2 * 59) + (1 * 63) + (0 * 77) = 58 + 32 + 118 + 63 + 0 = 271\n    - Discounted value = 271 * 0.9 = 243.9.\n\nLet's try to offer Player 1 [3, 4, 4, 0, 0]. Then I get 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 0 of item 5\n    - (1 * 29) + (1 * 16) + (1 * 59) + (1 * 63) + (0 * 77) = 29 + 16 + 59 + 63 + 0 = 167\n    - Discounted value = 167 * 0.9 = 150.3\n\nNow, let's try to offer [3, 5, 4, 0, 0] to Player 1. Then I get 1 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 0 of item 5\n    - (1 * 29) + (0 * 16) + (1 * 59) + (1 * 63) + (0 * 77) = 29 + 0 + 59 + 63 + 0 = 151\n    - Discounted value = 151 * 0.9 = 135.9\n\nI will try the counteroffer [3, 4, 4, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 4, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 146. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 0 + 16 x 5 + 59 x 0 + 63 x 1 + 77 x 0\n    which is 143 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 146. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [3, 4, 4, 0, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2 in round 3.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 146\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 29, Item 2: 16, Item 3: 59, Item 4: 63, Item 5: 77\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 0\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. So, my total value if I accept is: (1 * 29) = 29. Applying the discount factor, the present value is 29 * 0.81 = 23.49.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would keep if I made a counteroffer and whether that value would be better than walking away. Let's consider keeping as much as I can while ensuring the Player 1 receives at least what they asked in their last offer:\n    *   **Counteroffer Example 1:** Offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep all the items: (4 * 29) + (5 * 16) + (5 * 59) + (1 * 63) + (0 * 77) = 116 + 80 + 295 + 63 + 0 = 554. Applying the discount factor: 554 * 0.81 = 448.74\n    *   **Counteroffer Example 2:** Offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]. This means I keep (3 * 29) + (4 * 16) + (4 * 59) + (0 * 63) + (0 * 77) = 87 + 64 + 236 + 0 + 0 = 387. Applying the discount factor: 387 * 0.81 = 313.47\n    *   **Counteroffer Example 3:** Offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This means I keep (3 * 29) + (4 * 16) + (4 * 59) + (1 * 63) + (0 * 77) = 87 + 64 + 236 + 63 + 0 = 450. Applying the discount factor: 450 * 0.81 = 364.5\n    *   **Counteroffer Example 4:** Offer Player 1 [4, 5, 5, 1, 0]. This means I keep (0 * 29) + (0 * 16) + (0 * 59) + (0 * 63) + (0 * 77) = 0. Applying the discount factor: 0 * 0.81 = 0\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    * Accepting the current offer gives me a discounted value of 23.49, which is much worse than my outside offer of 146.\n    * Several counteroffers, especially the one where I offer nothing, result in discounted values much larger than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is not beneficial, as it provides a value significantly lower than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away guarantees me my outside offer of 146.\n*   Making a counteroffer where I get to keep the majority of items yields a much larger value, even after applying the discount factor.\n*   I will make the counteroffer where I offer nothing: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 842. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 660 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 2, 0, 5, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 5 + 83 x 2 + 2 x 0 + 53 x 5 + 1 x 5\n    which is 841 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 842. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means Player 1 keeps 5 of Item 1, 2 of Item 2, 8 of Item 3, 6 of Item 4, and 6 of Item 5.\n    *   My value if I accept: (1 * 81) + (0 * 83) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 53) + (1 * 1) = 81 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 82. This is much less than my outside offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer where what I keep is worth more than 842.\n    *   Let's try to find a division where I get a lot of the valuable items (1, 2, and 4) and give away items 3 and 5.\n        *   If I keep [5, 2, 6, 0, 0], the value is (5 * 81) + (2 * 83) + (6 * 53) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 1) = 405 + 166 + 318 + 0 + 0 = 889. Giving the other player [1, 0, 8, 6, 7] is now a valid counteroffer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 82, which is far less than my outside offer of 842.\n*   Walking away guarantees me 842.\n*   I can make a counteroffer where I keep a large portion of the valuable items and get more than 842, which is worth more than my outside offer.\n*   Therefore, I should make the counteroffer [1, 0, 8, 6, 7] in order to potentially receive a better deal.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 8, 6, 7]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 0 + 75 x 0 + 24 x 0 + 41 x 1 + 25 x 2\n    which is 91 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 95. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n    *   Current offer: Player 1 offers me [1, 1, 0, 1, 3]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 57) + (1 * 75) + (0 * 24) + (1 * 41) + (3 * 25) = 57 + 75 + 0 + 41 + 75 = 248. This is much higher than my outside offer.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   The current offer is worth 248, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 95. Therefore, accepting the current offer is a good option.\n\n    Based on this analysis, my best course of action is to accept the offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This means an agreement in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its undiscounted value to each player, and round 3 is worth 0.9^2 times the undiscounted value.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 23) + (0 * 84) + (0 * 97) + (1 * 60) + (0 * 11) = 60.\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 60 * 0.9 = 54.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 54, which is much less than my outside offer of 434. Accepting would be a Mistake 4.\n\nNow, let's consider potential counteroffers. I need to keep enough items to be worth more than 434.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Give Player 1 nothing.** I keep [6, 4, 1, 2, 4].\n    *   Value: (6 * 23) + (4 * 84) + (1 * 97) + (2 * 60) + (4 * 11) = 138 + 336 + 97 + 120 + 44 = 735\n    *   Offer to Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Offer a minimal amount, while retaining at least 434 worth of value for myself.** Since item 5 has the lowest value for me, I'll try giving player 1 the maximum number of item 5s possible. I also want to give away Item 1, since this also has low value for me. The offer from Round 1 from Player 1 was [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], perhaps this will be sufficient.\n    *   Value: (6 * 23) + (4 * 84) + (1 * 97) + (1 * 60) + (4 * 11) = 138 + 336 + 97 + 60 + 44 = 675\n    *   Offer to Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nIf I make an offer of zero items to player 1, or even a small number of low value items, my value to me remains much higher than 434, even accounting for the discount factor of 0.9. My value for the current offer from Player 1 is so low that even accepting it in the final round is worse than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. Walking away guarantees me 434.\n\nSince I want to maximize my potential value and avoid a quick walk, I am making a counteroffer.\nI am going to offer them close to nothing to see if I can extract value while avoiding a walk.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 1, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 1 + 42 x 3 + 96 x 1 + 6 x 2 + 43 x 3\n    which is 434 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 435. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 23 x 0 + 41 x 0 + 46 x 4 + 87 x 4\n    which is 532 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 536. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 536\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 63, Item 2: 23, Item 3: 41, Item 4: 46, Item 5: 87\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 0, Item 2: 0, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer later is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 1, 3, 2]. This means I get:\n    *   Item 1: 0 - 0 = 0\n    *   Item 2: 0 - 0 = 0\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 3 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2\n*   **Value of current offer:** (0 * 63) + (0 * 23) + (3 * 41) + (2 * 46) + (2 * 87) = 0 + 0 + 123 + 92 + 174 = 389\n\n3) **Compare to outside offer:**\n\n*   The current offer (389) is less than my outside offer (536).\n\n4) **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 536. I need to figure out what to offer Player 1 so that what's left for me is worth more than 536. The total value of all items to me is (0 * 63) + (0 * 23) + (4 * 41) + (5 * 46) + (4 * 87) = 0 + 0 + 164 + 230 + 348 = 742.\n\nLet's try to construct an offer where I keep a good amount of Item 5.\n\n* Keep all of Items 5, 4 and 3: Player 1 gets 0 Items 3, 0 Items 4, and 0 Items 5.\n* My value is: (4 * 41) + (5 * 46) + (4 * 87) = 164 + 230 + 348 = 742. In this case, I need to let Player 1 have *something*, otherwise, it'll be a mistake 3, offering 0.\n* It doesn't matter which item I reduce to 0 for myself, since there are none of items 1 and 2!\n* Let's assume Player 1 gets only item 3. To ensure it's a valid offer, then I can offer 1 unit of item 3 to player 1 and keep 3 items.\n\nMy offer to Player 1: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nI get:\n*   Item 1: 0 - 0 = 0\n*   Item 2: 0 - 0 = 0\n*   Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3\n*   Item 4: 5 - 0 = 5\n*   Item 5: 4 - 0 = 4\n*   My Value: 0 + 0 + (3*41) + (5*46) + (4*87) = 123 + 230 + 348 = 701.\n\nIf I only give Player 1, 2 units of Item 3.\nMy offer to Player 1: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nI get:\n*   Item 1: 0 - 0 = 0\n*   Item 2: 0 - 0 = 0\n*   Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2\n*   Item 4: 5 - 0 = 5\n*   Item 5: 4 - 0 = 4\n*   My Value: 0 + 0 + (2*41) + (5*46) + (4*87) = 82 + 230 + 348 = 660.\n\nIf I only give Player 1, 3 units of Item 3.\nMy offer to Player 1: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\nI get:\n*   Item 1: 0 - 0 = 0\n*   Item 2: 0 - 0 = 0\n*   Item 3: 4 - 3 = 1\n*   Item 4: 5 - 0 = 5\n*   Item 5: 4 - 0 = 4\n*   My Value: 0 + 0 + (1*41) + (5*46) + (4*87) = 41 + 230 + 348 = 619.\n\nGiving away the items 4, 5 to the Player 1 and keeping 3 doesn't give me the optimal value. Hence, let's stick to giving away 1 Item 3 to the player.\nMy offer to Player 1: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] and My Value: 701.\n\n5) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is 389, my outside offer is 536, and my counteroffer of [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] gives me 701. Since 701 > 536, I should make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

If I demand [0, 0, 3, 2, 2], my value would be\n3 * 41 + 2 * 46 + 2 * 87 = 123 + 92 + 174 = 389\nThis is still smaller than my outside offer. After the discount, this will be 389 * 0.9 = 350.1.\n\nLet's try keeping [0, 0, 4, 5, 4]\nMy value = 4 * 41 + 5 * 46 + 4 * 87 = 164 + 230 + 348 = 742. This would be a much better position.\nI would be offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. But offering nothing might lead to a walk.\n\nLet's make an offer slightly better than my outside offer.\nLet me give Player 1 one unit of item 4. My offer is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] to Player 1.\nI will get [0, 0, 4, 4, 4] items.\nMy value = 4 * 41 + 4 * 46 + 4 * 87 = 164 + 184 + 348 = 696\nValue after discounting will be 696 * 0.9 = 626.4, which is greater than 536.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n   - Offering [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] to player 1 seems better.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 366. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1008 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 0 + 37 x 0 + 65 x 4 + 51 x 2 + 88 x 0\n    which is 362 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 366. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 701. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1050 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 0 + 41 x 3 + 75 x 1 + 95 x 2 + 52 x 6\n    which is 700 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 701. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less to me than an offer accepted now.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.  The value to me is:\n        (0 \\* 87) + (1 \\* 41) + (0 \\* 75) + (0 \\* 95) + (1 \\* 52) = 0 + 41 + 0 + 0 + 52 = 93\n\n    *   **Comparing to outside offer:** 93 is much less than my outside offer of 701. Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake.\n\n    *   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what a reasonable counteroffer might look like.  I want to maximize my value while also giving Player 1 enough to make them accept. I will start by calculating the total value of all items:\n\n        (4 \\* 87) + (5 \\* 41) + (5 \\* 75) + (4 \\* 95) + (6 \\* 52) = 348 + 205 + 375 + 380 + 312 = 1620\n\n        Since it is the first round, I will make a counteroffer. I will try to make a counteroffer where I keep at least half of the total value.\n\n        Let's start with a simple split and see what value Player 1 gets: I offer player 1 [2, 2, 2, 2, 3]. Then I keep [2, 3, 3, 2, 3].\n        My value = (2 * 87) + (3 * 41) + (3 * 75) + (2 * 95) + (3 * 52) = 174 + 123 + 225 + 190 + 156 = 868\n        Since 868 > 701 (my outside offer) this is better than walking away\n\n3.  **Make a decision:**\n    I should propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 2, 3]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 321. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 609 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 0 + 53 x 0 + 4 x 2 + 29 x 1 + 94 x 3\n    which is 319 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 321. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 321\n   - Item values: item 1 = 23, item 2 = 53, item 3 = 4, item 4 = 29, item 5 = 94\n   - Total items: 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.  This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n     - My value for accepting the current offer: (0 * 23) + (0 * 53) + (0 * 4) + (1 * 29) + (0 * 94) = 29. This is much less than my outside offer of 321.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to figure out a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, if possible, or at least gets me closer to it, while also giving Player 1 enough to accept.\n     - If I keep all the items, my value is: (1 * 23) + (3 * 53) + (3 * 4) + (3 * 29) + (4 * 94) = 23 + 159 + 12 + 87 + 376 = 657\n     - I need to keep items with a value greater than 321.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer (value 29) is much worse than my outside offer (321). So, I should not accept.\n   - Walking away gives me 321. I will try a counteroffer first.\n   - I want to find an offer for Player 1 that gives me at least 321. I need to keep at least this much value for myself.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\n*   I keep: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n*   My value: (1 * 23) + (2 * 53) + (2 * 4) + (2 * 29) + (3 * 94) = 23 + 106 + 8 + 58 + 282 = 477\n\nThis is greater than 321.\n\nThe offer to Player 1 would be [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Let's assume player 1 values are roughly the same, then this offer should be good enough for them to agree and better than walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

Although I could try to \u201cpinch\u201d Player 2 by keeping most of the high\u2010valued items, I must also give them enough to have an incentive to reach an agreement. In my private value function, item 3 is particularly high (90 per unit), so I want to keep all 6 units of item 3. For the other items I can split in a way that leaves me with a very strong outcome relative to my outside offer:\n\u2003\u2013 For item 1 (2 units total), I offer 1 unit to Player 2 and keep 1.\n\u2003\u2013 For item 2 (6 units), I offer 3 units to Player 2 and keep 3.\n\u2003\u2013 For item 3 (6 units), I offer 0 units to Player 2 and keep all 6.\n\u2003\u2013 For item 4 (6 units), I offer 3 units to Player 2 and keep 3.\n\u2003\u2013 For item 5 (3 units), I offer 1 unit to Player 2 and keep 2.\n\u2003This yields me the kept bundle: [1, 3, 6, 3, 2].\n\n3.

Since there is no current offer on the table and I\u2019m the first mover in round 1, proposing this counteroffer secures a high-value outcome for me while still giving Player 2 a nonzero share.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 729. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 729. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 561 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 5, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 0 + 50 x 6 + 63 x 5 + 7 x 3 + 46 x 2\n    which is 728 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 729. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 729\n*   **Item values:** Item 1 = 21, Item 2 = 50, Item 3 = 63, Item 4 = 7, Item 5 = 46\n*   **Total items:** 2 of Item 1, 6 of Item 2, 6 of Item 3, 6 of Item 4, 3 of Item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** You are offered [1, 3, 0, 3, 1]. This means you get 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. To calculate the value of this offer:\n    (1 * 21) + (3 * 50) + (0 * 63) + (3 * 7) + (1 * 46) = 21 + 150 + 0 + 21 + 46 = 238\n\n*   **Items you keep if you accept the current offer:** If you accept the current offer of [1, 3, 0, 3, 1], it means Player 1 gets [1, 3, 6, 3, 2] (the total amount minus the current offer). This means you would keep: \n    * Item 1: 2 - 1 = 1\n    * Item 2: 6 - 3 = 3\n    * Item 3: 6 - 0 = 6\n    * Item 4: 6 - 3 = 3\n    * Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n    The value of this offer is (1 * 21) + (3 * 50) + (6 * 63) + (3 * 7) + (2 * 46) = 21 + 150 + 378 + 21 + 92 = 662. This value represents your total value if player 1 got [1, 3, 6, 3, 2]. The current offered value is 238, this value represents what the offer is worth to you, but ultimately the decision is based on what you would be left with which is calculated by taking the totals of each item minus what you give to player 1.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The value of the items you would keep is 662, which is less than your outside offer of 729. Therefore, accepting this offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since the offer on the table isn't great, let's explore making a counteroffer. The counteroffer needs to ensure you get a total value greater than your outside offer of 729.\n\nLet's try and make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a little less than the current offer, maybe starting with keeping one more item of item 3.\nCounteroffer of [1, 3, 5, 3, 1]. This means you would keep [1, 3, 1, 3, 2]. The value would be: (1 * 21) + (3 * 50) + (1 * 63) + (3 * 7) + (2 * 46) = 21 + 150 + 63 + 21 + 92 = 347.\n\nWe know from above that you would keep [1, 3, 6, 3, 2] in your above analysis on the current offer. \nNow we need to calculate the current value of your offer if you counteroffer. It's important to do this so you avoid Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. It's important to ensure that your counteroffer makes you better off than if you were to accept the current offer (which is 238).\nThe current offer would result in you having:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 0\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 1\nfor a value of 238.\n\nSo we need to create a counteroffer that leaves player 1 with an item distribution that results in you receiving greater than 238. And greater than 729.\n\nLet's try an offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] so you keep everything\n(2 * 21) + (6 * 50) + (6 * 63) + (6 * 7) + (3 * 46) = 42 + 300 + 378 + 42 + 138 = 900\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept it. It's round 1, so there's time to make a counteroffer. Let's make a bold counteroffer to try and claim as much value as possible by offering nothing initially.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: [1, 3, 0, 3, 1] (what Player 1 is offering to me)\n   - If I accept the current offer, my value is:\n      - Item 1: 1 * 21 = 21\n      - Item 2: 3 * 50 = 150\n      - Item 3: 0 * 63 = 0\n      - Item 4: 3 * 7 = 21\n      - Item 5: 1 * 46 = 46\n      - Total value = 21 + 150 + 0 + 21 + 46 = 238\n   - This value (238) is much less than my outside offer of 729.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer. I need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer value. Player 1 is offering me a very bad deal.\n\nI have 2 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 6 of item 4 and 3 of item 5.\n\nLet's consider what would happen if I gave nothing and kept everything for myself:\nItem 1: 2 * 21 = 42\nItem 2: 6 * 50 = 300\nItem 3: 6 * 63 = 378\nItem 4: 6 * 7 = 42\nItem 5: 3 * 46 = 138\nTotal: 42 + 300 + 378 + 42 + 138 = 900\n\nClearly, keeping everything is much better than my outside offer.\n\nI could propose to give Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThis gives me a value of 900.\n\nAlternatively, I could give slightly more. I'll give one unit of item 4.\n\nValue to me is:\nItem 1: 2 * 21 = 42\nItem 2: 6 * 50 = 300\nItem 3: 6 * 63 = 378\nItem 4: 5 * 7 = 35\nItem 5: 3 * 46 = 138\nTotal = 42 + 300 + 378 + 35 + 138 = 893\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer (238) is far worse than my outside offer (729). I should not accept it.\nGiving Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] will yield 900 for me. This is better than my outside offer, and ensures I don't make mistake #2.\nWalking away would give me 729.\n\nNow I should factor in the discount of 0.9. If I expect to get an outcome of 900 next round, it will be worth only 900 * 0.9 = 810. Since 810 > 729, it may be worth making a reasonable counteroffer rather than walking away.\n\nLet's try offering [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I keep 5 units of item 3.\nValue to me:\nItem 1: 2 * 21 = 42\nItem 2: 6 * 50 = 300\nItem 3: 5 * 63 = 315\nItem 4: 6 * 7 = 42\nItem 5: 3 * 46 = 138\nTotal: 42 + 300 + 315 + 42 + 138 = 837\nSince 837 * 0.9 > 729, I should make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

Since it's round 1, the discount factor doesn't affect the current evaluation.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 3, 0, 6, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   3 units of item 2\n    *   0 units of item 3\n    *   6 units of item 4\n    *   0 units of item 5\n    The total value of this offer to me is: (0 * 27) + (3 * 32) + (0 * 14) + (6 * 59) + (0 * 52) = 0 + 96 + 0 + 354 + 0 = 450.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (450) is better than my outside offer (364).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is better than my outside offer, I should consider accepting it. However, it's only round 1, and I might be able to get a better deal. Let's explore a potential counteroffer to see if I can get a better outcome.\n\nTo start, let's calculate my total value of all items:\n(4 * 27) + (3 * 32) + (4 * 14) + (6 * 59) + (4 * 52) = 108 + 96 + 56 + 354 + 208 = 822.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I offer player 1 half of each item, rounding down where necessary:\n* Item 1: 4/2 = 2\n* Item 2: 3/2 = 1\n* Item 3: 4/2 = 2\n* Item 4: 6/2 = 3\n* Item 5: 4/2 = 2\n\nMy counteroffer will be [2, 1, 2, 3, 2]. This means I keep:\n* Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n* Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2\n* Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2\n* Item 4: 6 - 3 = 3\n* Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2\n\nThe value of this to me is (2 * 27) + (2 * 32) + (2 * 14) + (3 * 59) + (2 * 52) = 54 + 64 + 28 + 177 + 104 = 427.\n\n427 is greater than my outside option of 364. This seems better than accepting Player 1's current offer, but I can try to be a bit more greedy since its only round 1.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n\nThis means I keep:\n* Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n* Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3\n* Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3\n* Item 4: 6 - 2 = 4\n* Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n\nThe value of this to me is (3 * 27) + (3 * 32) + (3 * 14) + (4 * 59) + (3 * 52) = 81 + 96 + 42 + 236 + 156 = 611.\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer and Player 1's initial offer, and leaves them with something of value as well.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer [1, 0, 1, 2, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 6, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 364\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 27, Item 2: 32, Item 3: 14, Item 4: 59, Item 5: 52\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 6, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers [0, 3, 0, 2, 0]. This means I receive:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 3 = 0\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 0 = 4\n    *   Item 4: 6 - 2 = 4\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 0 = 4\n    *   Total value: (4 * 27) + (0 * 32) + (4 * 14) + (4 * 59) + (4 * 52) = 108 + 0 + 56 + 236 + 208 = 608\n    *   Discounted value: 608 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 608 * 0.9 = 547.2\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 547.2 > 364, so accepting the current offer is better than walking away *right now*.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider if a counteroffer could yield a higher *discounted* value than accepting the current offer. It's round 2, so the discount factor is 0.9.\n\nLet's consider offering player 1 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]. This would leave me with [4, 1, 4, 6, 4]. The value is then:\n\n* Value = (4 * 27) + (1 * 32) + (4 * 14) + (6 * 59) + (4 * 52) = 108 + 32 + 56 + 354 + 208 = 758\n* Discounted Value = 758 * 0.9 = 682.2\n\nSince 682.2 is greater than 547.2, it's worth making a counteroffer.\n\nLet's try giving more item 4, as I see higher value in it. Consider offering Player 1: [0, 3, 0, 4, 0]\nThis leaves me with [4, 0, 4, 2, 4].\n\nValue = (4 * 27) + (0 * 32) + (4 * 14) + (2 * 59) + (4 * 52) = 108 + 0 + 56 + 118 + 208 = 490\nDiscounted Value = 490 * 0.9 = 441\n\nEven though this is more than the outside offer, this is less than the current offer I have available of 547.2. Therefore it is best to simply accept the offer, I will achieve the most value that way.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe discounted value of the current offer is significantly higher than my outside offer. While I could try to squeeze out a bit more with a counteroffer, the risk of it being rejected and ending up with my outside offer in the next round outweighs the potential gain, especially considering the discount factor.\n\nTherefore, the optimal decision is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Current situation:\n   \u2022 My outside offer is 811.\n   \u2022 My private per\u2010unit values are: item1=28, item2=71, item3=58, item4=18, item5=95.\n   \u2022 The total available amounts are: item1: 2, item2: 5, item3: 2, item4: 6, item5: 4.\n   \u2022 Since we\u2019re in round 1 (no discount yet), any deal yields its full (undiscounted) value. Accepting a proposal later would discount my payoff by the factor gamma raised to (round\u20131), so acting now avoids delay.\n\n2. Offer assessment and design:\n   \u2022 I must ensure that the value I retain (i.e. what I keep for myself when dividing the items) is at least 811 (better than my outside offer).\n   \u2022 My total full value is 1015 if I keep everything. I can \u201cgive away\u201d up to 1015 \u2013 811 = 204 points of value.\n   \u2022 I prefer to concede items that are less valuable to me. Since my per\u2010unit valuation is lowest for item4 (18 per unit), giving those away is attractive.\n   \u2022 For example, if I give away all 6 units of item4, I lose 6\u00d718=108 value. I then have 204\u2013108=96 points of value left I can concede.\n   \u2022 I can also give away one unit of item1 (28 points) and one unit of item3 (58 points). That sums to 28+58 = 86, which added to 108 equals 194 (still under the concession limit of 204).\n\n3. Calculation of my remaining value:\n   \u2022 Items I keep if I offer [1, 0, 1, 6, 0] (meaning I offer to Player 2: 1 of item1, 0 of item2, 1 of item3, 6 of item4, 0 of item5):\n     \u2013 Item1: I keep 2\u20131 = 1 unit \u2192 1\u00d728 = 28.\n     \u2013 Item2: I keep all 5 units \u2192 5\u00d771 = 355.\n     \u2013 Item3: I keep 2\u20131 = 1 unit \u2192 1\u00d758 = 58.\n     \u2013 Item4: I keep 6\u20136 = 0 units \u2192 0\u00d718 = 0.\n     \u2013 Item5: I keep all 4 units \u2192 4\u00d795 = 380.\n   \u2022 Total value for me = 28 + 355 + 58 + 0 + 380 = 821, which is above the fallback of 811.\n\n4. Final decision:\n   \u2022 The offer [1, 0, 1, 6, 0] gives me a payoff of 821 while conceding items whose value sums to 194 (within the safe bound of 204).\n   \u2022 This proposal avoids offering a deal worse than my outside option and does not make any of the five outlined mistakes.\n\nBased on this analysis, my action is to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 6, 0]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 2, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 53 x 4 + 94 x 2 + 18 x 2 + 61 x 3\n    which is 619 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 620. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 6, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 6, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 620\n   - My item values: item 1 = 1, item 2 = 53, item 3 = 94, item 4 = 18, item 5 = 61\n   - Total items: 2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 6 of item 4, 4 of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 0, 1, 6, 0]. This means I get:\n      - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 1 = 1\n      - 0 units of item 2: 0 * 53 = 0\n      - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 94 = 94\n      - 6 units of item 4: 6 * 18 = 108\n      - 0 units of item 5: 0 * 61 = 0\n      - Total value: 1 + 0 + 94 + 108 + 0 = 203\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 203 is much less than my outside offer of 620. Accepting is a bad idea.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me at least 620 value. I have:\n      - 2 units of item 1\n      - 5 units of item 2\n      - 2 units of item 3\n      - 6 units of item 4\n      - 4 units of item 5\n\n      Let's try keeping everything for myself and offering nothing to Player 1. This would mean offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1. My value would then be:\n      - 2 * 1 + 5 * 53 + 2 * 94 + 6 * 18 + 4 * 61 = 2 + 265 + 188 + 108 + 244 = 807.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer is terrible.\n   - My outside offer is better than the current offer.\n   - Keeping everything is my best option right now.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer that significantly favors me.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 75. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 669 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 40 x 0 + 16 x 1 + 28 x 2 + 76 x 0\n    which is 72 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 75. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that the value of an offer in round 2 is multiplied by 0.9, and in round 3 by 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I receive 1 unit of each item. My value for this offer is: (1 * 10) + (1 * 52) + (1 * 77) + (1 * 41) + (1 * 16) = 10 + 52 + 77 + 41 + 16 = 196.\n   - This value (196) is less than my outside offer of 526.\n\n3) **Consider potential counteroffers:**\nLet's start by calculating the total value of all the items to me:\n(3 * 10) + (3 * 52) + (2 * 77) + (4 * 41) + (3 * 16) = 30 + 156 + 154 + 164 + 48 = 552.\n\nI want to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 526. That means I can give the other player a maximum of 552-526 = 26 in value. \nIf I give the other player [2, 2, 0, 0, 0], then I keep [1, 1, 2, 4, 3], which gives me 10 + 52 + 154 + 164 + 48 = 428 which is worse than my walkaway.\nIf I give the other player [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], then I keep [3, 3, 2, 3, 3], which gives me 30 + 156 + 154 + 123 + 48 = 511 which is still worse than my walkaway.\n\nLet's try giving the other player almost everything and only keeping items that are relatively valuable.\n\nI should consider making a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a significant portion of the less valuable items, while I retain more of the high-value items. I'll need to give Player 1 an amount such that I am better off than just taking my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider the counteroffer where I give Player 1 the following: [3, 3, 0, 4, 3] leaving nothing for myself in Item 3 and Item 5. \nThis would result in me having 0 of item 1 worth 10 * 0 = 0,  0 of item 2 worth 52 * 0 = 0, 2 of item 3 worth 77 * 2 = 154, 0 of item 4 worth 41 * 0 = 0, and 0 of item 5 worth 16 * 0 = 0. This would give me a total of 154.\n\nAnother option is for me to give [0,0,0,0,0]. Then, my value would be 552.\nSo, the other player would give me 196.\nWhat if I give the player [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Then my value is 552-77= 475.\n\nI will try to give the other player all of item 1 and item 5. \nMy offer is: [3, 0, 0, 0, 3]\nThen I am left with 0 + 3 * 52 + 2 * 77 + 4 * 41 + 0 = 0 + 156 + 154 + 164 + 0 = 474.\nThis is not better than my walkaway.\n\nI'm not seeing an obvious counteroffer that benefits me significantly more than my outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 6, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 0 + 20 x 3 + 60 x 6 + 26 x 0 + 28 x 3\n    which is 504 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 505. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 505\n*   My item values: item 1 = 33, item 2 = 20, item 3 = 60, item 4 = 26, item 5 = 28\n*   Total item pool: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means waiting for a later round reduces the value of any deal.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 1 unit of item 1. My value would be 1 * 33 = 33. This is much less than my outside offer of 505.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine a counteroffer that yields a value greater than 505. I have:\n    *   4 units of item 1\n    *   3 units of item 2\n    *   6 units of item 3\n    *   3 units of item 4\n    *   3 units of item 5\n\nLet's calculate the value of keeping all the items for myself: (4 * 33) + (3 * 20) + (6 * 60) + (3 * 26) + (3 * 28) = 132 + 60 + 360 + 78 + 84 = 714.\n\nLet's find an offer where I give away some items but still keep at least my outside offer value. For example, I can offer Player 1 one unit of item 1, zero units of item 2, zero units of item 3, one unit of item 4, and zero units of item 5. My value would then be (3 * 33) + (3 * 20) + (6 * 60) + (2 * 26) + (3 * 28) = 99 + 60 + 360 + 52 + 84 = 655.\n\nI need to iterate more to find a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept but is still better than my outside offer. Let's propose the following offer to Player 1: [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I would keep 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nMy value = (3 * 33) + (3 * 20) + (5 * 60) + (3 * 26) + (3 * 28) = 99 + 60 + 300 + 78 + 84 = 621.\n\nI can propose to offer Player 1 one unit of item 1, one unit of item 2, one unit of item 3, zero units of item 4, zero units of item 5.\nMy value would be (3 * 33) + (2 * 20) + (5 * 60) + (3 * 26) + (3 * 28) = 99 + 40 + 300 + 78 + 84 = 601.\n\nLet's try offering [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]. My value = (4 * 33) + (2 * 20) + (5 * 60) + (3 * 26) + (3 * 28) = 132 + 40 + 300 + 78 + 84 = 634.\n\nLet's try offering [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. My value = (3 * 33) + (2 * 20) + (5 * 60) + (2 * 26) + (2 * 28) = 99 + 40 + 300 + 52 + 56 = 547\n\nLet's try offering [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. My value = (3 * 33) + (2 * 20) + (6 * 60) + (3 * 26) + (3 * 28) = 99 + 40 + 360 + 78 + 84 = 661\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] is unacceptable because it's far below my outside offer. I will make a counteroffer to try to reach a better outcome. Offering [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] gives me a value of 661.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 441. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 603 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 5, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 1 + 25 x 0 + 32 x 5 + 27 x 1 + 68 x 3\n    which is 440 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 441. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 3, 1, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 6 + 43 x 3 + 2 x 1 + 71 x 2 + 16 x 0\n    which is 567 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 569. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

To maximize my value, I want to keep as many high\u2010value items as possible while offering Player\u00a02 some units from items I value less. Item\u202f3 is my lowest\u2010valued item (28 per unit), so handing all 6 units of item3 to Player\u00a02 minimizes the cost to me.\n4. However, offering absolutely nothing for the other items can be seen as a \u201cno\u2010offer\u201d mistake. Thus, I add a small concession: giving 1 unit of item2 (valued at 67) to Player\u00a02.\n5. Under that counteroffer, my retained counts would be: item1: 3 (3\u20130), item2: 3 (4\u20131), item3: 0 (6\u20136), item4: 5 (5\u20130), item5: 3 (3\u20130). My total value would then be: (3\u00d754) + (3\u00d767) + (0\u00d728) + (5\u00d797) + (3\u00d761) = 162 + 201 + 0 + 485 + 183 = 1031, which is well above my outside offer of 531.\n6.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 4, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    31 x 4 + 58 x 0 + 65 x 4 + 44 x 6 + 43 x 3\n    which is 777 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 790. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 503. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 6, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 0 + 88 x 1 + 31 x 6 + 42 x 2 + 48 x 3\n    which is 502 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 503. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 78 x 0 + 22 x 1 + 74 x 0 + 19 x 0\n    which is 22 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 30. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 1, 6]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 67. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 678 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 1 + 2 x 2 + 5 x 3 + 95 x 0 + 77 x 0\n    which is 66 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 67. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1418. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1062 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 6, 3, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 3 + 99 x 6 + 74 x 3 + 94 x 3 + 29 x 5\n    which is 1417 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1418. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 2, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 7, 8, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 4 + 67 x 7 + 72 x 8 + 75 x 5 + 58 x 0\n    which is 1580 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1597. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 1, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 5, 1, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 0 + 58 x 1 + 35 x 0 + 60 x 1 + 87 x 0\n    which is 118 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 119. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 418. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 909 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 0, 7, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 1 + 54 x 2 + 92 x 0 + 36 x 7 + 64 x 0\n    which is 417 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 418. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "My reasoning:\n\n1. My outside offer is 418. I must ensure any deal I propose gives me more than 418 in value.\n2.

If I offer Player 2 only minimal quantities, I keep most of the available items. However, offering absolutely nothing to the opponent (or all items to them) is not ideal in early rounds (to avoid Mistake 3 and to maintain negotiation momentum).\n4. I choose to offer Player 2 1 unit each of items 1, 2, 4, and 5, and 0 of item 3. This results in:\n   \u2022 Player 2 gets: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n   \u2022 I keep: [6, 2, 1, 6, 1]\n5. Calculating my value for the kept items:\n   \u2022 Item 1: 6 \u00d7 57 = 342\n   \u2022 Item 2: 2 \u00d7 54 = 108\n   \u2022 Item 3: 1 \u00d7 92 = 92\n   \u2022 Item 4: 6 \u00d7 36 = 216\n   \u2022 Item 5: 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n   Total value = 342 + 108 + 92 + 216 + 64 = 822, which is well above my outside offer of 418.\n6.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 812. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 678 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 4, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 2 + 45 x 3 + 79 x 4 + 36 x 5 + 47 x 3\n    which is 810 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 812. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "My reasoning is as follows:\n\n\u2022 Outside offer: My fallback guarantee is 543.\n\u2022 My total value for all items (if I took everything) is 698.\n\u2022 My per\u2010unit values are: 17 for items 1 and 2, 77 for item 3, 52 for item 4, and 44 for item 5. This means items 1 and 2 are relatively low in value to me, so I can consider conceding some of these in order to give the opponent an appealing offer.\n\u2022 The total available items are: 6 of item1, 5 of item2, 3 of item3, 2 of item4, and 4 of item5.\n\u2022 Because we are in round 1 (with discount factor \u03b3 = 0.9, but no discount is applied in round 1), I want to immediately propose a division that gives me an outcome strictly better than my outside offer.\n\u2022 One plan is to concede part of the low\u2010valued items (items 1 and 2) while keeping all of my more valuable items (items 3, 4, and 5). For example, if I propose to give the opponent 3 units of item 1 and 2 units of item 2, my kept allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 6 \u2013 3 = 3 units (3\u00d717 = 51)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 5 \u2013 2 = 3 units (3\u00d717 = 51)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 3 units (3\u00d777 = 231)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 2 units (2\u00d752 = 104)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 4 units (4\u00d744 = 176)\n\u2003\u2003The sum for my kept items is 51 + 51 + 231 + 104 + 176 = 613, which is above my outside value (543).\n\u2022 This offer avoids the mistakes of dropping below my fallback, of giving away too many of my higher\u2010value items, and offers a nontrivial share to the opponent. Therefore, my proposed counteroffer is to offer the opponent: [3, 2, 0, 0, 0] (which means giving 3 units of item 1 and 2 units of item 2 to Player 2, and keeping all of items 3, 4, and 5).\n\nBased on this analysis, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 0, 0, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 1, 2, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 0, 1, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 4 + 18 x 2 + 20 x 0 + 55 x 1 + 35 x 7\n    which is 396 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 397. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 8]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 2, 8]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 2, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 4 + 20 x 5 + 22 x 2 + 55 x 5 + 77 x 3\n    which is 858 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 859. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 4, 2, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 5 + 93 x 4 + 30 x 2 + 88 x 4 + 9 x 5\n    which is 1264 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1265. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 5, 8, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 4 + 7 x 3 + 59 x 5 + 14 x 8 + 93 x 3\n    which is 871 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 875. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 393. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 0 + 71 x 1 + 95 x 3 + 30 x 0 + 36 x 1\n    which is 392 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 393. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 6, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 1 + 14 x 2 + 76 x 6 + 35 x 3 + 56 x 1\n    which is 668 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 669. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 4, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 4, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 5, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 1 + 24 x 3 + 100 x 5 + 44 x 4 + 41 x 4\n    which is 922 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 926. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 4 + 19 x 1 + 68 x 0 + 60 x 0 + 74 x 0\n    which is 43 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 44. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 4, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 4, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 0 + 62 x 0 + 33 x 0 + 20 x 0 + 55 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 6. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 2, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 4 + 54 x 0 + 36 x 2 + 63 x 2 + 13 x 2\n    which is 232 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 233. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                {
                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 59 for item 1, 100 for item 2, 39 for item 3, 71 for item 4, 48 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1165. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 583. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 583. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 951 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 6, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 0 + 100 x 3 + 39 x 6 + 71 x 0 + 48 x 1\n    which is 582 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 583. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.
