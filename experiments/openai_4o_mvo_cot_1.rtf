Game 1, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 31 for item 1, 31 for item 2, 36 for item 3, 6 for item 4, 39 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 538. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 94. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 94. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 429 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 94.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 11 for item 1, 90 for item 2, 3 for item 3, 36 for item 4, 46 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 487. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 407. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 407. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 558 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 407.\

================================================================================\
Game 2, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 60 for item 1, 64 for item 2, 41 for item 3, 47 for item 4, 32 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1037. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 802. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 802. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 802.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

First, I calculate the total value if I keep all items:\\n\\n- Keeping all items:\\n  - 7 units of item 1: 7 \\u00d7 60 = 420\\n  - 3 units of item 2: 3 \\u00d7 64 = 192\\n  - 5 units of item 3: 5 \\u00d7 41 = 205\\n  - 4 units of item 4: 4 \\u00d7 47 = 188\\n  - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \\u00d7 32 = 32\\n  - Total value = 420 + 192 + 205 + 188 + 32 = 1037\\n\\nSince the maximum possible value (1037) is higher than my outside offer (802), I should make a counteroffer that gives me a total close to or greater than 802, preferably much higher to account for any future negotiation rounds where discounting applies.\\n\\n### Counteroffer Strategy\\nLet\\u2019s consider offering Player 2 a small but reasonable amount of items such that my total value exceeds 802 significantly.\\n\\n- **Counteroffer 1**: Give Player 2 a minimal amount of items:\\n  - Offer 2 units of item 1 (keeping 5 for myself)\\n  - Offer 1 unit of item 2 (keeping 2 for myself)\\n  - Offer 2 units of item 3 (keeping 3 for myself)\\n  - Offer 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 3 for myself)\\n  - Offer 0 units of item 5 (keeping 1 for myself)\\n\\nCalculation of my value with this counteroffer:\\n- 5 units of item 1: 5 \\u00d7 60 = 300\\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \\u00d7 64 = 128\\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \\u00d7 41 = 123\\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \\u00d7 47 = 141\\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \\u00d7 32 = 32\\n- Total value = 300 + 128 + 123 + 141 + 32 = 724\\n\\nThis offer results in a value of 724, which is less than 802. Therefore, I need to adjust to maintain more value or offer less.\\n    \\n- **Counteroffer 2**: A more generous offer while trying to maximize my value:\\n  - Offer 1 unit of item 1 (keeping 6 for myself)\\n  - Offer 0 units of item 2 (keeping all 3 for myself)\\n  - Offer 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 4 for myself)\\n  - Offer 0 units of item 4 (keeping all 4 for myself)\\n  - Offer 0 units of item 5 (keeping 1 for myself)\\n\\nCalculation of my value with this counteroffer:\\n- 6 units of item 1: 6 \\u00d7 60 = 360\\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \\u00d7 64 = 192\\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \\u00d7 41 = 164\\n- 4 units of item 4: 4 \\u00d7 47 = 188\\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \\u00d7 32 = 32\\n- Total value = 360 + 192 + 164 + 188 + 32 = 936\\n\\nThis ensures that my total value is well above 802, creating a strong negotiation position.\\n\\n### Step 3: Decide the Action\\nSince the value from Counteroffer 2 is 936, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 802, and given we are in the first round without discount factor affecting negotiations, I should go ahead and make this counteroffer.\\n\\n```json\\n\{\\"action\\": \\"COUNTEROFFER\\", \\"offer\\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\}\\n```",\

Game 2, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 19 for item 1, 49 for item 2, 99 for item 3, 15 for item 4, 13 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 848. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 780. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 780. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 585 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 780.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Game 3, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 7 for item 1, 58 for item 2, 21 for item 3, 70 for item 4, 11 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 381. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 376. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 376. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 501 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 376.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 2 for item 1, 15 for item 2, 81 for item 3, 54 for item 4, 32 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 492. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 377. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 377. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 552 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 377.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    Your private values are 7 for item 1, 58 for item 2, 21 for item 3, 70 for item 4, 11 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 381. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 376. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 501 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 376.\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 32 for item 1, 71 for item 2, 96 for item 3, 5 for item 4, 6 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 773. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 592. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 592. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 630 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 592.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 24 for item 1, 17 for item 2, 61 for item 3, 10 for item 4, 62 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 619. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 87. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 522 (sum of all item values)\

Game 5, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 20 for item 1, 54 for item 2, 36 for item 3, 26 for item 4, 3 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 726. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 69. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 69. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 417 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 69.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

Game 6, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 65 for item 1, 7 for item 2, 96 for item 3, 17 for item 4, 55 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 951. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 27. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 27. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 720 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 27.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 44 for item 1, 4 for item 2, 63 for item 3, 56 for item 4, 98 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1396. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 986. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 986. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 986.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 62 for item 1, 73 for item 2, 86 for item 3, 51 for item 4, 43 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1370. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 605. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 605. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 945 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 605.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

\
================================================================================\
Game 7, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 44 for item 1, 4 for item 2, 63 for item 3, 56 for item 4, 98 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1396. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 986. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 986. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 986.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1370. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 605. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 81 for item 1, 8 for item 2, 18 for item 3, 36 for item 4, 79 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 542. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 81. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 81. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 666 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 81.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 21 for item 1, 48 for item 2, 36 for item 3, 63 for item 4, 24 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 594. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 286. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 286. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 576 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 286.\
\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1284. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 997. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 997. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 876 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 997.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 46 for item 1, 22 for item 2, 97 for item 3, 64 for item 4, 4 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1012. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 218. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 218. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 699 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 218.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 40 for item 1, 24 for item 2, 56 for item 3, 18 for item 4, 12 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 642. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 65. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 65. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 450 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 65.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 10, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 68 for item 1, 81 for item 2, 35 for item 3, 96 for item 4, 36 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1375. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 205. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 205. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 948 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 205.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 47 for item 1, 62 for item 2, 31 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 8 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 705. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 329. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 329. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 621 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 329.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\

Round 1 Values:\

================================================================================\
Game 11, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 47 for item 1, 62 for item 2, 31 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 8 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 705. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 329. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 329. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 621 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 329.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 986. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 670. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 32 for item 1, 64 for item 2, 97 for item 3, 4 for item 4, 21 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1070. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 789. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 789. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 654 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 789.\

    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \

    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 25 for item 1, 92 for item 2, 91 for item 3, 90 for item 4, 9 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1178. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 853. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 853. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 921 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 853.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    Your outside offer value is 789. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 654 (sum of all item values)\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1178. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 853. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 853. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 921 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 853.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 0, 2, 2]\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 23 for item 1, 96 for item 2, 95 for item 3, 41 for item 4, 5 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 714. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 402. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 402. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 780 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 402.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    Your private values are 21 for item 1, 28 for item 2, 100 for item 3, 31 for item 4, 55 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 609. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 65. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 65. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 65.\
\

Player 2: 316.80\

================================================================================\
Game 13, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 23 for item 1, 96 for item 2, 95 for item 3, 41 for item 4, 5 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 714. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 402. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 402. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 780 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 402.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [4, 2, 0, 2, 1]\

Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 2, 0, 2, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\

    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 609. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 65. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 9 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 59 for item 1, 18 for item 2, 100 for item 3, 13 for item 4, 18 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 399. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 358. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 358. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 624 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 358.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\

Game 15, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 32 for item 1, 47 for item 2, 1 for item 3, 92 for item 4, 96 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1171. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 876. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 876. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 804 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 876.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 61 for item 1, 62 for item 2, 38 for item 3, 51 for item 4, 60 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 692. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 246. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 246. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 816 (sum of all item values)\

Game 16, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 87 for item 1, 58 for item 2, 56 for item 3, 64 for item 4, 63 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 902. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 89. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 89. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 984 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 89.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 75 for item 1, 58 for item 2, 95 for item 3, 7 for item 4, 17 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1396. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 457. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 457. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 756 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 457.\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

================================================================================\
Game 17, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 75 for item 1, 58 for item 2, 95 for item 3, 7 for item 4, 17 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1396. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 457. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 457. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 756 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 457.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 49 for item 1, 77 for item 2, 83 for item 3, 78 for item 4, 12 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1259. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 222. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 222. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 897 (sum of all item values)\

    This would be greater than your outside offer of 222.\

Game 19, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 100 for item 1, 31 for item 2, 88 for item 3, 36 for item 4, 79 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1258. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 518. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 518. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1002 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 518.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 79 for item 1, 57 for item 2, 26 for item 3, 32 for item 4, 100 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1313. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1068. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1068. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 882 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1068.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\

    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    2) Then, let's calculate:\

    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\

\
    3) Let's decide:\

    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1002 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 518.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 79 for item 1, 57 for item 2, 26 for item 3, 32 for item 4, 100 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1313. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1068. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1068. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 882 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1068.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\

Game 20, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 7 for item 1, 9 for item 2, 53 for item 3, 7 for item 4, 73 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 678. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 183. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 183. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 447 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 183.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\

Game 20, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 2 for item 1, 40 for item 2, 13 for item 3, 65 for item 4, 30 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 862. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 723. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 723. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 450 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 723.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Let's construct a counteroffer that focuses on maximizing my value:\\n\\nExample Counteroffer: [3, 0, 1, 3, 0]\\n- My units would be:\\n  - 3 units of item 1: \\\\( 3 \\\\times 41 = 123 \\\\)\\n  - 1 unit of item 2: \\\\( 0 \\\\times 11 = 0 \\\\)\\n  - 1 unit of item 3: \\\\( 1 \\\\times 13 = 13 \\\\)\\n  - 3 units of item 4: \\\\( 3 \\\\times 4 = 12 \\\\)\\n  - 4 units of item 5: \\\\( 4 \\\\times 96 = 384 \\\\)\\n  \\n- Total value of counteroffer to me = \\\\( 123 + 0 + 13 + 12 + 384 = 532 \\\\)\\n\\nThis total is significantly greater than my outside offer of 257, making it a very beneficial counteroffer for me.\\n\\n**Therefore, my action is to make the following counteroffer:**\\n\\n```json\\n\{\\"action\\": \\"COUNTEROFFER\\", \\"offer\\": [3, 0, 1, 3, 0]\}\\n```",\

Game 21, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 46 for item 1, 32 for item 2, 67 for item 3, 87 for item 4, 90 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1324. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 551. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 551. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 966 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 551.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 2, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 1, 3, 0]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 1, 3, 0]\
    \

Game 22, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 78 for item 1, 79 for item 2, 52 for item 3, 36 for item 4, 61 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 621. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 6. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 6. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 918 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 6.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Your outside offer value is 26. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\

Game 23, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 18 for item 1, 41 for item 2, 27 for item 3, 18 for item 4, 84 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 398. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 341. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 341. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 564 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 341.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 46 for item 1, 65 for item 2, 50 for item 3, 75 for item 4, 49 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 776. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 52. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 52. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 855 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 52.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 24, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 60 for item 1, 12 for item 2, 41 for item 3, 43 for item 4, 50 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 589. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 65. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 65. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 618 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 65.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 10 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 65 for item 1, 5 for item 2, 40 for item 3, 17 for item 4, 22 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 980. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 584. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 584. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 447 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 584.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\

Game 26, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 17 for item 1, 54 for item 2, 46 for item 3, 75 for item 4, 25 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 938. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 722. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 722. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 651 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 722.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

I should try to keep more value by altering the counteroffer to reach a better outcome. Let's try one where the division tilts further in my favor:\\n\\nTry this allocation:\\n\\n- 0 units of item 1 giving me 2 units (34)\\n- 2 units of item 2 giving me 4 units (216)\\n- 1 unit of item 3 giving me 4 units (184)\\n- 1 unit of item 4 giving me 3 units (225)\\n- 1 unit of item 5 giving me 1 unit (25)\\n\\nTotal value to me = 34 + 216 + 184 + 225 + 25 = 684\\n\\nThis example is closer but still doesn't exceed 722 by a sufficient margin.

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 53 for item 1, 26 for item 2, 58 for item 3, 6 for item 4, 92 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 783. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 12. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 12. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 12.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

================================================================================\
Game 27, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 53 for item 1, 26 for item 2, 58 for item 3, 6 for item 4, 92 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 783. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 12. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 12. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 12.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

Game 28, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 3 for item 1, 45 for item 2, 78 for item 3, 79 for item 4, 8 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 933. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 492. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 492. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 639 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 492.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 49 for item 1, 73 for item 2, 74 for item 3, 27 for item 4, 61 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1126. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 127. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 127. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 852 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 127.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

Game 29, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 47 for item 1, 45 for item 2, 85 for item 3, 22 for item 4, 12 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 666. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 13. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 13. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 633 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 13.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 20 for item 1, 14 for item 2, 51 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 92 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 751. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 626. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 626. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 626.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 55 for item 1, 37 for item 2, 93 for item 3, 22 for item 4, 37 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 986. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 533. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 533. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 533.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\

Game 30, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 20 for item 1, 14 for item 2, 51 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 92 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 751. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 626. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 626. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 626.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 2]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [5, 3, 1, 1, 1]\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 25 for item 1, 47 for item 2, 55 for item 3, 91 for item 4, 16 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 940. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 544. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 544. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 702 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 544.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 73 for item 1, 98 for item 2, 53 for item 3, 87 for item 4, 78 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1331. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 397. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 397. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1167 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 397.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 32, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 24 for item 1, 100 for item 2, 21 for item 3, 48 for item 4, 20 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 956. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 213. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 213. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 639 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 213.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 10 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 90 for item 1, 12 for item 2, 72 for item 3, 38 for item 4, 96 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1700. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 286. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 286. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 286.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\

Game 33, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 10 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 3 for item 1, 54 for item 2, 27 for item 3, 21 for item 4, 88 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1408. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1167. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1167. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 579 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1167.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 2, 1]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 2, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    Your private values are 90 for item 1, 12 for item 2, 72 for item 3, 38 for item 4, 96 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1700. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 286. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 286. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 286.\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 72 for item 1, 44 for item 2, 90 for item 3, 68 for item 4, 93 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1725. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 296. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 296. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1101 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 296.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    Let's solve this step by step:\

    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 74 for item 1, 28 for item 2, 7 for item 3, 90 for item 4, 96 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1387. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 164. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 164. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 885 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 164.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

================================================================================\
Game 35, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 64 for item 1, 72 for item 2, 51 for item 3, 72 for item 4, 12 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1104. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 557. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 557. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 557.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 4, 1, 5]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 3, 5]\

Let's refine a bit more:\\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 64\\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 216\\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 153\\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 144\\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0\\n     - Total value = 577\\n     - Discount-adjusted value = 577 \\u00d7 0.9 = 519.3, still slightly less, but shows we are close.\\n   - Therefore, an offer that is advantageous but considerably fair to Player 2 could be given item values to balance close to break-even point.\\n\\nSince my straightforward offers do not exceed my outside offer value, it would make sense to secure the outside offer value or attempt a slightly adjusted approach to seek mutual agreement advantage.

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 77 for item 1, 16 for item 2, 79 for item 3, 1 for item 4, 7 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 651. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 391. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 391. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 540 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 391.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 912 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 84.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 5 for item 1, 38 for item 2, 51 for item 3, 43 for item 4, 62 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 604. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 463. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 463. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 597 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 463.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 59 for item 1, 87 for item 2, 42 for item 3, 67 for item 4, 25 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1375. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 739. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 67 for item 1, 76 for item 2, 34 for item 3, 6 for item 4, 95 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1143. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 991. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 991. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 834 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 991.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 2, 1]\
    \

    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 59 for item 1, 87 for item 2, 42 for item 3, 67 for item 4, 25 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1375. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 739. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 739. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 840 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 739.\
\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 26 for item 1, 8 for item 2, 96 for item 3, 55 for item 4, 32 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 688. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 489. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 489. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 651 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 489.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    2) Then, let's calculate:\

    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\

\
    3) Let's decide:\

Game 38, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 74 for item 1, 93 for item 2, 94 for item 3, 39 for item 4, 16 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 909. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 826. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 826. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 948 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 826.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Game 39, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 86 for item 1, 91 for item 2, 15 for item 3, 58 for item 4, 3 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 400. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 63. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 63. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 759 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 63.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 31 for item 1, 96 for item 2, 97 for item 3, 97 for item 4, 38 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1680. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1370. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1370. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1077 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1370.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\

    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 41, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 91 for item 1, 48 for item 2, 56 for item 3, 99 for item 4, 14 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1121. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 641. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 641. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 641.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 22 for item 1, 79 for item 2, 36 for item 3, 26 for item 4, 28 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 598. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 323. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 323. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 573 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 323.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 87 for item 1, 60 for item 2, 6 for item 3, 97 for item 4, 5 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1158. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 334. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 334. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 765 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 334.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 334. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 765 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 334.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 99 for item 1, 2 for item 2, 76 for item 3, 27 for item 4, 45 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 983. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 529. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 529. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 747 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 529.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\

\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    Your outside offer value is 456. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 456. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 669 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 456.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 51 for item 1, 32 for item 2, 51 for item 3, 46 for item 4, 30 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 946. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 48. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 48. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 630 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 48.\

Game 46, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 65 for item 1, 25 for item 2, 83 for item 3, 92 for item 4, 15 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 964. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 209. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 209. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 840 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 209.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 57 for item 1, 10 for item 2, 90 for item 3, 24 for item 4, 52 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 605. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 164. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

================================================================================\
Game 47, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 57 for item 1, 10 for item 2, 90 for item 3, 24 for item 4, 52 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 605. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 164. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 164. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 699 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 164.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 0, 2, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 10 for item 1, 29 for item 2, 81 for item 3, 16 for item 4, 98 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1216. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 360. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 100 for item 1, 74 for item 2, 58 for item 3, 73 for item 4, 52 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 2024. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1828. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1828. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1071 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1828.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1216. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 360. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 702 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 360.\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 2024. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1828. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1828. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1071 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1828.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 5 for item 1, 24 for item 2, 92 for item 3, 100 for item 4, 18 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 705. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 436. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 436. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 717 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 436.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 846. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 304. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

Game 50, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 34 for item 1, 60 for item 2, 61 for item 3, 82 for item 4, 39 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1099. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 683. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 683. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 828 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 683.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 30 for item 1, 55 for item 2, 16 for item 3, 86 for item 4, 25 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 696. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 287. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 287. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 636 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 287.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 10 for item 1, 14 for item 2, 57 for item 3, 28 for item 4, 29 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 459. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 116. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 116. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 414 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 116.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 26 for item 1, 82 for item 2, 98 for item 3, 23 for item 4, 24 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1095. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 256. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 256. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 759 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 256.\

    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\

Game 53, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 40 for item 1, 24 for item 2, 71 for item 3, 21 for item 4, 64 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 911. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 805. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 805. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 660 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 805.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 58 for item 1, 27 for item 2, 31 for item 3, 43 for item 4, 13 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 713. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 415. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 415. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 516 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 415.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1197. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 100. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 100. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 100.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 90 for item 1, 87 for item 2, 19 for item 3, 96 for item 4, 69 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1527. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 369. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 369. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1083 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 369.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 56, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 59 for item 1, 91 for item 2, 4 for item 3, 75 for item 4, 88 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1349. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 41. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 41. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 951 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 41.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 86 for item 1, 39 for item 2, 83 for item 3, 77 for item 4, 66 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1398. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1132. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1132. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1053 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1132.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 63 for item 1, 83 for item 2, 14 for item 3, 52 for item 4, 82 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 690. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 294. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 294. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

Game 57, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 29 for item 1, 9 for item 2, 25 for item 3, 85 for item 4, 60 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 456. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 370. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 370. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 624 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 370.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    Your outside offer value is 294. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 294. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 882 (sum of all item values)\

    This would be greater than your outside offer of 294.\

    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

        "content": "To decide on the appropriate action, let's break down the scenario step by step:\\n\\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\\n\\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is valued at 773.\\n- **Item Values to Me:**\\n  - Item 1: 48 per unit\\n  - Item 2: 69 per unit\\n  - Item 3: 59 per unit\\n  - Item 4: 94 per unit\\n  - Item 5: 40 per unit\\n- **Current Offer:** None (This is the first move, so there's no existing offer on the table).\\n- **Current Round and Discount Factor:** We are in round 1, and there is no discount for this round as \\\\(\\\\gamma^\{(1-1)\} = 1\\\\).\\n\\n### Step 2: Calculate Values\\n\\n- **My Total Value if I Accept the Current Offer:** There's no current offer, so nothing to calculate here.\\n\\n- **Potential Counteroffers:** To ensure making an offer that's significant for me, my total value from any counteroffer I make should be greater than 773.\\n\\n- **Offer Consideration:**\\n  - Let's consider offering Player 2 a minimal number of items that still ensures I have more than my outside offer.\\n  \\nFor example, I can calculate the value if I only take 0 units of each item, which clearly is 0 value, so I plan to start with an aggressive offer strategy:\\n\\n- Assume:\\n  - I can initially take 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. \\n  - This gives Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\\n\\n- **Calculate My Value:**\\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \\u00d7 48 = 192\\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \\u00d7 69 = 0\\n  - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \\u00d7 59 = 295\\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \\u00d7 94 = 188\\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \\u00d7 40 = 0\\n  - Total value = 192 + 0 + 295 + 188 + 0 = 675\\n\\nSince 675 is less than my outside offer of 773, I need a slightly more favorable deal.\\n\\n### Step 3: Decision\\n\\nI need an allocation more beneficial to me. Let's counteroffer while keeping at least one unit of item 2. For example:\\n\\nOffering Player 2: \\n- Give 1 unit of item 1: I keep 4\\n- Give 1 unit of item 2: I keep 0\\n- Give 2 units of item 3: I keep 4 \\n- Give 1 unit of item 4: I keep 2\\n- Give 0 units of item 5: I keep 1\\n\\n- **My New Value:**\\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \\u00d7 48 = 192\\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \\u00d7 69 = 0\\n  - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \\u00d7 59 = 236\\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \\u00d7 94 = 188\\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \\u00d7 40 = 40\\n  - Total new value = 192 + 0 + 236 + 188 + 40 = 656\\n\\nThis is still below 773, but due to player dynamics and ensuring no overly one-sided proposal, I'll aim to control a little more to see if Player 2 improves the offer.\\n\\n**Given this scenario, the best action is to make the following counteroffer:**\\n\\n```json\\n\{\\"action\\": \\"COUNTEROFFER\\", \\"offer\\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\}\\n```\\n\\nThis keeps the understanding of sharing but lets me see if adjusting further aligns closer, and allows time for dynamics next round. Adjust further in next rounds if needed.",\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 87 for item 1, 14 for item 2, 21 for item 3, 14 for item 4, 76 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 693. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 87. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 87. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 636 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 87.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    Your outside offer value is 417. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1024. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 783. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 783. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 570 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 783.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 90 for item 1, 78 for item 2, 27 for item 3, 81 for item 4, 81 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1668. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 417. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 417. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1071 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 417.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\

Walking away with the outside offer gives me a guaranteed value of 783, which is currently higher than the value I would get from the offer on the table.\\n\\n#### Calculating a Potential Counteroffer:\\nFor a counteroffer to be better, the value must exceed 783 (after applying the discount factor). Even retaining most items still might not reach 783 due to the discount. A quick check would be:\\n\\n- Keeping as many high-value items (like item 3) to exceed a value considering the discount might still strain to reach above 783 unless Player 1 is willing to accept a division where I get the vast majority of the items\\u2014an unlikely scenario.\\n\\nGiven it's the second round, and Player 1's willingness based on previous counteroffers, arriving at an agreeable division seems difficult without risking losing the higher outside offer.\\n\\nTherefore, the most strategic move is to walk away with the better guaranteed value.\\n\\n```json\\n\{\\"action\\": \\"WALK\\"\}\\n```",\

================================================================================\
Game 60, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 10 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 2 for item 1, 30 for item 2, 15 for item 3, 14 for item 4, 38 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 385. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 224. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 224. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 297 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 224.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 55 for item 1, 6 for item 2, 14 for item 3, 71 for item 4, 82 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1238. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 182. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 182. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 684 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 182.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 14 for item 1, 71 for item 2, 88 for item 3, 97 for item 4, 95 for item 5.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 60 for item 1, 57 for item 2, 90 for item 3, 39 for item 4, 90 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1404. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 243. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 243. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1008 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 243.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1615. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1068. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1068. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1095 (sum of all item values)\

    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 14 for item 1, 71 for item 2, 88 for item 3, 97 for item 4, 95 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1615. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1068. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1068. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1095 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 1068.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\

    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\

\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 62, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 1 for item 1, 86 for item 2, 35 for item 3, 98 for item 4, 44 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1144. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 354. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 354. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 792 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 354.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 0]\

    \
    What is your action? You can:\

    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 78 for item 1, 11 for item 2, 68 for item 3, 36 for item 4, 74 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 908. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 175. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\

    This would be greater than your outside offer of 175.\

Game 64, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 89 for item 1, 93 for item 2, 93 for item 3, 35 for item 4, 11 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1471. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 418. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 418. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 963 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 418.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

Game 65, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 3 for item 1, 34 for item 2, 3 for item 3, 54 for item 4, 84 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 928. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 763. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 763. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 534 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 763.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

    \

    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 71 for item 1, 94 for item 2, 23 for item 3, 89 for item 4, 84 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1841. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1634. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

Game 66, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 94 for item 1, 20 for item 2, 11 for item 3, 67 for item 4, 49 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 571. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 562. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 562. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 723 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 562.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 22 for item 1, 42 for item 2, 67 for item 3, 84 for item 4, 61 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 734. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 551. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 551. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 828 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 551.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 11 for item 1, 59 for item 2, 80 for item 3, 50 for item 4, 36 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 737. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 298. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 298. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 298.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 69 for item 1, 1 for item 2, 85 for item 3, 34 for item 4, 38 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 780. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 154. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 154.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 64 for item 1, 51 for item 2, 21 for item 3, 95 for item 4, 13 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1302. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 904. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 904. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 904.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 98 for item 1, 18 for item 2, 77 for item 3, 6 for item 4, 34 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1334. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 584. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 584. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 699 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 584.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 1 for item 1, 85 for item 2, 57 for item 3, 96 for item 4, 1 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1012. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 530. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 530. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 720 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 530.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    3) Let's decide:\

Game 70, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 1 for item 1, 85 for item 2, 57 for item 3, 96 for item 4, 1 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1012. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 530. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 530. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 720 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 530.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 5, 0, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 2, 0]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 2, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 971. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\

Game 71, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 4 for item 1, 82 for item 2, 98 for item 3, 56 for item 4, 78 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1220. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 57. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 57. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 954 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 57.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 20 for item 1, 49 for item 2, 65 for item 3, 97 for item 4, 7 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1160. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 103. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 103. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 714 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 103.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 52 for item 1, 12 for item 2, 7 for item 3, 50 for item 4, 98 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 851. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 797. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 797. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 797.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 85 for item 1, 26 for item 2, 30 for item 3, 10 for item 4, 100 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1075. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 311. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 311. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 753 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 311.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 13 for item 1, 13 for item 2, 82 for item 3, 82 for item 4, 7 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 580. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 555. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 555. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 591 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 555.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 74, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 10 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 5 for item 1, 66 for item 2, 68 for item 3, 19 for item 4, 61 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1148. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 987. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 987. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 987.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 5 for item 1, 79 for item 2, 40 for item 3, 99 for item 4, 78 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1411. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 982. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 982. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 903 (sum of all item values)\

    This would be less than your outside offer of 982.\

================================================================================\
Game 74, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 10 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 5 for item 1, 66 for item 2, 68 for item 3, 19 for item 4, 61 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1148. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 987. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 987. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 987.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 2, 0, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 26 for item 1, 89 for item 2, 73 for item 3, 9 for item 4, 63 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1051. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1038. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1038. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 780 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1038.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 83 for item 1, 30 for item 2, 13 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 50 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 503. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 252. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\

    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 31 for item 1, 79 for item 2, 40 for item 3, 38 for item 4, 61 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 836. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 687. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 687. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 747 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 687.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 83 for item 1, 30 for item 2, 13 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 50 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 503. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 252. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 252. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 252.\
\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\

    Your outside offer value is 687. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 687. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 747 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 687.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 89 for item 1, 83 for item 2, 72 for item 3, 85 for item 4, 93 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1280. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 163. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 163. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1266 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 163.\

================================================================================\
Game 77, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 89 for item 1, 83 for item 2, 72 for item 3, 85 for item 4, 93 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1280. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 163. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 163. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1266 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 163.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 3]\

Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 2, 3]\
    \

    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 0 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 56 for item 1, 34 for item 2, 93 for item 3, 2 for item 4, 33 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 493. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 304. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 304. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 654 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 304.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\

    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\

\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 0 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 32 for item 1, 99 for item 2, 6 for item 3, 51 for item 4, 29 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 795. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 660. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 660. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 651 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 660.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\

    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\

Game 79, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 51 for item 1, 83 for item 2, 51 for item 3, 85 for item 4, 43 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1012. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 222. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 222. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 939 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 222.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Your private values are 9 for item 1, 63 for item 2, 64 for item 3, 91 for item 4, 96 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1091. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 778. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

Game 79, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 9 for item 1, 63 for item 2, 64 for item 3, 91 for item 4, 96 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1091. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 778. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 778. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 969 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 778.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 1, 2]\
    \

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 68 for item 1, 13 for item 2, 93 for item 3, 29 for item 4, 59 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 847. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 424. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 424. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 786 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 424.\

    Your outside offer value is 303. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 303. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 435 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 303.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 68 for item 1, 13 for item 2, 93 for item 3, 29 for item 4, 59 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 847. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 424. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 424. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 786 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 424.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 762. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 762.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

I need to generate a counteroffer that ensures my value is at least 762, which is my outside offer value.\\n\\nLet's calculate the value for several possible allocations by keeping as many high-valued items as I can:\\n\\n**Attempt 1 - Get Most Valuable Items:**\\n- Keep all 3 units of Item 4, as it's worth the most to me. Value: \\\\(3 \\\\times 68 = 204\\\\).\\n- Keep all units of Item 2 next, as it's the second most valuable, though limited quantity: 4 units.

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 51 for item 1, 34 for item 2, 75 for item 3, 4 for item 4, 7 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1126. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 102. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 102. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 513 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 102.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\

    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\

    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 1 for item 1, 10 for item 2, 28 for item 3, 92 for item 4, 33 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 738. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 366. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 366. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 492 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 366.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    2) Then, let's calculate:\

\
    3) Let's decide:\

Game 82, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 37 for item 1, 16 for item 2, 14 for item 3, 10 for item 4, 38 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 448. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 212. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 212. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 345 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 212.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 76 for item 1, 72 for item 2, 62 for item 3, 1 for item 4, 83 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1553. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1045. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1045. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 882 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1045.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

================================================================================\
Game 83, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 76 for item 1, 72 for item 2, 62 for item 3, 1 for item 4, 83 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1553. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1045. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1045. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 882 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1045.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 5, 5, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 2, 0]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 2, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

================================================================================\
Game 84, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 59 for item 1, 48 for item 2, 2 for item 3, 49 for item 4, 3 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 751. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 255. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 255. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 483 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 255.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 39 for item 1, 99 for item 2, 52 for item 3, 94 for item 4, 8 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1345. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 957. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 957. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 876 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 957.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

================================================================================\
Game 84, Round 3, Player 1's turn (Step 5)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 59 for item 1, 48 for item 2, 2 for item 3, 49 for item 4, 3 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 751. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 255. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 255. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 483 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 255.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\

Round 2: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\

    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 100 for item 1, 84 for item 2, 90 for item 3, 88 for item 4, 94 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1964. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 190. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 190. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1368 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 190.\

================================================================================\
Game 85, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 100 for item 1, 84 for item 2, 90 for item 3, 88 for item 4, 94 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1964. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 190. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 190. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1368 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 190.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [4, 1, 2, 0, 2]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 1, 2, 0, 2]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\

    - WALK to walk away\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 50 for item 1, 71 for item 2, 76 for item 3, 2 for item 4, 92 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 823. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 35. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 35. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 35.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 93 for item 1, 12 for item 2, 38 for item 3, 38 for item 4, 67 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 651. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 242. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 242. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 744 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 242.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

\
    3) Let's decide:\

    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Round 1 Values:\

================================================================================\
Game 86, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 50 for item 1, 71 for item 2, 76 for item 3, 2 for item 4, 92 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 823. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 35. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 35. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 35.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 3, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 3, 0, 0]\

Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 3, 0, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 81 for item 1, 31 for item 2, 72 for item 3, 36 for item 4, 52 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1295. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 984. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 984. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 816 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 984.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Game 88, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 33 for item 1, 90 for item 2, 11 for item 3, 11 for item 4, 18 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 365. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 307. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 307. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 489 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 307.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 17 for item 1, 73 for item 2, 79 for item 3, 23 for item 4, 14 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 653. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 206. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 206. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 618 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 206.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 693 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 97.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 90, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 59 for item 1, 40 for item 2, 20 for item 3, 11 for item 4, 74 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 818. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 26. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 26. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 612 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 26.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

Game 90, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 59 for item 1, 40 for item 2, 20 for item 3, 11 for item 4, 74 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 818. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 26. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 26. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 612 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 26.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 0, 2]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 4]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 0, 4]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 11 for item 1, 20 for item 2, 12 for item 3, 91 for item 4, 68 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 786. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 474. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 474. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 606 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 474.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 11 for item 1, 20 for item 2, 12 for item 3, 91 for item 4, 68 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 786. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 474. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 474. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 606 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 474.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\

    There are 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 100 for item 1, 13 for item 2, 89 for item 3, 93 for item 4, 60 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1273. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 565. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 565. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1065 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 565.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 52 for item 1, 79 for item 2, 39 for item 3, 3 for item 4, 54 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 923. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 283. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 283. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 283.\
\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    Your private values are 51 for item 1, 3 for item 2, 47 for item 3, 56 for item 4, 48 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 913. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 861. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 861. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 615 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 861.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 36 for item 1, 45 for item 2, 51 for item 3, 29 for item 4, 25 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 783. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 418. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 418. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 558 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 418.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 94, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 82 for item 1, 41 for item 2, 47 for item 3, 34 for item 4, 38 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 989. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 106. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 106. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 726 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 106.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \

    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 95, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 4 for item 1, 57 for item 2, 54 for item 3, 26 for item 4, 30 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 777. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 120. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 120. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 513 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 120.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 51 for item 1, 1 for item 2, 62 for item 3, 2 for item 4, 4 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 421. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 182. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 182. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 360 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 182.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\

Game 96, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 48 for item 1, 47 for item 2, 81 for item 3, 18 for item 4, 54 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 836. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 101. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 101. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 744 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 101.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 36 for item 1, 63 for item 2, 78 for item 3, 81 for item 4, 3 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1005. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 736. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 36 for item 1, 63 for item 2, 78 for item 3, 81 for item 4, 3 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1005. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 736. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 736. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 783 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 736.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

    Your private values are 58 for item 1, 89 for item 2, 40 for item 3, 61 for item 4, 94 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1613. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 597. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 597. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1026 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 597.\

Game 98, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 48 for item 1, 63 for item 2, 79 for item 3, 10 for item 4, 37 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 942. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 89. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 89. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 711 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 89.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 77 for item 1, 86 for item 2, 11 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 43 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 995. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 788. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 788. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 828 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 788.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\

Game 99, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 77 for item 1, 86 for item 2, 11 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 43 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 995. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 788. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 788. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 828 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 788.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 0, 3]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 3, 1, 3]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 3, 1, 3]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 81 for item 1, 42 for item 2, 62 for item 3, 83 for item 4, 99 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 2479. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 2137. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 2137. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1101 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 2137.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

        "content": "To solve this, let's break down the information step by step:\\n\\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\\n\\n1. **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 1042.\\n2. **Item Values**: \\n   - Item 1: 54\\n   - Item 2: 50\\n   - Item 3: 81\\n   - Item 4: 25\\n   - Item 5: 59\\n3. **Current Offer (Items to Me)**: [0, 5, 3, 5, 0]\\n4. **Round and Discount Factor**:\\n   - Current round: 1\\n   - Discount factor \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\): 0.9\\n\\n### Step 2: Calculate Values\\n\\n- **Discount Factor in Current Round**: For round 1, the discount factor is \\\\( \\\\gamma^\{0\} = 1 \\\\).\\n\\n#### Calculate Total Value if I Accept the Current Offer\\n\\n- 0 units of Item 1: \\\\( 0 \\\\times 54 = 0 \\\\)\\n- 5 units of Item 2: \\\\( 5 \\\\times 50 = 250 \\\\)\\n- 3 units of Item 3: \\\\( 3 \\\\times 81 = 243 \\\\)\\n- 5 units of Item 4: \\\\( 5 \\\\times 25 = 125 \\\\)\\n- 0 units of Item 5: \\\\( 0 \\\\times 59 = 0 \\\\)\\n\\nTotal Value if I Accept: \\\\( 0 + 250 + 243 + 125 + 0 = 618 \\\\)\\n\\n#### Compare to Outside Offer\\n\\n- My outside offer value is 1042, which is greater than 618. Thus, accepting the current offer provides less value than my outside offer.\\n\\n#### Potential Counteroffers\\n\\nTo make a counteroffer where my value is higher than 1042 after discounting, I would need an arrangement of items that substantially increases my value. I'll consider offering a division where I keep more of the high-value items:\\n\\nExample of possible counteroffer division:\\n\\n- Give away: [1, 2, 1, 5, 2] \\n  - Remaining for me: [4, 5, 5, 6, 3] \\n  \\nCalculate this example:\\n\\n- 4 units of Item 1: \\\\( 4 \\\\times 54 = 216 \\\\)\\n- 5 units of Item 2: \\\\( 5 \\\\times 50 = 250 \\\\)\\n- 5 units of Item 3: \\\\( 5 \\\\times 81 = 405 \\\\)\\n- 6 units of Item 4: \\\\( 6 \\\\times 25 = 150 \\\\)\\n- 3 units of Item 5: \\\\( 3 \\\\times 59 = 177 \\\\)\\n\\nTotal Value: \\\\( 216 + 250 + 405 + 150 + 177 = 1198 \\\\)\\n\\nAfter Discount (round 1): \\\\( 1198 \\\\times 1 = 1198 \\\\)\\n\\nSince 1198 is greater than 1042, this counteroffer has a higher value than the current offer and my outside offer. \\n\\n### Step 3: Decide\\n\\nThe current offer provides a lower value (618) compared to my outside offer (1042). A counteroffer dividing the items as above gives me a higher value than my outside offer. Therefore, I should make a counteroffer.\\n\\n```json\\n\{\\"action\\": \\"COUNTEROFFER\\", \\"offer\\": [1, 2, 1, 5, 2]\}\\n```",\

================================================================================\
Game 100, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 11 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 81 for item 1, 42 for item 2, 62 for item 3, 83 for item 4, 99 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 2479. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 2137. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 2137. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1101 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 2137.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
