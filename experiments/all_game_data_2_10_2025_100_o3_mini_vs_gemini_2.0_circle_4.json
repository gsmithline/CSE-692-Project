Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 207. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 207. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 462 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Delaying reduces the present value by a factor \u03b3^(r-1).\n\n2) Offer assessment:\n\u2003\u2022 A deal must at least give me a payoff above 207.\n\u2003\u2022 I wish to maximize my outcome by keeping as many high\u2010value items as possible (especially item2 and item5) while offering more of items I value less (items 3 and 4). \n\u2003\u2022 For example, if I propose giving Player 2:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 1 unit of item1 (leaving me 3, worth 3\u00d724 = 72),\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 0 units of item2 (keeping both, 2\u00d733 = 66),\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 2 units of item3 (leaving me with 1, 1\u00d78 = 8),\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 2 units of item4 (leaving me with 1, 1\u00d726 = 26),\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 0 units of item5 (keeping both, 2\u00d763 = 126),\n\u2003\u2003my total value becomes 72 + 66 + 8 + 26 + 126 = 298.\n\u2003\u2022 This outcome is well above the outside offer of 207 and avoids mistakes such as proposing a deal worse than my fallback or giving away too much/high\u2010value property.\n\n3) Decision:\n\u2003\u2022 I do not have a current offer on the table, so I make the initial offer as above.\n\u2003\u2022 This counteroffer gives me a high total value and, while it is somewhat demanding, it leaves sufficient \u201croom\u201d for further negotiation should Player 2 counter.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 2, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 481. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 831 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of Item 1.\n   - Value of accepting current offer: 1 * 84 = 84.\n   - This is much less than my outside offer value of 481.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to consider what I would keep if I made a counteroffer. Let's calculate the total value of all items to me:\n      - 5 * 84 + 3 * 52 + 2 * 95 + 5 * 29 + 0 * 17 = 420 + 156 + 190 + 145 + 0 = 911\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer (84) is worse than my outside offer (481).\n   - I should not walk away immediately, as there are two rounds remaining and I might be able to negotiate a better deal.\n   - I need to make a counteroffer that is better than 84 for Player 1, but also significantly improves my outcome compared to my outside offer.\n   - I could offer Player 1 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5, which means I will keep 2 units of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 4 units of Item 4, 0 units of Item 5\n\n   - Calculate the value to me if I offer Player 1 [3, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n      - I keep 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 84 = 168\n      - I keep 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 52 = 104\n      - I keep 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 95 = 190\n      - I keep 4 units of item 4 = 4 * 29 = 116\n      - I keep 0 units of item 5 = 0 * 17 = 0\n      - Total value to me = 168 + 104 + 190 + 116 + 0 = 578.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 481.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 84, item 2 = 52, item 3 = 95, item 4 = 29, item 5 = 17.\n   - Total pool of items: 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an agreement in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the items. An agreement in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value of the items.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I receive [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n     - Value of current offer: 1 * 84 + 0 * 52 + 0 * 95 + 0 * 29 + 0 * 17 = 84\n     - Discounted value of current offer: 84 * 0.9 = 75.6\n     - Since 75.6 < 481, accepting this offer would be worse than walking away with my outside offer.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to propose an offer that is better for me than my outside offer, considering the discount factor. I also need to consider what Player 1 might accept. Since Player 1 keeps offering me very little in item 1, I must assume he values item 1 highy\n\n   Let's calculate a good split that I like. If I take all of items 2, 3, 4 and 5, my total will be\n    3*52 + 2*95 + 5*29 + 0 = 156 + 190 + 145 = 491. If I take all of these items, I'd still need to take at least 1 unit of item 1 to match my outside offer, which will make my payoff 491 + 84 = 575.\n\n     For example, if I were to counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (give player 1 nothing), I'd keep:\n     5 units of item 1 = 5 * 84 = 420\n     3 units of item 2 = 3 * 52 = 156\n     2 units of item 3 = 2 * 95 = 190\n     5 units of item 4 = 5 * 29 = 145\n     0 units of item 5 = 0 * 17 = 0\n     Total value = 420 + 156 + 190 + 145 = 911\n     Discounted value = 911 * 0.9 = 819.9\n\nLet's try the split where I take only 1 unit of item 1. This means Player 1 has 4 units of item 1, and I take all other items. That makes it so I offer [4, 0, 2, 5, 0]\nValue of my proposed split: 84 + 156 + 190 + 145 + 0 = 575\nDiscounted value: 575*0.9 = 517.5. This is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is not acceptable.\n   - Walking away is an option, guaranteeing me 481.\n   - I will propose the counteroffer [4, 3, 2, 5, 0]. This gives Player 1 4 units of item 1 and nothing else. My payoff for this offer is 517.5. It is still possible that Player 1 might reject this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 3, 2, 5, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 3. My value for this offer is 1 * 53 = 53.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (53) is less than my outside offer (274). Accepting this offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 274. Let's consider some options.\n\n3) **Develop a counteroffer strategy:**\n\nSince Player 1 is only offering me one unit of item 3, I should counteroffer something that gives me more value while still leaving Player 1 with something. I need to keep in mind the discount factor. I should aim for an agreement in the first round if possible.\n\nLet's calculate the total value of all the items to me:\n(3 * 97) + (4 * 94) + (3 * 53) + (5 * 32) + (2 * 3) = 291 + 376 + 159 + 160 + 6 = 992\n\nIf I give Player 1 nothing, my value is 992. I need to give Player 1 enough value to make them accept, but not so much that my value falls below 274.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I give Player 1 one unit of item 1 and one unit of item 2. This would mean I keep 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nMy value would be:\n(2 * 97) + (3 * 94) + (3 * 53) + (5 * 32) + (2 * 3) = 194 + 282 + 159 + 160 + 6 = 801\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer. Therefore, it's safe to give some value to Player 1.\n\nCounteroffer: Give Player 1 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n4) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 274. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 837 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

The values for me are:\n        *   0 * 97 = 0\n        *   2 * 94 = 188\n        *   3 * 53 = 159\n        *   0 * 32 = 0\n        *   0 * 3 = 0\n        *   Total value = 0 + 188 + 159 + 0 + 0 = 347\n        *   Discounted value = 347 * 0.81 = 281.07\n    *   **Compare to outside offer:** The discounted value of accepting the current offer (281.07) is greater than my outside offer (274).\n    *   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since it's the last round, a counteroffer will be treated as a walk.\n\n3.  **Make a decision:**\n\n    *   The current offer's discounted value (281.07) is greater than my outside offer (274).\n    *   Since any counteroffer results in receiving my outside offer, accepting the current offer is better.\n\nTherefore, the best action is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [5, 3, 1, 3, 3]. This means I get 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. Let's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n    *   5 units of item 1: 5 * 5 = 25\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 43 = 129\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 93 = 93\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 99 = 297\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 23 = 69\n    *   Total value: 25 + 129 + 93 + 297 + 69 = 613\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 613, which is less than my outside offer of 828. Therefore, accepting this offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few examples to get a sense of how to formulate a good counteroffer.  First, figure out the maximum possible value. I have 7 units of item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 7 of item 4, and 5 of item 5. My value is (7 * 5) + (4 * 43) + (3 * 93) + (7 * 99) + (5 * 23) = 35 + 172 + 279 + 693 + 115 = 1294.\n\n    *   I want at least 828 in value to beat my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer (613) is less than my outside offer (828), I should not accept. I could walk away now and guarantee my outside offer of 828. However, it's only round 1, so I'll try a counteroffer.\n\nHere is one potentially good starting counteroffer.  I will ask for almost all of Item 3 and Item 4.\n\n*   Offer Player 1: [7, 4, 0, 0, 5].  This means I receive items [0, 0, 3, 7, 0] for my benefit.\n    *   My benefit: (0 * 5) + (0 * 43) + (3 * 93) + (7 * 99) + (0 * 23) = 0 + 0 + 279 + 693 + 0 = 972.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1658. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 990 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since it is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. So I need to do better than 1330.\n\nSince the current offer is terrible, I will make a counteroffer. I'll aim to get at least half the value of the items. The total value of all items is (4 * 96) + (7 * 65) + (5 * 88) + (6 * 22) + (9 * 91) = 384 + 455 + 440 + 132 + 819 = 2230. Half of this is 1115.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 1330\n   - My item values: item 1 = 96, item 2 = 65, item 3 = 88, item 4 = 22, item 5 = 91\n   - Total item pool: 4 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 9 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value to me, and in round 3, it's worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My value for this offer is (0 * 96) + (0 * 65) + (0 * 88) + (0 * 22) + (1 * 91) = 91. Since it is round 2, the discounted value is 91 * 0.9 = 81.9. This is much less than my outside offer of 1330.\n\n3) Potential counteroffers and comparison to the outside offer:\nMy current holdings if I accept the offer are: 4 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 8 units of item 5. My value for this outcome is (4 * 96) + (7 * 65) + (5 * 88) + (6 * 22) + (8 * 91) = 384 + 455 + 440 + 132 + 728 = 2139.  The discounted value is 2139 * 0.9 = 1925.1\nMy outside offer is 1330.\n\nIn Round 1, I offered Player 1: [2, 3, 3, 4, 5]. If I got that deal, my items would be:\n2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\nMy value is (2 * 96) + (4 * 65) + (2 * 88) + (2 * 22) + (4 * 91) = 192 + 260 + 176 + 44 + 364 = 1036.\nDiscounted value is 1036 * 0.9 = 932.4\n\nLet's examine my previous offer:\nI offered [2, 3, 3, 4, 5] to Player 1. That means I would keep 2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\nThe value of that outcome is (2 * 96) + (4 * 65) + (2 * 88) + (2 * 22) + (4 * 91) = 192 + 260 + 176 + 44 + 364 = 1036\nThe discounted value would be 1036 * 0.9 = 932.4, which is below my outside offer.\n\nPlayer 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] in Round 1.\nMy items would be 4 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 8 of item 5.\nMy value would be (4 * 96) + (6 * 65) + (5 * 88) + (5 * 22) + (8 * 91) = 384 + 390 + 440 + 110 + 728 = 2052\nThe discounted value would be 2052 * 0.9 = 1846.8\n\nI will offer something between my initial offer and Player 1's initial offer to see if they will accept.\nCounteroffer: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3] to Player 1.\nThen, my items would be 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 6 of item 5.\nMy value would be (3 * 96) + (5 * 65) + (3 * 88) + (4 * 22) + (6 * 91) = 288 + 325 + 264 + 88 + 546 = 1511.\nThe discounted value is 1511 * 0.9 = 1359.9\n\nThis is higher than my outside offer.\n\n4) **Decision:**\nThe current offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] is worth 81.9 to me, which is far less than my outside offer of 1330. Therefore, I should not accept. I will make a counteroffer of [1, 2, 2, 2, 3] to Player 1 to see if they will accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

This means any negotiated deal\u2019s total value (calculated from my private values) will be multiplied by 0.81. Thus, even if I got all items (maximum value of 1998), the discounted value would be 1998\u00d70.81 \u2248 1618, which is still below my outside offer of 1658.\n\n2) Evaluating the current offer:\n\u2003- The current offer gives me [1,2,2,2,3] units.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item1: 1\u00d786 = 86\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item2: 2\u00d783 = 166\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item3: 2\u00d737 = 74\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item4: 2\u00d776 = 152\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item5: 3\u00d748 = 144\n\u2003\u2003Total value = 86+166+74+152+144 = 622.\n\u2003- After discounting at round 3, my value becomes 622\u00d70.81 \u2248 503.82.\n\u2003- This value is far less than my outside offer of 1658.\n\n3) Conclusion:\n\u2003- Since even an optimal allocation (getting everything) would yield at most 1618 discounted, no negotiated outcome in this round beats my outside offer of 1658.\n\u2003- Accepting the current offer (or even attempting a counteroffer) would risk receiving a deal which is inferior to my guaranteed fallback.\n\u2003- Therefore, I should WALK away to secure my outside offer.\n\nThus, my final action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This means I get:\n    *   Item 1: 3 units * 28 = 84\n    *   Item 2: 4 units * 10 = 40\n    *   Item 3: 3 units * 67 = 201\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit * 16 = 16\n    *   Item 5: 4 units * 36 = 144\n    *   Total value = 84 + 40 + 201 + 16 + 144 = 485\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (485) is less than my outside offer (759).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to calculate a counteroffer that gives me more than 759.\n\n3) **Decision-making:**\n\nThe current offer is not good enough as it is below my outside offer. Walking away would give me 759. Therefore, I should make a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, but I also need to make it somewhat appealing to Player 1 to avoid a walk-away on their end.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 only one unit of each item. This means I would keep:\n* Item 1: 4 units * 28 = 112\n* Item 2: 8 units * 10 = 80\n* Item 3: 4 units * 67 = 268\n* Item 4: 2 units * 16 = 32\n* Item 5: 4 units * 36 = 144\n* Total value = 112+80+268+32+144 = 636. This is still below my outside offer so not worthwhile.\n\nLet's offer [0,0,0,0,0] to Player 1, meaning I take all the items.\nMy value is 5*28 + 9*10 + 5*67 + 3*16 + 5*36 = 140 + 90 + 335 + 48 + 180 = 793\nThis exceeds my outside offer of 759, so I should make this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   Current offer to me: \\[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5.\n        *   My value if I accept: (0 * 94) + (0 * 77) + (0 * 94) + (1 * 64) + (0 * 68) = 64\n    *   Comparison to my outside offer: 64 < 460. Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n    *   Consider some potential counteroffers. A reasonable starting point might be to aim for a split that gives me at least my outside offer value.\n        * Since the current offer gives Player 1 one unit of Item 4, I'd want them to give back more value, or at least something that is closer to a 50/50 split, or at minimum something above 460.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   The current offer (64) is significantly less than my outside offer (460).\n    *   Accepting the current offer is a Mistake 4 (Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer).\n    *   Walking away might be too hasty in round 1, as there are two more rounds to negotiate.  Also, my discount factor is 0.9 so if I make a deal in round 2 or 3 it will be worth less.\n    *   I should make a counteroffer. To avoid Mistake 3 (Offering nothing or all items), I will propose a division that gives Player 1 something, but also gives me a good portion of the items.\n    * To maximize my value, I should keep items that I value highly, which are items 1, 2, and 3, and try to give Player 1 more of items 4 and 5.\n\n    Let's calculate a counteroffer:\n\n    *   I will offer Player 1: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 5 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5. This means I keep: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n        * My value: (3 * 94) + (3 * 77) + (2 * 94) + (5 * 64) + (0 * 68) = 282 + 231 + 188 + 320 + 0 = 1021.\n    *   This value of 1021 is significantly greater than my outside offer value of 460.\n\nTherefore, I will make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 5, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 43. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 441 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 90% of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 81% of a deal in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [2, 1, 3, 1, 0]. This means I keep:\n     - Item 1: 3 - 2 = 1 unit. Value: 1 * 36 = 36\n     - Item 2: 1 - 1 = 0 units. Value: 0 * 20 = 0\n     - Item 3: 5 - 3 = 2 units. Value: 2 * 1 = 2\n     - Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4 units. Value: 4 * 9 = 36\n     - Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1 unit. Value: 1 * 91 = 91\n     - Total value: 36 + 0 + 2 + 36 + 91 = 165\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 165, which is greater than my outside offer of 141.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to consider what a good counteroffer would look like. Since I value item 5 highly and Player 1 is offering me none of it, I need to get at least the item 5 for me. I also value item 1 rather high, so maybe keep at least one unit.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is better than my outside offer (165 > 141). Therefore, walking away or accepting a worse offer would be a mistake.\n   - However, I can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 only one unit of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5:\n  [1, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n\nThis means I keep:\n     - Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 unit. Value: 2 * 36 = 72\n     - Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1 units. Value: 1 * 20 = 20\n     - Item 3: 5 - 3 = 2 units. Value: 2 * 1 = 2\n     - Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4 units. Value: 4 * 9 = 36\n     - Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1 unit. Value: 1 * 91 = 91\n     - Total value: 72 + 20 + 2 + 36 + 91 = 221\nThis is better than current offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 3, 1, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 141\n*   My item values: item 1: 36, item 2: 20, item 3: 1, item 4: 9, item 5: 91\n*   Total items: item 1: 3, item 2: 1, item 3: 5, item 4: 5, item 5: 1\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 3, 1, 0]\n    *   My values from the offered items:\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 36 = 72\n        *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 20 = 20\n        *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 1 = 3\n        *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 9 = 9\n        *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 91 = 0\n        *   Total value: 72 + 20 + 3 + 9 + 0 = 104\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 104 * 0.9 = 93.6\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n    *   The discounted value of the current offer (93.6) is less than my outside offer (141).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   I need to keep in mind the items available: item 1: 3, item 2: 1, item 3: 5, item 4: 5, item 5: 1\n    *   If I propose a counteroffer, it will be my last chance. Therefore, any offer I propose should provide me with value greater than my outside option, as walking away after this is equivalent to accepting my outside option.\n\nLet's consider a possible counteroffer: I want to secure item 5 and a good amount of item 1, since they have the highest values for me. I could offer Player 1 all the items except one unit of item 5 and two of item 1. The offer to Player 1 would be [1, 1, 5, 5, 0]. This means I would retain [2 * 36] + [0 * 20] + [0 * 1] + [0 * 9] + [1 * 91] = 72 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 91 = 163. This is larger than my outside option, and discounted at 0.9 would be 146.7, still larger than my outside option. Since this is better than just walking away, it should be my counter offer if I'm not accepting the current offer.\n\nGiven that the discounted value of the current offer (93.6) is less than my outside offer (141), I should not accept it. I should propose the counteroffer above to try to secure a better deal before the final round.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the best course of action is to make a counteroffer that aims to secure a more favorable division of items.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 5, 5, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 8, 0, 2, 0].  This means I receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 21 = 0\n    *   8 units of item 2: 8 * 1 = 8\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 13 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 67 = 134\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 38 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 0 + 8 + 0 + 134 + 0 = 142.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (142) is better than my outside offer (93).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what items I value most and try to get more of those. Item 4 is my highest value item, followed by Item 5 and then Item 1.\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is better than my outside offer. However, it's only round 1, and I might be able to get a better deal. If I accept this, I am leaving value on the table. I need to consider possible counteroffers that would benefit me more.\nGiven my high value for item 4, and that Player 1 is offering me all of it, it suggests that Player 1 may not value it highly. It is not very risky to make a counter offer.\n\nLet's make a counteroffer that gives away item 2 which I don't value, but asks for some of item 1 which is also of middling value.\n\n**Counteroffer:** Offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThis means I keep:\n*   5 units of item 1: 5 * 21 = 105\n*   8 units of item 2: 8 * 1 = 8\n*   8 units of item 3: 8 * 13 = 104\n*   2 units of item 4: 2 * 67 = 134\n*   1 units of item 5: 1 * 38 = 38\nTotal value = 105 + 8 + 104 + 134 + 38 = 389\n\nThis is much better than the current offer and my outside option, so let's try it as a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

So accepting is better than walking away right now.\n\n3) **Consider a potential counteroffer:**\n   - Player 1 seems uninterested in item 2 and item 4 based on their offer, which is odd considering how much value item 4 brings to both of us. Let's see what happens if I propose to keep all of Item 4.\n   - Counteroffer: How can I calculate the offer I'll make?\n   - I am going to try to find a point where I give them just enough that they are indifferent between accepting and walking away.\n   - I think I'll make an offer where I give the other player 2 of item 1, 8 of item 3, and 1 of item 5. This means they get [2, 0, 8, 0, 1]. The total value of my offer is:\n      - (5 - 2) * 21 + (8 - 0) * 1 + (8 - 8) * 13 + (2-0) * 67 + (1-1) * 38\n      - = 3 * 21 + 8 * 1 + 0 * 13 + 2 * 67 + 0 * 38\n      - = 63 + 8 + 0 + 134 + 0\n      - = 205\n   - If I accept the current offer, I get a value of 127.8. I am going to try and offer [2, 0, 8, 0, 1].\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 127.8 to me, which is greater than my outside offer of 93. However, given that this is round 2 and player 1 has made the same offer as round 1, they might be easily swayed. I will offer a counteroffer where they get some item 1, item 3, and item 5, but nothing of item 2 and 4.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 8, 0, 1]}\n```",

This means I receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 67 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 94 = 94\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 84 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 89 = 89\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 84 = 84\n    *   **Total value of current offer:** 0 + 94 + 0 + 89 + 84 = 267\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 267 < 453. The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Consider possible counteroffers:**\n\nI need to keep at least a value of 453 for myself. This means that I need to find a division of items where my share is worth more than 453. Player 1 currently wants [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], meaning they would receive.\n* Item 1: 0 units\n* Item 2: 1 unit\n* Item 3: 1 unit\n* Item 4: 1 unit\n* Item 5: 2 units\n\nHere is a calculation of my current total value if I get to keep all the resources. \n* Item 1: 0 * 67 = 0\n* Item 2: 2 * 94 = 188\n* Item 3: 1 * 84 = 84\n* Item 4: 2 * 89 = 178\n* Item 5: 3 * 84 = 252\nMy total value = 0 + 188 + 84 + 178 + 252 = 702\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I want to make an offer that is good enough to avoid a walk, but also maximizes my payoff.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 116. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 825 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 453\n   - Item values: item 1: 67, item 2: 94, item 3: 84, item 4: 89, item 5: 84\n   - Total items: 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [0, 0, 0, 1, 3] (amount offered *to me*). This means I get:\n     - 0 * 67 (item 1) = 0\n     - 0 * 94 (item 2) = 0\n     - 0 * 84 (item 3) = 0\n     - 1 * 89 (item 4) = 89\n     - 3 * 84 (item 5) = 252\n     - Total value of current offer: 89 + 252 = 341.\n     - Discounted value: 341 * 0.9 = 306.9\n\n   - Compared to my outside offer: 306.9 < 453. Accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n\n   - Let's consider a possible counteroffer. I want to aim for a value higher than my outside offer. Since player 1 offered me [0, 0, 0, 1, 3], they are keeping:\n      - 0 of item 1\n      - 2 of item 2\n      - 1 of item 3\n      - 1 of item 4\n      - 0 of item 5\n      - Their value: 2 * value(item 2) + value(item 3) + value(item 4)\n\n      Let's aim for a more even split of items. I want a discounted value above 453, meaning I want at least 453/0.9 = 503.33 \"raw\" value.\n      My ideal offer would leave the other player with at least the value of their outside offer, which we do not know.\n      I want as much of items 2, 3, and 4 as possible since my values are 94, 84, 89 respectively. Item 5 is also valuable at 84.\n\n     Let's try giving the other player: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] (keeping [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]). My value would be:\n      - 1 * 94 (item 2) = 94\n      - 1 * 84 (item 3) = 84\n      - 2 * 89 (item 4) = 178\n      - 2 * 84 (item 5) = 168\n      - total: 524\n      - discounted: 524 * 0.9 = 471.6\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me a discounted value of 306.9, which is less than my outside offer of 453.  So I should not accept.\n\n   - Walking away guarantees me 453.\n\n   - The counteroffer [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] yields a discounted value of 471.6, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer [0, 1, 0, 0, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "My outside offer guarantees me a value of 217. I know my private per\u2010unit values are: item1 = 1, item2 = 14, item3 = 8, item4 = 33, and item5 = 43 (with item5 unavailable). The total available items are: 1, 4, 3, and 8 of items 1\u20134 respectively (total potential value 345 if I got everything). Since this is round 1 the discount factor (\u03b3 = 0.9) means no discounting (\u03b3^(0)=1).\n\nA good strategy is to make a counteroffer that gives me at least as much as my outside offer. In fact, if I \u201csplit the surplus\u201d between my disagreement value and the maximum I could get, I would try to keep 345 \u2013 concession \u2265 217. That means I can afford to give away up to 345 \u2013 217 = 128 (in my own value terms). To aim for a mutually acceptable \u201cfair\u201d division I can consider splitting the surplus equally (128/2 = 64 each). This would let me retain a value of 217 + 64 = 281.\n\nI then determine a counteroffer that gives the opponent items with my value totaling 64:\n\u2022 For item1 (value 1/unit): giving away 1 unit yields 1.\n\u2022 For item2 (value 14/unit): giving away 1 unit adds 14 (cumulative 15).\n\u2022 For item3 (value 8/unit): giving away 2 units adds 16 (cumulative 31).\n\u2022 For item4 (value 33/unit): giving away 1 unit adds 33 (cumulative 64 exactly).\n\nThus my counteroffer is to give the opponent: [1, 1, 2, 1, 0]. My share becomes:\n\u2022 Item1: 1\u20131 = 0\n\u2022 Item2: 4\u20131 = 3 \u2192 3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n\u2022 Item3: 3\u20132 = 1 \u2192 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n\u2022 Item4: 8\u20131 = 7 \u2192 7 \u00d7 33 = 231\nThe total for me: 42 + 8 + 231 = 281, which is above my outside offer.\n\nThis proposal avoids the mistakes of giving away too much or too little while ensuring my outcome is better than my fallback.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 809.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 34, item 2 = 65, item 3 = 33, item 4 = 72, item 5 = 39.\n*   The total pool of items is: item 1 = 1, item 2 = 4, item 3 = 3, item 4 = 8, item 5 = 0.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. Accepting an offer in round 1 gives the full value. Accepting in round 2 multiplies by 0.9, and in round 3 by 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer to me is [1, 1, 2, 1, 0]. This means I receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   0 units of item 5\n\n    My total value for this offer is: (1 * 34) + (1 * 65) + (2 * 33) + (1 * 72) + (0 * 39) = 34 + 65 + 66 + 72 + 0 = 237. This is much less than my outside offer of 809.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find a counteroffer that is better than 809 for me. I have:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   4 units of item 2\n    *   3 units of item 3\n    *   8 units of item 4\n    *   0 units of item 5\n\n    Let's calculate the total value of all items to me: (1 * 34) + (4 * 65) + (3 * 33) + (8 * 72) + (0 * 39) = 34 + 260 + 99 + 576 + 0 = 969.\n\n    I need to keep enough items to be worth more than 809.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is worth 237, which is much less than my outside offer of 809.\n*   Walking away gives me 809.\n*   I need to consider a counteroffer that gives me more than 809.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that leaves me slightly better than my outside option while giving Player 1 a reasonable amount.\nHere's one potential strategy. Since item 4 is most valuable to me, I'll try to keep most of those. Item 2 is second.\n\nCounteroffer: Offer Player 1 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 0 of item 5\n\nThis would leave me with:\n* 0 of item 1 = 0\n* 2 of item 2 = 130\n* 2 of item 3 = 66\n* 6 of item 4 = 432\n* 0 of item 5 = 0\n\nTotal value: 0 + 130 + 66 + 432 + 0 = 628. This is less than my outside offer.\n\nSince my total value is 969 and my outside offer is 809, I need to keep more than 809/34/65/33/72 = around 83.35% of total items.\nLet's try to offer fewer items, but I need to consider offering more valued items to Player 1 to make the deal acceptable.\n\nCounteroffer: Offer Player 1: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0].\n\nThis gives me:\n* 1 of item 1 = 34\n* 3 of item 2 = 195\n* 3 of item 3 = 99\n* 7 of item 4 = 504\n* 0 of item 5 = 0\n\nTotal value = 34 + 195 + 99 + 504 = 832. This is more than my outside offer.\n\nSo, my best course of action is to make the counteroffer [0, 1, 0, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 809\n*   Item values: Item 1 = 34, Item 2 = 65, Item 3 = 33, Item 4 = 72, Item 5 = 39\n*   Total items: Item 1 = 1, Item 2 = 4, Item 3 = 3, Item 4 = 8, Item 5 = 0\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 1, 3, 0, 0]. This means Player 1 gets: Item 1 = 1-1 = 0, Item 2 = 4-1 = 3, Item 3 = 3-3 = 0, Item 4 = 8-0 = 8, Item 5 = 0-0 = 0\n    *   My values from current offer: (1 * 34) + (1 * 65) + (3 * 33) + (0 * 72) + (0 * 39) = 34 + 65 + 99 + 0 + 0 = 198\n    *   Since this is round 2, the value is discounted by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. So the present value is 198 * 0.9 = 178.2\n    *   This is far worse than my outside offer of 809.\n\n*   **Previous round offer (made by me):** [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n    *   If Player 1 accepted this, I would have had: Item 1 = 1-0 = 1, Item 2 = 4-1 = 3, Item 3 = 3-0 = 3, Item 4 = 8-1 = 7, Item 5 = 0-0 = 0\n    *   My values from this: (1 * 34) + (3 * 65) + (3 * 33) + (7 * 72) + (0 * 39) = 34 + 195 + 99 + 504 + 0 = 832\n    *   Since this was in round 1, the value is discounted by 0.9^(1-1) = 1. So the present value is 832 * 1 = 832\n    *   This offer is better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Previous round offer (made by player 1):** [1, 1, 2, 1, 0]\n    *   If I accepted this, I would have had: Item 1 = 1-1 = 0, Item 2 = 4-1 = 3, Item 3 = 3-2 = 1, Item 4 = 8-1 = 7, Item 5 = 0-0 = 0\n    *   My values from this: (0 * 34) + (3 * 65) + (1 * 33) + (7 * 72) + (0 * 39) = 0 + 195 + 33 + 504 + 0 = 732\n    *   Since this was in round 1, the value is discounted by 0.9^(1-1) = 1. So the present value is 732 * 1 = 732\n    *   This offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Possible Counteroffers:** I need to make a counteroffer that is beneficial to me and potentially acceptable to Player 1. I want to aim for something close to what I offered in round 1, but maybe adjust it slightly.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]. This leaves me with: Item 1 = 1, Item 2 = 4, Item 3 = 3, Item 4 = 4, Item 5 = 0.\n    *   My value: (1 * 34) + (4 * 65) + (3 * 33) + (4 * 72) + (0 * 39) = 34 + 260 + 99 + 288 + 0 = 681\n    *   Discounted value: 681 * 0.9 = 612.9. This is worse than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]. This leaves me with: Item 1 = 1, Item 2 = 4, Item 3 = 3, Item 4 = 5, Item 5 = 0.\n    *   My value: (1 * 34) + (4 * 65) + (3 * 33) + (5 * 72) + (0 * 39) = 34 + 260 + 99 + 360 + 0 = 753\n    *   Discounted value: 753 * 0.9 = 677.7. Still worse than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's offer [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] again.\n    *   My value: (1 * 34) + (3 * 65) + (3 * 33) + (7 * 72) + (0 * 39) = 34 + 195 + 99 + 504 + 0 = 832\n    *   Discounted value: 832 * 0.9 = 748.8. Still worse than my outside offer.\n\n    I need to get at least 809 / 0.9 = 898.89 value after items are valued.\n\n    What if I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then I keep everything.\n        My value: (1 * 34) + (4 * 65) + (3 * 33) + (8 * 72) + (0 * 39) = 34 + 260 + 99 + 576 + 0 = 969\n        Discounted value: 969 * 0.9 = 872.1. It is still worse than my outside offer! I need to keep everything and receive a value above 898.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer of [1, 1, 3, 0, 0] is terrible (178.2 < 809). I should not accept it (Mistake 4).\nMy previous offer [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] in round 1 was worth 832 to me.\nIf I make the same offer in round 2, its discounted value becomes 832*0.9 = 748.8.\n\nI should WALK if I can't get above the 809 value with the discounted offer in round 2. The only way to achieve this is to keep all of the items myself, which would be worth 969 * 0.9 = 872.1.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of the current offer and potential counteroffers:**\n\n    *   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 2, 0, 3, 4]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\n        My value for this offer:\n        (0 * 37) + (2 * 57) + (0 * 47) + (3 * 66) + (4 * 51) = 0 + 114 + 0 + 198 + 204 = 516\n\n    *   **Comparison to outside offer:** 516 < 880. Accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away and taking my outside offer. This would be Mistake 4.\n\n    *   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that give me a value greater than 880. Let's try to calculate a fair split.\n        The total value of all items is (4*37) + (9*57) + (4*47) + (3*66) + (4*51) = 148 + 513 + 188 + 198 + 204 = 1251.\n        A fair split would give me around 1251/2 = 625.5.\n        Because my outside option is high, I want more than a fair split.\n        I need to get at least 880 to avoid Mistake 2.\n\n3.  **Make a decision:**\n\n    The current offer is not good enough. I need to make a counteroffer that secures a better value for me. I want to ensure my offer is higher than my outside offer. Player 1 is only offering me 516, well below my outside offer of 880. Let's make a counteroffer which offers Player 1 a small share of the total value.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 unit of item 5.\n    This would give me:\n    Items for me: Item 1: 2, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 2\n    My Value: (2 * 37) + (5 * 57) + (2 * 47) + (2 * 66) + (2 * 51) = 74 + 285 + 94 + 132 + 102 = 687. That's way too low.\n\n    I need at least 880.\n\n    How about offering Player 1 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    This would give me:\n    Items for me: Item 1: 3, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 3\n    My Value: (3 * 37) + (6 * 57) + (3 * 47) + (3 * 66) + (3 * 51) = 111 + 342 + 141 + 198 + 153 = 945. This is better than my outside option.\n\n    Therefore, I will make the following counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 1, 0, 1]}\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 3, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 3, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 3, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 880.\n   - My item values are: item 1 = 37, item 2 = 57, item 3 = 47, item 4 = 66, item 5 = 51.\n   - Total item pool: 4 units of item 1, 9 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.  This means accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 1, 0, 3, 4].  This means I keep:\n      - Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n      - Item 2: 9 - 1 = 8 units\n      - Item 3: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n      - Item 4: 3 - 3 = 0 units\n      - Item 5: 4 - 4 = 0 units\n      My value for this offer: (4 * 37) + (8 * 57) + (4 * 47) + (0 * 66) + (0 * 51) = 148 + 456 + 188 + 0 + 0 = 792.\n      Adjusted for discount: 792 * 0.9 = 712.8\n\n   - **Consider previous round offers:** In round 1, I offered [1, 3, 1, 0, 1] to Player 1. This means I would have kept:\n        - Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n        - Item 2: 9 - 3 = 6 units\n        - Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n        - Item 4: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n        - Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n        My value for this offer: (3 * 37) + (6 * 57) + (3 * 47) + (3 * 66) + (3 * 51) = 111 + 342 + 141 + 198 + 153 = 945\n      Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 3, 4] in round 1. This means I would have received [0, 2, 0, 3, 4]. This means I keep:\n      - Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n      - Item 2: 9 - 2 = 7 units\n      - Item 3: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n      - Item 4: 3 - 3 = 0 units\n      - Item 5: 4 - 4 = 0 units\n      My value for this offer: (4 * 37) + (7 * 57) + (4 * 47) + (0 * 66) + (0 * 51) = 148 + 399 + 188 + 0 + 0 = 735.\n\n   - **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer (712.8) is less than my outside offer (880). The round 1 offers were 945 (my offer) and 735 (Player 1's offer).\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer (712.8) is less than my outside option of 880, I should not accept. I also need to think about a potential counteroffer. The previous offer I made would have given me a value of 945.\n\nI'm in round 2, so I need to think about an offer that would be valuable to me but also potentially acceptable to the other player. Given my values, I really want to keep Item 4.\nLet's try offering [0, 2, 0, 2, 2] to Player 1. That means I keep:\n      - Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n      - Item 2: 9 - 2 = 7 units\n      - Item 3: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n      - Item 4: 3 - 2 = 1 units\n      - Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n      My value for this offer: (4 * 37) + (7 * 57) + (4 * 47) + (1 * 66) + (2 * 51) = 148 + 399 + 188 + 66 + 102 = 903. Which is 812.7 with the discount.\n\nLet's try offering [0, 2, 0, 1, 2] to Player 1. That means I keep:\n      - Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n      - Item 2: 9 - 2 = 7 units\n      - Item 3: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n      - Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n      - Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n      My value for this offer: (4 * 37) + (7 * 57) + (4 * 47) + (2 * 66) + (2 * 51) = 148 + 399 + 188 + 132 + 102 = 969.  Which is 872.1 with the discount.\n\nI think I will offer [0, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

Since this is round 3, the discount factor will be 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer: (0 * 37) + (0 * 57) + (0 * 47) + (0 * 66) + (4 * 51) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 204 = 204\n    *   Discounted value: 204 * 0.81 = 165.24\n\n*   **Consider a possible counteroffer:** Let's consider a counteroffer that gives Player 1 1 unit of Item 1, 3 units of Item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 units of item 5.\n\n    I would then receive: 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this outcome: (3 * 37) + (6 * 57) + (3 * 47) + (3 * 66) + (3 * 51) = 111 + 342 + 141 + 198 + 153 = 945\n    *   Discounted value: 945 * 0.81 = 765.45\n\n    **Let's also consider the outcome of walking away:**\n\n    * Value of walking away = 880 * 0.81 = 712.8\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer has a discounted value of 165.24, which is significantly lower than my outside offer of 880 and the discounted outside offer value of 712.8. Accepting this would be Mistake 4.\n*   The calculated counteroffer has a discounted value of 765.45. While it's higher than the discounted walkaway value of 712.8, it is lower than my outside offer. Since this is the last round, if I offer this counteroffer, it will be counted as a walk away. Therefore, it's not better than walking away.\n\nGiven that the current offer is much worse than my outside offer and any potential counteroffer leads to the same outcome as walking away in the last round, I should walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 10. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 558 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 822\n   - My item values: item 1 = 87, item 2 = 27, item 3 = 68, item 4 = 50, item 5 = 28\n   - Total items: 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that deals in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I receive [0, 3, 0, 0, 5]. This means I get:\n        - 0 units of item 1\n        - 3 units of item 2\n        - 0 units of item 3\n        - 0 units of item 4\n        - 5 units of item 5\n\nValue of the current offer to me:\n(0 * 87) + (3 * 27) + (0 * 68) + (0 * 50) + (5 * 28) = 0 + 81 + 0 + 0 + 140 = 221\n\nSince 221 < 822, accepting this offer would be worse than walking away.\n\n- Potential counteroffers: I want to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 822. The total pool of items is:\n       - 6 of item 1\n       - 3 of item 2\n       - 5 of item 3\n       - 4 of item 4\n       - 5 of item 5\nThe current offer gives player 1: [0, 3, 0, 0, 5]. So I have currently assigned to myself: [6, 0, 5, 4, 0].\n\nLet's consider some possible divisions that would be more beneficial than my outside offer. I want to keep as much of item 1 and 3 as possible, while minimizing what I keep of item 2 and 5 as they are my least valuable items. Item 4 is in the middle. I need to give player 1 a better deal than the original offer, as well as an offer that is valuable to me given I may need to improve it in the coming rounds. I should also be mindful of the discount factor in subsequent rounds. I will try to find something that puts me around my outside offer value.\n\nIf I offer Player 1 [3, 0, 2, 2, 2], this means I get [3, 3, 3, 2, 3]. My value would then be: (3*87) + (3*27) + (3*68) + (2*50) + (3*28) = 261 + 81 + 204 + 100 + 84 = 730. This is less than 822, so I don't want to keep that allocation for myself. I will consider this offer as something I would give the other player.\n\nLet's try offering [2, 0, 1, 1, 1]. Then I would have [4, 3, 4, 3, 4]. The value would be: (4*87) + (3*27) + (4*68) + (3*50) + (4*28) = 348 + 81 + 272 + 150 + 112 = 963. This is higher than my outside offer of 822. I'll offer that.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer is terrible for me (221 < 822).\n   - I will propose a counteroffer that is greater than 822.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than an offer accepted in the current round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means Player 1 is offering me nothing. If I accept, I get 0 units of each item, resulting in a total value of 0.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would get from various counteroffers. The goal is to propose a split that gives me a value greater than 857. Let's calculate the total value of all the items to me:\n    *   4 units of item 1: 4 * 99 = 396\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 9 = 27\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 98 = 196\n    *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 26 = 104\n    *   8 units of item 5: 8 * 18 = 144\n    *   Total value = 396 + 27 + 196 + 104 + 144 = 867\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer (value 0) is far worse than my outside offer (value 857).\n*   Walking away would give me 857.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 857.\n*   Since the other player offered nothing I should probably demand more in this first round.\n\nI will start by offering Player 1 only a small portion of the items. I will offer Player 1: [1, 1, 0, 1, 2].

I will increase my offer until it is above my outside offer.\n\nLet's offer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] + [1, 1, 0, 1, 2] =  [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]\nMy kept items:\n*   3 units of item 1: 3 * 99 = 297\n*   2 units of item 2: 2 * 9 = 18\n*   2 units of item 3: 2 * 98 = 196\n*   3 units of item 4: 3 * 26 = 78\n*   6 units of item 5: 6 * 18 = 108\nTotal Value = 297 + 18 + 196 + 78 + 108 = 697.\n\nLet's reduce the items offered to increase my total value to above my outside offer of 857.\noffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \n\nMy kept items:\n*   4 units of item 1: 4 * 99 = 396\n*   3 units of item 2: 3 * 9 = 27\n*   2 units of item 3: 2 * 98 = 196\n*   4 units of item 4: 4 * 26 = 104\n*   8 units of item 5: 8 * 18 = 144\nTotal Value = 396 + 27 + 196 + 104 + 144 = 867.\n\nTherefore, the counteroffer is to give the other player nothing.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 757.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 89, item 2 = 1, item 3 = 58, item 4 = 38, item 5 = 30.\n*   The total pool of items is: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 6, item 3 = 4, item 4 = 5, item 5 = 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit, value = 1 * 89 = 89\n    *   Item 2: 2 units, value = 2 * 1 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit, value = 1 * 58 = 58\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit, value = 1 * 38 = 38\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit, value = 1 * 30 = 30\n    *   Total value = 89 + 2 + 58 + 38 + 30 = 217\n\n    Since 217 is much lower than my outside offer of 757, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to make a counteroffer that gives me more value than my outside offer. Let's consider giving Player 1 a relatively small amount.\n    *   Suppose I offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n        *   Item 1: 3 units, value = 3 * 89 = 267\n        *   Item 2: 5 units, value = 5 * 1 = 5\n        *   Item 3: 3 units, value = 3 * 58 = 174\n        *   Item 4: 4 units, value = 4 * 38 = 152\n        *   Item 5: 4 units, value = 4 * 30 = 120\n        *   Total value = 267 + 5 + 174 + 152 + 120 = 718. This is less than my outside offer.\n    *   Suppose I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This is not a valid offer (Mistake 3).\n\n    I need to offer them less to meet my outside offer threshold. Let's calculate how much the remaining items are worth after giving the other agent a fixed amount.\n\n    *   Suppose I offer Player 1 [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would receive:\n        *   Item 1: 3 units, value = 3 * 89 = 267\n        *   Item 2: 4 units, value = 4 * 1 = 4\n        *   Item 3: 4 units, value = 4 * 58 = 232\n        *   Item 4: 5 units, value = 5 * 38 = 190\n        *   Item 5: 5 units, value = 5 * 30 = 150\n        *   Total value = 267 + 4 + 232 + 190 + 150 = 843\n\n    843 > 757, so this is a valid counteroffer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable. My outside offer is 757. I will make a counteroffer to attempt to get a better deal than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means Player 1 gets:\n      - Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n      - Item 2: 6 - 1 = 5\n      - Item 3: 4 - 4 = 0\n      - Item 4: 5 - 5 = 0\n      - Item 5: 5 - 0 = 5\n      My value for this offer:\n      - 1 * 89 + 1 * 1 + 4 * 58 + 5 * 38 + 0 * 30 = 89 + 1 + 232 + 190 + 0 = 512\n      Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 512 * 0.9 = 460.8\n      - Alternative offer: [1, 2, 0, 0, 0] (what I previously offered to Player 1) This means I keep:\n      - Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n      - Item 2: 6 - 2 = 4\n      - Item 3: 4 - 0 = 4\n      - Item 4: 5 - 0 = 5\n      - Item 5: 5 - 0 = 5\n      My value for this offer:\n      - 3 * 89 + 4 * 1 + 4 * 58 + 5 * 38 + 5 * 30 = 267 + 4 + 232 + 190 + 150 = 843\n      Since this was offered in round 1, its discounted value now is 843 * 0.9 = 758.7\n\n      Since the discounted value of this offer (460.8) is less than my outside offer (757), accepting is a mistake.\n\n      - Potential counteroffer: I need to offer something that Player 1 might accept. Let's try to target a split that gives me at least my outside offer if it gets accepted in round 3, i.e. worth at least 757/0.81 = 934.57 to me,\n      So, if I keep:\n      - Item 1: 4 \n      - Item 2: 6 \n      - Item 3: 4\n      - Item 4: 5 \n      - Item 5: 5\n      My value is 934.\n      \n3) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n   - The discounted value of what I offered in round 1 is better than my outside offer.\n\n   To make a good counteroffer, I need to give Player 1 enough to make them accept while still exceeding my outside option.\n   I need to find a distribution, such that my value is greater than 757 and Player 1 accepts.\n   \n   Given the previous offers, Player 1 might value items 3 and 4 more. Let's increase the offer of items 3 and 4. Let's consider offering the other player: [1, 1, 2, 2, 0]. \n    - Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n    - Item 2: 6 - 1 = 5\n    - Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2\n    - Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n    - Item 5: 5 - 0 = 5\n    My value for this offer:\n    - 3 * 89 + 5 * 1 + 2 * 58 + 3 * 38 + 5 * 30 = 267 + 5 + 116 + 114 + 150 = 652\n    The discounted value is 652 * 0.9 = 586.8\n\n    Since that offer would give a discounted value less than my outside offer, I need to offer them less.\n\n    So let's consider offering [1, 2, 1, 1, 0] to player 1. \n    - Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n    - Item 2: 6 - 2 = 4\n    - Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3\n    - Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4\n    - Item 5: 5 - 0 = 5\n    My value for this offer:\n    - 3 * 89 + 4 * 1 + 3 * 58 + 4 * 38 + 5 * 30 = 267 + 4 + 174 + 152 + 150 = 747\n    The discounted value is 747 * 0.9 = 672.3, Still too low!\n\n    Let me try [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]\n    - Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n    - Item 2: 6 - 2 = 4\n    - Item 3: 4 - 0 = 4\n    - Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4\n    - Item 5: 5 - 0 = 5\n    My value for this offer:\n    - 3 * 89 + 4 * 1 + 4 * 58 + 4 * 38 + 5 * 30 = 267 + 4 + 232 + 152 + 150 = 805\n    The discounted value is 805 * 0.9 = 724.5, Still too low!\n\n    Let me try [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] to player 1\n    - Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4\n    - Item 2: 6 - 2 = 4\n    - Item 3: 4 - 0 = 4\n    - Item 4: 5 - 0 = 5\n    - Item 5: 5 - 0 = 5\n    My value for this offer:\n    - 4 * 89 + 4 * 1 + 4 * 58 + 5 * 38 + 5 * 30 = 356 + 4 + 232 + 190 + 150 = 932\n    The discounted value is 932 * 0.9 = 838.8, This offer is fine!\n\n    Therefore I will make a counter offer of [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] to player 1\n    \n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 48\n*   **My values of the items:** Item 1: 58, Item 2: 46, Item 3: 48, Item 4: 56, Item 5: 6\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer later is worth 0.9 times its value in the previous round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 1, 3, 1]. This means I get:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit * 58 = 58\n    *   Item 2: 2 units * 46 = 92\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit * 48 = 48\n    *   Item 4: 3 units * 56 = 168\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit * 6 = 6\n    *   Total value of current offer: 58 + 92 + 48 + 168 + 6 = 372\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (372) is significantly better than my outside offer (48).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  Let's consider some examples and their values to me:\n    *Keep all the items:\n        *Item 1: 3 * 58 = 174\n        *Item 2: 5 * 46 = 230\n        *Item 3: 3 * 48 = 144\n        *Item 4: 3 * 56 = 168\n        *Item 5: 3 * 6 = 18\n        *Total: 734\n    *Give Player 1 one of each item (minimum):\n        *Value is 372 (same as current offer)\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is much better than my outside offer. Therefore, walking away would be a mistake (Mistake 5).\n*   The current offer value is 372. If I can get a better offer in later rounds, after applying the discount factor, that would be ideal. However, there is no guarantee that I would receive one.\n*   Now, let's consider what a more reasonable split would look like. Since the total number of items is relatively low, a more 'fair' offer could be:\n\n    *   Item 1: Give Player 1 1, keep 2 for myself\n    *   Item 2: Give Player 1 2, keep 3 for myself\n    *   Item 3: Give Player 1 1, keep 2 for myself\n    *   Item 4: Give Player 1 1, keep 2 for myself\n    *   Item 5: Give Player 1 1, keep 2 for myself\n\n    This would translate into a counteroffer of [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]. What would this be worth to me?\n    *   Item 1: 2 * 58 = 116\n    *   Item 2: 3 * 46 = 138\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 48 = 96\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 56 = 112\n    *   Item 5: 2 * 6 = 12\n    *   Total: 474\n\nOffering the counteroffer [1,2,1,1,1] gives me a total of 474. With discount factor of 0.9, this gives 426.6 in round 2.\nOffering the counteroffer [1,2,1,1,1] gives me a total of 474. With discount factor of 0.9*0.9, this gives 383.94 in round 3.\n\nSince 372 is close to the maximum possible with discounts in play, the best move at this stage is to make a counteroffer to try to exploit a better position.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "My outside offer is 524 (a guaranteed payoff if I walk away). My private values for the items are: item 1 = 72, item 2 = 63, item 3 = 48, item 4 = 17, item 5 = 67. The total available items are 3, 5, 3, 3, 3 respectively. In any negotiated deal (which in round 2 is discounted once by gamma = 0.9), I must get a gross (undiscounted) value that is high enough so that after applying the discount (\u00d70.9) the payoff exceeds my outside offer. In other words, I want my share\u2019s gross value to be at least roughly 524 / 0.9 \u2248 583.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [1, 2, 1, 1, 1] to me.

After discount (330 \u00d7 0.9 = 297), this is far below my outside offer of 524. So accepting the current offer is not acceptable.\n\nI now consider a counteroffer. In a counteroffer I propose the split by offering some items to Player 2; I would get whatever is left. I want to design my counteroffer so that my kept bundle (total minus what I give away) has a gross value at least 583. I also want to \u201cpay\u201d items that I value less to maximize my advantage. Among my items, item 4 is the least valuable (17 per unit) and item 3 is also relatively low (48/unit). In contrast, items 1 and 5 (72 and 67 per unit) are high for me and I would like to keep them if possible. To entice Player 2 and not seem too stingy, I also set aside a small number of moderately valued items (like one unit of item 2 or item 5) for them.\n\nOne candidate counteroffer is to give Player 2 the following items:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 1: 0 units (I keep all 3 units)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 2: 1 unit (so I keep 5 \u2212 1 = 4 units)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 3: 2 units (I keep 3 \u2212 2 = 1 unit)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 4: 3 units (I give all 3 because I value them the least)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 5: 1 unit (keeping 3 \u2212 1 = 2 units)\nThen my remaining share is: [3, 4, 1, 0, 2].

After discount in round 2 (650 \u00d7 0.9 \u2248 585), my effective payoff exceeds my outside offer.\n\nSince this counteroffer gives me a strong position and does not commit any of the five costly mistakes, I will propose it.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 1]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 48\n*   My item values: Item 1: 58, Item 2: 46, Item 3: 48, Item 4: 56, Item 5: 6\n*   Total items: Item 1: 3, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 3\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal in round 3 will be worth 90% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 2, 3, 1]. This means they are giving me:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   3 units of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n\n    My value for this offer is: (0 * 58) + (1 * 46) + (2 * 48) + (3 * 56) + (1 * 6) = 0 + 46 + 96 + 168 + 6 = 316\n\n*   Since this is round 2, the value is discounted by a factor of 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. Therefore, the present value is 316 * 0.9 = 284.4.\n\n*   Since 284.4 is much larger than my outside offer of 48, accepting is much better than walking away *right now*.\n\n*   **Consider making a counteroffer:**\n    *   I need to decide if there's a better offer I could propose that Player 1 might accept, considering the discount factor and that this is round 2.\n    *   Player 1 offered me [0, 1, 2, 3, 1]. I offered Player 1 [1, 2, 1, 1, 1] in round 1. They responded with [0, 1, 2, 3, 1].\n    * I have 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n\n    Let's consider how much of each item *I* would keep.\n    If I take [0, 1, 2, 3, 1], that leaves me with:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 2 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 3 = 0\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n     \n    My value if I keep this is: (3 * 58) + (4 * 46) + (1 * 48) + (0 * 56) + (2 * 6) = 174 + 184 + 48 + 0 + 12 = 418\n  \n    Let's figure out the allocation in my round 1 offer. I offered Player 1 [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]. That meant I was keeping\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n\n    My value if I keep this is: (2 * 58) + (3 * 46) + (2 * 48) + (2 * 56) + (2 * 6) = 116 + 138 + 96 + 112 + 12 = 474\n\n    Because this is round 2, 474*.9 = 426.6. \n    Since 426.6 > 284.4, I should probably try to get closer to my earlier offer.\n    Note: This is round 2. If I don't come to an agreement, I will have my outside offer discounted by 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 284.4 to me. That's much greater than my outside offer. Since it seems like Player 1 is trying to squeeze as much value as possible, I am concerned if I offer too little, they will reject. Let's nudge them a little by offering them slightly less of the items I value most.\n\nI am going to counteroffer. I will offer them the following, offering slightly less of item 1, 2 and 3.\n[0, 1, 1, 3, 1]\nThis leaves me with:\n*   Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3\n*   Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4\n*   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n*   Item 4: 3 - 3 = 0\n*   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n\nValue is: 3 * 58 + 4 * 46 + 2 * 48 + 0 + 2 * 6 = 174 + 184 + 96 + 12 = 466. The discounted value is 466 * .9 = 419.4\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 3, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 112. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 537 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 932.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 65, item 2 = 59, item 3 = 67, item 4 = 26, item 5 = 94.\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 2, 2, 1]. This means I would receive:\n      - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 65 = 130\n      - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 59 = 59\n      - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 67 = 134\n      - 2 units of item 4: 2 * 26 = 52\n      - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 94 = 94\n      - Total value: 130 + 59 + 134 + 52 + 94 = 469\n   - Comparing this to my outside offer: 469 < 932.  So accepting this offer would be worse than walking away.\n   - Now, let's consider a potential counteroffer. I have to give *something* to Player 1.\n   - I have 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n   - I should not accept the current offer.\n   - I need to make a counteroffer that is at least as good as my outside offer *after* the discount factor. Let's consider what I would need to gain to make a counteroffer worthwhile. Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. Therefore, I need to get a value of at least 932.\n\nTo achieve this, I will offer player 1 the minimum I can while ensuring I meet my own objectives. This will likely maximize my gains in the end. Let's try offering Player 1:\n1 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 units of item 5.  Then I would receive:\n3 units of item 1: 3 * 65 = 195\n1 unit of item 2: 1 * 59 = 59\n3 unit of item 3: 3 * 67 = 201\n3 unit of item 4: 3 * 26 = 78\n2 unit of item 5: 2 * 94 = 188\nTotal Value: 195 + 59 + 201 + 78 + 188 = 721 which is not greater than 932. This is not a good offer\n\nWhat if I offer Player 1:\n0 units of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 0 units of item 5.  Then I would receive:\n4 units of item 1: 4 * 65 = 260\n2 unit of item 2: 2 * 59 = 118\n4 unit of item 3: 4 * 67 = 268\n4 unit of item 4: 4 * 26 = 104\n3 unit of item 5: 3 * 94 = 282\nTotal Value: 260 + 118 + 268 + 104 + 282 = 1032\n\nI will try to get close to my outside offer by offering as little as possible to player 1. I will offer player 1:\n1 units of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 units of item 5.  Then I would receive:\n3 units of item 1: 3 * 65 = 195\n2 unit of item 2: 2 * 59 = 118\n3 unit of item 3: 3 * 67 = 201\n3 unit of item 4: 3 * 26 = 78\n3 unit of item 5: 3 * 94 = 282\nTotal Value: 195 + 118 + 201 + 78 + 282 = 874 This is below my threshold so I need to take more for myself.\n\nI will make a more aggressive counteroffer to Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThen I receive 1032 which is greater than my offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 932.\n   - My item values are: item 1 = 65, item 2 = 59, item 3 = 67, item 4 = 26, item 5 = 94.\n   - The total item pool is: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. Since we are in round 2, any deal made now will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This means I receive:\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 65 = 65\n     - 0 units of item 2: 0 * 59 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 67 = 67\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 26 = 26\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 94 = 94\n     - Total value: 65 + 0 + 67 + 26 + 94 = 252\n     - Discounted value: 252 * 0.9 = 226.8\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's discounted value (226.8) is much lower than my outside offer (932).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to figure out a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept, and which is better than my outside offer (when discounted). Let's calculate the value of keeping everything:\n      - 4 units of item 1: 4 * 65 = 260\n      - 2 units of item 2: 2 * 59 = 118\n      - 4 units of item 3: 4 * 67 = 268\n      - 4 units of item 4: 4 * 26 = 104\n      - 3 units of item 5: 3 * 94 = 282\n      - Total Value: 260 + 118 + 268 + 104 + 282 = 1032\n      - Discounted Value: 1032 * 0.9 = 928.8. This is less than my outside offer, so I can't keep everything.\n\nLet's evaluate an offer where I offer Player 1 the minimum units necessary to make a deal better than my outside offer. This requires knowing Player 1's values, which I don't. Therefore, I will offer player one nearly everything so as not to be worse than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer (226.8) is significantly worse than my outside offer (932), I should not accept it. Also keeping everything is not better than my outside offer. It's round 2. I should make a counteroffer.\n\nI will make a counteroffer, offering Player 1 nearly all of the items so as not to be worse than my outside offer.\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 3, 3, 2]}\n",

Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   Now let's consider a potential counteroffer, aiming for a value higher than 434. I want to make it so I get most or all of items that I value more than Player 1. \n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 the following:\n*   Item 1: 0\n*   Item 2: 5\n*   Item 3: 0\n*   Item 4: 0\n*   Item 5: 0\nSo my counteroffer is [0, 5, 0, 0, 0].\nThis leaves me with:\n*   Item 1: 2\n*   Item 2: 0\n*   Item 3: 3\n*   Item 4: 5\n*   Item 5: 2\n\nMy value would be: (2 * 69) + (0 * 5) + (3 * 30) + (5 * 49) + (2 * 37) = 138 + 0 + 90 + 245 + 74 = 547. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer gives me a value of 400, which is less than my outside offer of 434, I should not accept. I should propose a counteroffer that is higher than 434. The counteroffer [0, 5, 0, 0, 0] gives me 547, which is greater than 434.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 434.\n   - My item values are: item 1 = 69, item 2 = 5, item 3 = 30, item 4 = 49, item 5 = 37.\n   - Total item pool: 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My value for this offer is (0 * 69) + (0 * 5) + (0 * 30) + (0 * 49) + (1 * 37) = 37.  Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 37 * 0.9 = 33.3.\n\n   - **Consider possible divisions and counteroffers:** I need to compare my outside offer (434) with what I could get by making a counteroffer. Since it's round 2, and it's my last turn to make a counteroffer (it will be treated as a walk if I do), the discounted value should be taken into account when considering potential counteroffers.\n\n   - **Let's calculate the total value of all items to me:**\n     (2 * 69) + (5 * 5) + (3 * 30) + (5 * 49) + (2 * 37) = 138 + 25 + 90 + 245 + 74 = 572\n\n   - **Possible Counteroffer Examples and Evaluation:** I want to find a counteroffer that, if accepted, gives me a value greater than 434 / 0.9 = 482.22 (the value I need to get to beat my outside offer after the round 2 discount).\n\n   - Here are a few possible scenarios to help illustrate:\n     * **Scenario 1: I offer almost everything:** I offer Player 1 almost everything, keeping only items worth 483 or more (before discount). This sounds unlikely to be possible.\n\n     * **Scenario 2: I offer a fair division:**  I could propose dividing the items so that we both get roughly half the total value.  Since the total value is 572, half would be 286. It means I can't offer half of the items because I need 482.22 to beat my outside option.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is worth only 33.3 to me, far below my outside offer of 434. Accepting is Mistake 4.\n   - Walking away guarantees me 434.\n   - I need to calculate a counteroffer that gives me more than 482.22 *after* I give Player 1 their share.\n\nLet's consider the original offer from Player 1 in round 1: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]. If I had accepted that, my value would have been (0*69 + 0*5 + 0*30 + 3*49 + 0*37) = 147. In round 2 with a 0.9 discount, the equivalent to that offer is only worth 132.3, so my outside offer is much better than that.\n\nLet's analyze the first counteroffer I made: offering [0, 5, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1. That means I keep everything else: 2 item 1, 0 item 2, 3 item 3, 5 item 4, 2 item 5. My value then would be (2 * 69) + (0 * 5) + (3 * 30) + (5 * 49) + (2 * 37) = 138 + 0 + 90 + 245 + 74 = 547. Since it is round 2, I will get 547 * 0.9 = 492.3, which is higher than my outside option 434.\n\nSo, I need to find a counteroffer that leaves me with a total value (before the discount) of at least 482.22/0.9 = 535.8.\n\nConsider giving the other player only item 2: [0,5,0,0,0] leaves me with 547\nConsider giving the other player only item 5: [0,0,0,0,2] leaves me with 498\nConsider giving the other player only item 4: [0,0,0,5,0] leaves me with 327\nConsider giving the other player only item 3: [0,0,3,0,0] leaves me with 482\n\nSince it is now round 2, if I were to offer Player 1 item 3 [0,0,3,0,0], this yields me 482 before discount and 433 after discount so that won't work. I need more than 482 before discount because of the 0.9 discount factor. I will make a counteroffer where I offer the items with the lowest values to player 1.\n\nI will offer [0, 5, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 544. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 678 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best action in round 2.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 544\n*   **My values for the items:** Item 1: 17, Item 2: 98, Item 3: 16, Item 4: 54, Item 5: 41\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its actual value, and in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its actual value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 0, 1, 2, 0]. This means I would get 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. The value to me is: (3 * 17) + (0 * 98) + (1 * 16) + (2 * 54) + (0 * 41) = 51 + 0 + 16 + 108 + 0 = 175. Adjusted for the round, this is 175 * 0.9 = 157.5.\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** 157.5 is less than my outside offer of 544. Accepting would be Mistake 4.\n*   **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to consider what I would get if Player 1 accepted my counteroffer. I need to get at least 544/0.9 = 604.44 value to make a counter offer worthwhile. Given my values, I could make an offer that would be accepted.\n\n    I currently have:\n    * Item 1: 2 units\n    * Item 2: 1 unit\n    * Item 3: 3 units\n    * Item 4: 3 units\n    * Item 5: 2 units\n\n    The value of these items is 2*17 + 1*98 + 3*16 + 3*54 + 2*41 = 34 + 98 + 48 + 162 + 82 = 424. I can't reach 604.44 in value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n*   The counteroffer on the table in round 1 [0,0,0,0,0] was also extremely low.\n*   Since the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 619. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 321\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 81, Item 2: 88, Item 3: 25, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 79\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 6, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 9, Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [3, 5, 2, 5, 0] (This is what *I* receive, Player 2)\n    *   Value of current offer: (3 * 81) + (5 * 88) + (2 * 25) + (5 * 5) + (0 * 79) = 243 + 440 + 50 + 25 + 0 = 758\n    *   Since 758 > 321, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *right now*.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider the extreme cases first. If I give player 1 almost everything, I would get almost nothing. This is not ideal since I would get much lower than 321.\n    *   **Counteroffer Example 1 (Greedy):** Offer player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything. My value is: (6*81) + (5*88) + (5*25) + (9*5) + (2*79) = 486 + 440 + 125 + 45 + 158 = 1254. While this is the maximum value I can get, it's extremely unlikely Player 1 will accept.\n    *   **Counteroffer Example 2 (Fair?):** Consider the total value of items. We need to leave player 1 with a decent chunk, otherwise, they would just walk.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer yields a value of 758, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 321.\n*   I need to consider that if I reject this, I can make a counteroffer, which may be better, or may lead to a walk later on where I get 321.\n*   The discount factor isn't high enough to justify a very risky counteroffer. The current offer is a decent deal, but I might be able to get a little more.\n*   Let's try a counteroffer that gives me slightly more. If I give Player 1 [3, 4, 2, 5, 0] then I have [3, 1, 3, 4, 2]\n    * Value of Counteroffer: (3*81) + (1*88) + (3*25) + (4*5) + (2*79) = 243 + 88 + 75 + 20 + 158 = 584. It is still greater than 321, but now it has decreased in value. Since it is still above my walk away value, it is an option. But it does not give me more than the current offer. So lets not do that!\n\nGiven the high value of the current offer and the risk of losing out on a good deal, I will accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 376. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 570 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means I receive 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  My value for this offer is (1 * 24) + (0 * 54) + (0 * 47) + (0 * 27) + (0 * 38) = 24.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (24) is significantly less than my outside offer (376).\n\n*   **Possible Counteroffers:** I want to determine a counteroffer that maximizes my value while considering the discount factor and the possibility of Player 1 walking away.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer (24) is much worse than my outside offer (376), I should not accept it.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep the majority of the items, but give Player 1 enough to potentially accept. It's round 1, so I want to aim for a beneficial split for me since I have time and the discount factor isn't heavily impacting me yet.\n\nI will construct an offer and ensure I don't commit any mistakes:\n* Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. (N/A - this is the first offer I am making)\n* Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. I need to make sure I retain enough value to be above 376.\n* Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. I will not offer no or all items.\n* Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   0 units of item 2\n    *   0 units of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n    My value for this offer would be: (1 * 24) + (0 * 54) + (0 * 47) + (1 * 27) + (1 * 38) = 24 + 0 + 0 + 27 + 38 = 89\n    Since it's round 2, we need to apply the discount factor: 89 * (0.9^(2-1)) = 89 * 0.9 = 80.1\n*   Comparing the current discounted offer (80.1) to my outside option (376), accepting the current offer is much worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I have the following items to allocate:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 7 units\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit\n\n    I need to consider what I would keep and what I would offer to Player 1. Given my relatively low valuation of item 4, I will offer all of it. I value Item 2 more than Player 1 does, so I'll also keep it.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** Offer Player 1 [1, 0, 3, 7, 1]. This leaves me with [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], which has a value of 1 * 54 = 54. Applying the discount factor 54 * 0.9 = 48.6. This is still very low compared to my outside offer.\n\nLet's try a different approach. I need at least 376 / 0.9 = 417.77 value for me. Since my total value is 446, it's almost impossible to get this high of a value in round 2, as it doesn't leave much for Player 1.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer (80.1) and any reasonable counteroffer are far below my outside offer (376), walking away is the best strategy.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This means:\n    *   0 units of item 1 = 0 * 54 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 45 = 45\n    *   1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 4 = 4\n    *   0 units of item 4 = 0 * 73 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 61 = 61\n    *   Total value = 0 + 45 + 4 + 0 + 61 = 110\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 110 < 444.

                    "response": "My reasoning is as follows:\n1. My outside offer guarantees a payoff of 592. Any deal I accept must yield me more than this.\n2. My private values are as follows: item 1 = 43, item 2 = 83, item 3 = 86, item 4 = 68, and item 5 = 47. The full pool is 11, 2, 2, 4, and 5 units respectively so the total value (if I got everything) would be 1318.\n3. If I keep almost everything and concede very little to Player 2, my payoff from the deal would be 1318 minus the \u201ccost\u201d (in my value) of what I give away. For example, if I give away 1 unit of item 5 (with a cost of 47 to me), I would get 1318\u201347 = 1271 which is far above my reservation value of 592.\n4. Offering nothing is a known mistake (Mistake 3) so I must give Player 2 at least one unit of some item. By giving a single unit of item 5, I yield a minimal concession while keeping a high total value.\n5. Therefore, I propose an initial counteroffer where I give Player 2 1 unit of item 5 (and 0 units of the other items), ensuring that my share\u2019s value is 1271. This is well above my outside offer and does not fall to any of the listed negotiation mistakes.\n\nThus, my action in round 1 is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

This means that offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]. This means they keep 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\n    *   My value if I accept:\n        *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 53 = 0\n        *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 10 = 10\n        *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 33 = 66\n        *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 89 = 0\n        *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 92 = 0\n        *   Total value = 0 + 10 + 66 + 0 + 0 = 76\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value to me (76) is less than my outside offer (141). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a division that gives me more than 141. Since it is the first round, I want to make an offer that is favorable to me but not so extreme that Player 1 would simply walk away.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything:\n    * 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 53 = 53\n    * 3 unit of item 2: 3 * 10 = 30\n    * 5 unit of item 3: 5 * 33 = 165\n    * 0 unit of item 4: 0 * 89 = 0\n    * 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 92 = 92\n    * Total value = 53 + 30 + 165 + 0 + 92 = 340.\n\nI need to offer them something. How about offering them 1 unit of item 3?\nMy value would then be\n    * 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 53 = 53\n    * 3 unit of item 2: 3 * 10 = 30\n    * 4 unit of item 3: 4 * 33 = 132\n    * 0 unit of item 4: 0 * 89 = 0\n    * 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 92 = 92\n    * Total value = 53 + 30 + 132 + 0 + 92 = 307.\n\nLet's try offering player 1 one unit of item 5.\nMy value then becomes:\n    * 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 53 = 53\n    * 3 unit of item 2: 3 * 10 = 30\n    * 5 unit of item 3: 5 * 33 = 165\n    * 0 unit of item 4: 0 * 89 = 0\n    * 0 unit of item 5: 0 * 92 = 0\n    * Total value = 53 + 30 + 165 + 0 + 0 = 248\n\nThis is greater than 141.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable. Walking away would also be a mistake, as I can potentially get more. A reasonable counteroffer would be to offer Player 1 one unit of item 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the optimal action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1098.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1: 54, item 2: 2, item 3: 54, item 4: 76, item 5: 91.\n   - The total pool of items is: 1 unit of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 8 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth 90% of its value in the current round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 1, 4, 3]. This means I receive:\n      - 0 units of item 1.\n      - 1 unit of item 2.\n      - 1 unit of item 3.\n      - 4 units of item 4.\n      - 3 units of item 5.\n      My value for this offer is (0 * 54) + (1 * 2) + (1 * 54) + (4 * 76) + (3 * 91) = 0 + 2 + 54 + 304 + 273 = 633. This is less than my outside offer of 1098.\n   - **Consider a possible 'fair' split**: Since it is the first round, I can consider what a 'fair' split might look like.  A completely even split isn't possible due to the number of items. But let's aim for roughly half of each item for me. This would mean I keep about: 0.5 of item 1, 3.5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 4 of item 5. Let's calculate the value of this (rounded to the nearest whole number for simplicity in offering): 0.5*54 + 3.5*2 + 3*54 + 2*76 + 4*91 = 27 + 7 + 162 + 152 + 364 = 712. So I would offer the other player the remainder.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 633, which is less than my outside offer of 1098.  Therefore, I should not accept.\n   - Walking away gives me 1098.\n   - I need to make a counteroffer that is better than 1098 for me. I should propose an offer that gives me a higher value than 1098. I will offer Player 1 slightly more than half, since it is round 1. Giving slightly more ensures it might get accepted. \n   - Let's offer [0.5, 3.5, 3, 2, 4] to me.  I will round this to me receiving: 0 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\n   - Therefore, the counter offer will be: item 1 = 1-0 = 1, item 2 = 7-3 = 4, item 3 = 6-3 = 3, item 4 = 4-2 = 2, item 5 = 8-4 = 4\n   - My counteroffer to player 1 is: [1, 4, 3, 2, 4]\n   - My value for the counteroffer is: (0 * 54) + (3 * 2) + (3 * 54) + (2 * 76) + (4 * 91) = 0 + 6 + 162 + 152 + 364 = 684\n   - Given the discount factor of 0.9, I should aim to make at least (1098/0.9) value in a future round, which is 1220.\n   - Let's improve this counteroffer. To improve, let's get the maximum units of item 5 which has the highest value to me. Let me ask for: 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 0 of item 5.\n   - My value in this case: 54 + 2*6 + 5*54 + 4*76 + 8*91 = 54 + 12 + 270 + 304 + 728 = 1368\n   - That means the counteroffer will be: 1, 6, 5, 4, 8\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 6, 5, 4, 8]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1047. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1029 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth 90% of what it would be worth this round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I am offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 of each item. Therefore, Player 1 gets everything. My value if I accept this is:\n      - (4 * 100) + (5 * 54) + (4 * 91) + (7 * 59) + (6 * 39) = 400 + 270 + 364 + 413 + 234 = 1681\n      My value = 0. \n      0 < 1047, so accepting is worse than my outside offer.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to consider counteroffers that give me a value greater than 1047.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is a mistake (Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away gives me 1047.\n   - I should make a counteroffer that is better than walking away, meaning I keep items worth more than 1047.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I ask for half of each item rounded down:\n- I offer Player 1: [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]\n- I keep: [2, 3, 2, 4, 3]\nMy Value = (2 * 100) + (3 * 54) + (2 * 91) + (4 * 59) + (3 * 39) = 200 + 162 + 182 + 236 + 117 = 897\n\nThis is worse than my outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 5, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 641\n*   My values for items: item 1 = 70, item 2 = 52, item 3 = 43, item 4 = 5, item 5 = 25\n*   Total items: 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 5, 1, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value if I accept: (0 \\* 70) + (5 \\* 52) + (1 \\* 43) + (0 \\* 5) + (0 \\* 25) = 0 + 260 + 43 + 0 + 0 = 303.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (303) is less than my outside offer (641).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what a good counteroffer might be. Since Player 1 gave me all 5 units of item 2 and 1 unit of item 3, and the offer is significantly below my outside offer, I should consider constructing a counteroffer that gets me more value. I should consider which items Player 1 may value less than me.\n\nLet's see what my total value is, if I keep everything: (5 * 70) + (5 * 52) + (5 * 43) + (3 * 5) + (2 * 25) = 350 + 260 + 215 + 15 + 50 = 890.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer (303) is worse than my outside offer (641). So, I should not ACCEPT.\n*   Walking away would give me 641.\n*   I should make a counteroffer that gives me more value than the current offer and hopefully more than my outside offer.\n\nNow I will consider potential counteroffers, keeping in mind I have to give something to Player 1:\n\nI will propose giving Player 1 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 4 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nThis means I keep 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5.\n\nThe value of this for me is: (2*70) + (5*52) + (1*43) + (0*5) + (0*25) = 140 + 260 + 43 + 0 + 0 = 443.\n\nIf I instead keep everything except for one unit of item 1:\nI give player 1: [1,0,0,0,0]\nMy value is (4*70) + (5*52) + (5*43) + (3*5) + (2*25) = 280 + 260 + 215 + 15 + 50 = 820\n\nIf I instead keep everything except for two units of item 1:\nI give player 1: [2,0,0,0,0]\nMy value is (3*70) + (5*52) + (5*43) + (3*5) + (2*25) = 210 + 260 + 215 + 15 + 50 = 750\n\nIf I instead keep everything except for three units of item 1:\nI give player 1: [3,0,0,0,0]\nMy value is (2*70) + (5*52) + (5*43) + (3*5) + (2*25) = 140 + 260 + 215 + 15 + 50 = 680\n\nIf I instead keep everything except for four units of item 1:\nI give player 1: [4,0,0,0,0]\nMy value is (1*70) + (5*52) + (5*43) + (3*5) + (2*25) = 70 + 260 + 215 + 15 + 50 = 610. This is less than my outside offer\n\nIf I instead keep everything except for five units of item 1:\nI give player 1: [5,0,0,0,0]\nMy value is (0*70) + (5*52) + (5*43) + (3*5) + (2*25) = 0 + 260 + 215 + 15 + 50 = 540. This is less than my outside offer\n\nIt looks like giving 3 units of item 1 is a good starting point to try for a better outcome than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 228\n*   My item values: Item 1: 86, Item 2: 33, Item 3: 99, Item 4: 97, Item 5: 45\n*   Total items: Item 1: 7, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 2\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in a later round is worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 3, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 86) + (3 * 33) + (0 * 99) + (0 * 97) + (0 * 45) = 86 + 99 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 185\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (185) is less than my outside offer (228).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to keep in mind my outside offer and the discount factor. If I reject this offer, I will make a counteroffer, and the value of any accepted offer in round 2 will be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n    *   If I offer Player 1 everything, I get nothing, worth 0, which is terrible. Mistake 3.\n    *   If I offer Player 1 nothing, I get everything: (7 * 86) + (6 * 33) + (2 * 99) + (2 * 97) + (2 * 45) = 602 + 198 + 198 + 194 + 90 = 1282. Offering Player 1 nothing might not be the best strategy early on (Mistake 3), but in this case, maybe it makes sense to ask for more than is currently being offered, keeping in mind the outside offer. I should consider offers that give me a value > 228.\n\n    Let's try to figure out how much I would offer Player 1 to be indifferent between walking away and accepting in the next round. I need to receive at least 228 / 0.9 = 253.33 to justify rejecting the current offer and making a counteroffer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of 185 is less than my outside offer of 228. Accepting it would be Mistake 4.\n*   Walking away guarantees me 228.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer. Since the current offer gives me 185, that means they are keeping 6 of Item 1, 3 of Item 2, 2 of Item 3, 2 of Item 4, and 2 of Item 5. A lot of the value to me comes from items 3 and 4.\n\nI will make a counteroffer that is slightly favorable to me.\n\nI'll offer Player 1: [2, 4, 1, 1, 1]\nThis means I keep: [5, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nMy value would be: (5 * 86) + (2 * 33) + (1 * 99) + (1 * 97) + (1 * 45) = 430 + 66 + 99 + 97 + 45 = 737\n\nThis is clearly better than my outside option. I am not making a counteroffer worse than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This means offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   *Current offer*: Player 1 is offering me [0, 6, 0, 2, 0].\n   This means I get:\n   - 7 units of item 1: 7 * 86 = 602\n   - 0 units of item 2: 0 * 33 = 0\n   - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 99 = 198\n   - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 97 = 0\n   - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 45 = 90\n   Total value of current offer: 602 + 0 + 198 + 0 + 90 = 890\n\n   *Consider the discount factor:* Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n   The present value of accepting the current offer is 890 * 0.9 = 801\n\n   *Previous round counteroffer value:* In the last round, I offered Player 1 [2, 4, 1, 1, 1], meaning I would have received [5, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n     - 5 units of item 1: 5 * 86 = 430\n     - 2 units of item 2: 2 * 33 = 66\n     - 1 units of item 3: 1 * 99 = 99\n     - 1 units of item 4: 1 * 97 = 97\n     - 1 units of item 5: 1 * 45 = 45\n     Total value of previous offer: 430 + 66 + 99 + 97 + 45 = 737\n     With discount: 737 * 0.9 = 663.3\n\n   *Compare to outside offer:* My outside offer is 228. The current offer (801) is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Possible Counteroffers:**\n    Since the current offer is quite favorable (801 >> 228), I don't need to be extremely greedy. I need to think if I can improve the deal a small amount, knowing that the third round is effectively the final round.\n    Since item 2 is low value for me (33) and player 1 took all of it, I suspect it's valuable for them. Items 3 and 4 are valuable to me and player 1 offered me zero.\n    Let's consider a slight tweak. If I offer [1, 5, 0, 1, 0], I would have [6, 1, 2, 1, 2]. The value of this is\n     - 6 units of item 1: 6 * 86 = 516\n     - 1 units of item 2: 1 * 33 = 33\n     - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 99 = 198\n     - 1 units of item 4: 1 * 97 = 97\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 45 = 90\n    The total value would be 516 + 33 + 198 + 97 + 90 = 934. With discount it would be 840.6\n    If I propose [1, 6, 0, 2, 0] this is the same as accepting since I get offered zero of items 3,4, and 5. I should avoid this Mistake #1.\n\n    Accepting now is worth 801. Trying to get only slightly greedy might be a mistake if I WALK by mistake.\n    It seems best to ACCEPT.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 323.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 67, item 2 = 51, item 3 = 51, item 4 = 9, item 5 = 16.\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means an offer in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1, and an offer in round 3 is worth 81% of its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 3, 0, 5, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n      - Value of current offer: (0 * 67) + (3 * 51) + (0 * 51) + (5 * 9) + (0 * 16) = 0 + 153 + 0 + 45 + 0 = 198.\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (198) is less than my outside offer (323).\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n       - I have 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n       - Player 1 is currently offering me all of item 2 and most of item 4.\n\n   Let's consider a counteroffer where I try to secure more valuable items for myself while giving the other player less valuable ones.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer (198 < 323). Therefore, I should not accept it.\n   - I should not walk away yet, as there are still two rounds of negotiation left.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer if I keep the items from that counteroffer.\n\n   A reasonable strategy is to keep most of item 1 and item 3 for myself since these items have the highest values to me. I will give Player 1 most of the remaining items. Let's try offering the other player: 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\n   - Value of this counteroffer TO ME (what I keep):\n     - I keep: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n     - (2 * 67) + (3 * 51) + (2 * 51) + (5 * 9) + (2 * 16) = 134 + 153 + 102 + 45 + 32 = 466.\n     - Since 466 > 323, this counteroffer is better for me than walking away.\n\n   - Value of counteroffer TO PLAYER 1 (what I offer them):\n     - 2 * 67 + 0 * 51 + 4 * 51 + 1 * 9 + 3 * 16 = 134 + 0 + 204 + 9 + 48 = 395. Player 1 must value what I am offering to them at more than 0 (their outside offer), so this offer makes sense to propose.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will make the following counteroffer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 4, 1, 3]}\n```",

This means that an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value, compared to the present value of accepting an offer in the current round. Since it is round 2, the value of the current offer will be multiplied by 0.9 if the offer is accepted in round 3\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n    - **Current Offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. The value of this offer is:\n        - 0 * 67 + 0 * 51 + 0 * 51 + 5 * 9 + 0 * 16 = 45. This is less than my outside option, 323.\n    - **My previous offer:** My previous offer to player 1 was [2, 0, 4, 1, 3]. This means I kept:\n        - Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n        - Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3\n        - Item 3: 6 - 4 = 2\n        - Item 4: 6 - 1 = 5\n        - Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2\n        - The value of my previous offer: 2 * 67 + 3 * 51 + 2 * 51 + 5 * 9 + 2 * 16 = 134 + 153 + 102 + 45 + 32 = 466\n    - A possible counter offer needs to be at least 323.

This leaves me with 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 3 of item 5. My value would be: 2 * 67 + 2 * 51 + 3 * 51 + 3 * 9 + 3 * 16 = 134 + 102 + 153 + 27 + 48 = 464. This is also better than my outside offer.\n\nCounteroffer 2: Offer Player 1 [1,0,2,2,1]. This leaves me with 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 4 of item 5. My value will be 3 * 67 + 3 * 51 + 4 * 51 + 4 * 9 + 4 * 16 = 201 + 153 + 204 + 36 + 64 = 658\n\nCounteroffer 3: Giving a lot to Player 1, making sure I exceed the outside option: [0,0,1,1,0]. This leaves me with 4,3,5,5,5. My value = 4*67 + 3*51 + 5*51 + 5*9 + 5*16 = 268 + 153 + 255 + 45 + 80 = 801\n\nSince the current offer is very bad, and I want to move the needle, and because the discount factor is going to lower the values in the next round, I will make a counteroffer that is good for me but that I think Player 1 might accept. I will also make sure it's better for me than my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 3, 2]}\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1108. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "My reasoning:\n1. Our outside offer value is 1108. Our total possible value (if we got all items) is 1766. In this round the discount factor is 1 so any deal we get is undiminished.\n2. Our private per\u2010unit values are highest for item 4 (73) and item 5 (70) and lower for items 2 (39) and 3 (41) (with item 1 at 44 in between). To stay above our fallback while keeping high\u2010value items, we want to reserve as many of the high\u2013value items as possible.\n3. We can give our opponent items that are lower in value for us so that our retained value remains well above 1108. For example, by giving away all 6 units of item 2 (costing us 6\u00d739 = 234 value) and part of item 1 and item 3, we lower our concession cost.\n4. One proposed division is to offer the opponent:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 1 (cost 44)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 6 units of item 2 (cost 234)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 3 units of item 3 (cost 123)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 4\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 5\n\u2003\u2003The total value we give up is 44 + 234 + 123 = 401. Our remaining share is then worth 1766 \u2013 401 = 1365, which is above our fallback of 1108.\n5. This offer avoids the key mistakes. We are not giving away so much that our payoff is below our outside option, nor are we offering nothing or all items, and since no previous offer exists, we aren\u2019t worsening any previous proposal.\n\nThus, my counteroffer as Player 1 is to offer [1, 6, 3, 0, 0] units to Player 2.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 6, 3, 0, 0]}",

This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 6, 3, 0, 0]. This means Player 1 gets:\n    *   Item 1: 8 - 1 = 7 units\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 6 = 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 8 - 0 = 8 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 0 = 5 units\n    My value for this offer is:\n    *   1 * 15 + 6 * 91 + 3 * 71 + 0 * 68 + 0 * 2 = 15 + 546 + 213 + 0 + 0 = 774\n\n*   This value (774) is significantly lower than my outside offer of 1341.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nI need to formulate a counteroffer that provides me with more value than my outside offer. I want to keep as much of item 2 and item 3 as possible.\n\n*Let's aim for at least my outside offer value, and ideally more, keeping in mind I have 8 units of item 1, 6 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 8 of item 4, and 5 of item 5.*\n*I will start by giving away most of item 1, 4 and 5 and keeping most of item 2 and 3*\nLet's calculate how much value a counteroffer of [7,0,0,7,4] would yield me\n\nItem 1: 1 * 15 = 15\nItem 2: 6 * 91 = 546\nItem 3: 6 * 71 = 426\nItem 4: 1 * 68 = 68\nItem 5: 1 * 2 = 2\nTotal: 15 + 546 + 426 + 68 + 2 = 1057.\nThis is still not great.\n\nLet's calculate how much value a counteroffer of [7,0,0,8,5] would yield me\n\nItem 1: 1 * 15 = 15\nItem 2: 6 * 91 = 546\nItem 3: 6 * 71 = 426\nItem 4: 0 * 68 = 0\nItem 5: 0 * 2 = 0\nTotal: 15 + 546 + 426 = 987.\nThis is not great.\n\nLet's consider this, I could make a counteroffer where I give away all of Item 1, all of item 4 and all of item 5, how much would Player 1 value this?\nGiven they offered me [1, 6, 3, 0, 0] in the first round, it is likely they value Item 2 far less than I do, and value Item 4 more than I do. So giving them all of item 4 and 5 may well entice them to take a deal. Giving them all of Item 1 is more likely to be acceptable.\n\nLet's give a counteroffer of [8,0,0,8,5]\nThis would yield me:\nItem 1: 0 * 15 = 0\nItem 2: 6 * 91 = 546\nItem 3: 6 * 71 = 426\nItem 4: 0 * 68 = 0\nItem 5: 0 * 2 = 0\nTotal: 546 + 426 = 972\n\nBased on this analysis, my outside offer is still higher.\n\nSince it's the first round, I will propose a counteroffer to see how Player 1 responds.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n        *   My value if I accept: (0 * 62) + (0 * 38) + (0 * 59) + (5 * 57) + (0 * 12) = 285\n    *   Counteroffers: I need to consider potential counteroffers and their values.\n    *   Comparison to outside offer: The current offer (285) is significantly less than my outside offer (494).\n\n3.  **Make a decision:**\n\n    *   Accept? No, the current offer is worth 285, which is less than my outside offer of 494. This would be Mistake 4.\n    *   Walk? Possibly, but let's consider a counteroffer first.\n    *   Counteroffer? Yes, I will make a counteroffer.\n\nNow, let's think about a reasonable counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I should try to get as much of the items I value highly as possible. Items 1, 3, and 4 have the highest values. Player 1 is offering all of item 4, which means they may not value it highly. I need to offer Player 1 enough value to make them accept, while still getting a good deal for myself. Let's try to offer them all of item 2 and half of item 5.\n\nMy counteroffer: I offer Player 1 [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]. This means I would keep [0, 0, 2, 5, 2].\nMy value: (0 * 62) + (0 * 38) + (2 * 59) + (5 * 57) + (2 * 12) = 0 + 0 + 118 + 285 + 24 = 427\n\n427 is still less than my outside offer. Let's offer to player 1 all of item 2 and all of item 5:\nMy counteroffer: I offer Player 1 [0, 3, 0, 0, 4]. This means I would keep [0, 0, 2, 5, 0].\nMy value: (0 * 62) + (0 * 38) + (2 * 59) + (5 * 57) + (0 * 12) = 0 + 0 + 118 + 285 + 0 = 403.\nStill worse than my outside offer.\n\nI need to offer them less. Let's try to offer them all item 2, and 1 unit of item 5:\nMy counteroffer: [0, 3, 0, 0, 1]\nI keep: [0, 0, 2, 5, 3]\nMy value: (0 * 62) + (0 * 38) + (2 * 59) + (5 * 57) + (3 * 12) = 0 + 0 + 118 + 285 + 36 = 439\nStill worse.\n\nLet's offer them 2 of item 2, and 1 unit of item 5:\nMy counteroffer: [0, 2, 0, 0, 1]\nI keep: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3]\nMy value: (0 * 62) + (1 * 38) + (2 * 59) + (5 * 57) + (3 * 12) = 0 + 38 + 118 + 285 + 36 = 477\nCloser.\n\nLet's offer them 1 of item 2, and 1 unit of item 5:\nMy counteroffer: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nI keep: [0, 2, 2, 5, 3]\nMy value: (0 * 62) + (2 * 38) + (2 * 59) + (5 * 57) + (3 * 12) = 0 + 76 + 118 + 285 + 36 = 515\n\n515 > 494, so this is a viable offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

This means that any deal made in round 3 is worth 90% of what it would be worth in round 2, and a deal in round 2 is worth 90% of what it would be worth in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] means I receive 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer: (0 * 62) + (0 * 38) + (0 * 59) + (1 * 57) + (0 * 12) = 57\n*   **Value of keeping all items:** (0 * 62) + (3 * 38) + (2 * 59) + (5 * 57) + (4 * 12) = 0 + 114 + 118 + 285 + 48 = 565\n\nNow consider some potential counteroffers. I want to aim for a deal that gives me more than 494, and gives player 1 enough that they won't walk.\n\nConsider offering Player 1: [0, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n\n*   Value to Player 2 (me): (0*62) + (2*38) + (1*59) + (2*57) + (2*12) = 0 + 76 + 59 + 114 + 24 = 273.\n*   This is clearly a bad offer for me, it is less than my outside option.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. I get 1 unit of item 4, which has a value to me of 57. This is much worse than my outside offer of 494.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that is slightly more generous to Player 1 than my last counteroffer, and more palatable to me.\nOffer to Player 1: [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]\nMy value = (0*62) + (2*38) + (1*59) + (3*57) + (3*12) = 0 + 76 + 59 + 171 + 36 = 342\nThis is also way less than my outside offer.\n\nI need to get at least 494 to beat my outside offer.\n\nLet's calculate the maximum I could offer player 1 and still exceed my outside offer. If I offer Player 1 0 units, the value to me is 565. If I offer 1 unit to the other player, and they value that unit at maximum 101, then that is at most a loss of 101. The problem is I don't know the other player's value.\n\nIf I accept the current offer, I will get a value of 57. This is less than my outside option of 494. Thus, accepting is a mistake. I could walk, but there is still one round left.\n\nLet's propose giving Player 1 0 units of items 1-3 and 0 units of item 5. Then the only item I am giving them is units of item 4. If I give them all 5, then the value to me is 0. If I give them 0, then the value to me is 565.\n\nSo let's try giving them 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\nThat is the offer [0, 1, 1, 1, 1].\nMy value is 0*62 + 2*38 + 1*59 + 4*57 + 3*12 = 0 + 76 + 59 + 228 + 36 = 399. Still less than the outside offer.\n\nThe value of accepting the current offer is 57. 57 * 0.9 = 51.3. Thus it is not better to wait than to accept.\n\nLet's try offering them a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]. The value to me is 57 * 3 = 171, which is still very low.\n\nThis round, I need to make an offer that is not worse than the previous one, is better than my outside offer, and is not offering no or all items.\nLet's just try a random value.\n[0, 1, 0, 2, 1]\nValue to me = 0*62 + 2*38 + 2*59 + 3*57 + 3*12 = 0 + 76 + 118 + 171 + 36 = 401.\nThis is better than my previous offers, but worse than my outside offer. But I have one more round to make an offer.\n\nI think I will offer [0, 1, 0, 2, 1].\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 2, 1]}\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 1210\n   - Values of the items: item 1 = 18, item 2 = 58, item 3 = 94, item 4 = 39, item 5 = 70\n   - Total pool of items: 6 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 8 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its face value. It's best to get as much value as possible now rather than later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means they offer me 1 unit of each item.\n      - My value for this offer: (1 * 18) + (1 * 58) + (1 * 94) + (1 * 39) + (1 * 70) = 18 + 58 + 94 + 39 + 70 = 279\n   - Comparing to my outside offer: 279 is significantly less than my outside offer of 1210.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I want to keep as much of the valuable items 3 and 5 as possible.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 a relatively small amount of items 1, 3, and 4, and nothing of 2 and 5. I would still need to ensure that my offer isn't worse than my outside offer, nor worse than my next expected offer if they reject my counteroffer.\nIf I gave Player 1 2 of item 1, 2 of item 3, and 1 of item 4, then my holdings would be 4 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\nMy value would be: (4 * 18) + (1 * 58) + (6 * 94) + (2 * 39) + (3 * 70) = 72 + 58 + 564 + 78 + 210 = 982. This is less than my outside offer, so it is not viable.\n\nLet's offer Player 1 one unit of each item except item 3, as item 3 has the highest value per unit for me.\nSo I offer [1,1,1,1,0].\nThe value of Player 1's offer to me is: (5 * 18) + (0 * 58) + (8 * 94) + (2 * 39) + (3 * 70) = 90 + 0 + 752 + 78 + 210 = 1130\nThis offer has a total value of 1130.\n\nIf I offer Player 1 [1,0,1,0,0], the value would be (5 * 18) + (1 * 58) + (7 * 94) + (3 * 39) + (3 * 70) = 90 + 58 + 658 + 117 + 210 = 1133. This is better than the last offer.\n\nLet's aim for a value that's slightly above my outside offer to give me some negotiation room in case Player 1 rejects my offer.\nI will give Player 1 [0,0,0,0,0] and keep the whole items for myself. My value is 1245.\nI should offer Player 1 [6,1,8,3,3] to keep nothing for myself. My value is 0.\nIf I offer [3, 0, 4, 1, 1], my items would be: 3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 2 of item 5, with a value of (3 * 18) + (1 * 58) + (4 * 94) + (2 * 39) + (2 * 70) = 54 + 58 + 376 + 78 + 140 = 706\n\nIf I offer player 1 [0, 0, 4, 0, 0] my value will be 18*6 + 58*1 + 94*4 + 39*3 + 70*3 = 1023\nThis means I should give Player 1 [0, 0, 4, 0, 0].\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer. I should make a counteroffer that's reasonable, but still gives me a value close to my maximum possible value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1210. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 837 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1210\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 18, Item 2: 58, Item 3: 94, Item 4: 39, Item 5: 70\n*   **Total item pool:** Item 1: 6, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 8, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]  This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\n    My value for this offer is:\n    (0 * 18) + (0 * 58) + (4 * 94) + (0 * 39) + (2 * 70) = 0 + 0 + 376 + 0 + 140 = 516\n\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 516 * 0.9 = 464.4.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 464.4 is much less than my outside offer of 1210.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to calculate the value of keeping items for myself and offering the rest to Player 1. I want to aim for something that gives me a value higher than 1210 (when discounted by 0.9 or 0.81, depending on when it's accepted). Since Player 1's prior offer was only giving away 1 unit of each item, they're probably aiming for higher values for themselves.\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 slightly more than last time, focusing on items I value less and they might value more. I will give player 1 [2, 1, 5, 1, 2]. This means I keep [4, 0, 3, 2, 1].\n    My value would then be (4 * 18) + (0 * 58) + (3 * 94) + (2 * 39) + (1 * 70) = 72 + 0 + 282 + 78 + 70 = 502. The discounted value is 502 * 0.9 = 451.8. This is not higher than my outside option so I need to aim for more.\n\n    Consider offering Player 1 [3, 1, 5, 2, 2] . This leaves me with [3, 0, 3, 1, 1].\n    My value would then be (3 * 18) + (0 * 58) + (3 * 94) + (1 * 39) + (1 * 70) = 54 + 0 + 282 + 39 + 70 = 445.  The discounted value is 445 * 0.9 = 400.5. This is not higher than my outside option so I need to aim for more.\n\n    I'm going to try to target a value significantly over my walkaway. Say 1500. This can accommodate negotiation later on if necessary. Since it is only round 2, I will offer a low amount.\n\n    Consider offering Player 1 [1, 0, 2, 0, 1] . This leaves me with [5, 1, 6, 3, 2].\n    My value would then be (5 * 18) + (1 * 58) + (6 * 94) + (3 * 39) + (2 * 70) = 90 + 58 + 564 + 117 + 140 = 969.  The discounted value is 969 * 0.9 = 872.1. This is still too low. I will target this same value for the next round.\n    Therefore I am going to offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My discounted value is 1245 * 0.9 = 1120.5. Still low.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of [0, 0, 4, 0, 2] is worth only 464.4 to me, which is much less than my outside offer of 1210. I should definitely not accept this.\nOffering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] leaves me with a value of 1120.5 which is less than 1210 so this will not work.\nOffering [1, 0, 2, 0, 1] leaves me with a value of 872.1, which is less than 1210 so this will not work.\n\nLet me try to offer the player [6, 0, 8, 3, 3], which means I keep [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].\nThis equals 58 * 0.9 = 52.2 which is way too low.\n\nLet me try to offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep [6, 1, 8, 3, 3].\nThis equals (6 * 18) + (1 * 58) + (8 * 94) + (3 * 39) + (3 * 70) = 108 + 58 + 752 + 117 + 210 = 1245.\nDiscounted at 0.9 equals 1120.5.\n\nI need to improve my position, given I only have one round left. I will try to accept player 1's previous offer to see if they will accept the current offer on the table.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]}\n```",

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round. For instance, an offer worth 100 in round 1 is worth 90 in round 2, and 81 in round 3.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me 1 unit of item 3.\n    *   Value of current offer to me: 1 * 37 = 37\n    *   Since 37 < 1642, accepting this offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what offers might be acceptable to Player 1 while still providing me with a value greater than my outside offer. Since I have 3 rounds, there is value in trying to negotiate a more beneficial deal rather than immediately walking away. Let's calculate the total value of all the items to me: (5 * 88) + (6 * 71) + (8 * 37) + (7 * 99) + (7 * 77) = 440 + 426 + 296 + 693 + 539 = 2394\n\n    I want to make an offer that gives Player 1 enough items to be better than their outside offer, while leaving me with items worth more than 1642.\n\n    Let's consider giving Player 1 some of the less valuable items (item 3) along with some item 1 and item 4. I need to leave myself with significant portions of item 1 and item 4.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. I should definitely not accept it. I should not WALK either. I need to make a counteroffer.\n\nI will make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 3, and 1 unit of item 4.\n\nThis leaves me with:\n4 units of item 1: 4 * 88 = 352\n6 units of item 2: 6 * 71 = 426\n6 units of item 3: 6 * 37 = 222\n6 units of item 4: 6 * 99 = 594\n7 units of item 5: 7 * 77 = 539\nTotal value to me: 352 + 426 + 222 + 594 + 539 = 2133\n\n2133 > 1642, so this is a better deal than my outside option.\n\nI'm offering Player 1: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]}\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 1642\n   - Item values: Item 1: 88, Item 2: 71, Item 3: 37, Item 4: 99, Item 5: 77\n   - Total items: Item 1: 5, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 8, Item 4: 7, Item 5: 7\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 6, 8, 0, 1]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 8 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n     My value for this offer is:\n     (0 * 88) + (6 * 71) + (8 * 37) + (0 * 99) + (1 * 77) = 0 + 426 + 296 + 0 + 77 = 799\n     Since it is round 2, the discounted value of this offer is 799 * (0.9^(2-1)) = 799 * 0.9 = 719.1\n     This value (719.1) is significantly less than my outside offer of 1642.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 1642 / 0.9 = 1824.44 to consider it worthwhile since this is round 2.\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   The current offer of [0, 6, 8, 0, 1] is terrible for me, as its value is only 719.1, far below my outside offer of 1642. Accepting it would be Mistake 4.\n    Since the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I must either WALK or make a COUNTEROFFER.\n\n    Let's consider a potential counteroffer. I will try to take the maximum possible items and give the minimum to the other player. The other player offered me [0, 6, 8, 0, 1]. I will try to get at least as much value as my outside offer (discounted).\n    My resources are: 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5\n    If I offer the other player: [5, 0, 0, 7, 7], it means I keep 0 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 8 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 0 of item 5. The value for me would be 0 + (6 * 71) + (8 * 37) + 0 + 0 = 426 + 296 = 722. Since it is round 2, this would be discounted to be: 722 * 0.9 = 649.8\n    I want to get a value for myself to be greater than 1824.44\n    The total value of all the items to me is 2394\n    If I propose giving Player 1 nothing ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]), I will have all the items with total value of 2394. Discounted to round 2, it is 2394 * 0.9 = 2154.6. This value is greater than the discounted outside offer 1824.44.\n    So let me offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] as a counteroffer\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 868.\n   - My values for items 1-5 are 5, 76, 45, 69, 90 respectively.\n   - The total pool of items is 5 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 7 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means an offer in round 2 is worth 90% of the value of the same offer in round 1, and an offer in round 3 is worth 81% of the value of the same offer in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I am offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 2. My value is (1 * 5) + (1 * 76) = 81. This is significantly lower than my outside offer of 868.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to calculate what I would keep and its value, compared to my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer (value 81) is much worse than walking away (value 868).\n   - I need to calculate a counteroffer that is better for me than my outside offer, considering the discount factor. Offering the other player nothing, or everything, is a generally suboptimal move. Let's try a counteroffer where I give them the remaining items. I have a total of 5 units of Item 1, 5 units of Item 2, 6 units of Item 3, 7 units of Item 4, and 2 units of Item 5. The current offer gives me 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 2, so I keep those units. That means I am giving the other player 4 units of Item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. In this scenario, I get 1 unit of Item 1 and 1 unit of Item 2 which is equivalent to 1 * 5 + 1 * 76 = 81. Since this is way less than my outside offer of 868, I'm not going to accept this.\n\nNow let's try to come up with a better counteroffer. I'm going to keep more of the valuable items for myself. Suppose I offer the other player 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\nThen I would have 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nThis would be worth 3 * 5 + 3 * 76 + 3 * 45 + 4 * 69 + 2 * 90 = 15 + 228 + 135 + 276 + 180 = 834.\nThis is still less than my outside offer, so I'll need to keep even more for myself.\nI need to make sure I get at least 868.\n\nIf I give the other player 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\nThen I would have 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nThis would be worth 4 * 5 + 4 * 76 + 4 * 45 + 4 * 69 + 2 * 90 = 20 + 304 + 180 + 276 + 180 = 960.\n\nI am going to make the counteroffer to give the other player 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 3, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 868\n*   My values for the items: item 1: 5, item 2: 76, item 3: 45, item 4: 69, item 5: 90\n*   Total pool of items: item 1: 5, item 2: 5, item 3: 6, item 4: 7, item 5: 2\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its value in round 1. An offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I get 1 unit of item 5. The value to me is 1 * 90 = 90.\n*   **Counteroffer Considerations:** I need to consider what I would get to keep if I make a counteroffer and if that would be better than walking away with my outside option. Let's consider my current offer of [1, 1, 2, 3, 0]. If player 1 accepts this, my payoff is:\n    (5-1) * 5 + (5-1) * 76 + (6-2) * 45 + (7-3) * 69 + (2-0) * 90 =\n    4 * 5 + 4 * 76 + 4 * 45 + 4 * 69 + 2 * 90 =\n    20 + 304 + 180 + 276 + 180 = 960.\n\nIf player 1 walks away from this offer, then both players get their outside offers.\n\nWe can also consider the offer that player 1 provided, [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. If I accept this my payoff is\n(5-1) * 5 + (5-1) * 76 + (6-0) * 45 + (7-0) * 69 + (2-0) * 90 = 20 + 304 + 270 + 483 + 180 = 1257.\n\nSince the current offer from player 1 of [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] is worth 90, it is much lower than my outside offer. The value is 90 < 868, and it's also worse than the prior accepted offers.\nSo I shouldn't accept. I should also not walk away because there's still one more round left.\nLet's analyze offering [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1 which gives me\n(5-1) * 5 + (5-1) * 76 + (6-0) * 45 + (7-0) * 69 + (2-0) * 90 = 20 + 304 + 270 + 483 + 180 = 1257\nThis is very high, let's try to improve this by offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This yields\n5 * 5 + 5 * 76 + 6 * 45 + 7 * 69 + 2 * 90 = 25 + 380 + 270 + 483 + 180 = 1338.\nThis is the total value, and it's better than what player 1 previously offered me. This isn't sustainable as player 1 will never accept it.\n\nSince this is round 2, I should make an offer that is better than my outside offer * 0.9. 868 * 0.9 = 781.2\n\nLet me revert to the previous round's offer for me: [1, 1, 2, 3, 0]. If I offer this to player 1, the total value for me is 960.\nDiscounted by 0.9 = 960 * 0.9 = 864. Which is lower than my outside offer of 868.\n\nLet me provide a counteroffer, [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] which yields me 1257. And is better than my outside offer. This is mistake 1.\n\nLet's consider the middle ground between [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] and [1, 1, 0, 0, 0].\nOffer: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nMy total value is (5-1) * 5 + (5-1) * 76 + (6-1) * 45 + (7-1) * 69 + 2 * 90 = 20 + 304 + 225 + 414 + 180 = 1143. This is better than my outside option. Discounted by 0.9 is 1028.7\n\nOffer: [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nMy total value is (5-1) * 5 + (5-1) * 76 + (6-0) * 45 + (7-1) * 69 + 2 * 90 = 20 + 304 + 270 + 414 + 180 = 1188. Discounted by 0.9 is 1069.2\n\nOffer: [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nMy total value is (5-1) * 5 + (5-1) * 76 + (6-0) * 45 + (7-0) * 69 + 1 * 90 = 20 + 304 + 270 + 483 + 90 = 1167. Discounted by 0.9 = 1050.3\n\nOkay, let's go with the offer [1, 1, 0, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 670. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 969 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 403.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 47, item 2 = 64, item 3 = 10, item 4 = 55, item 5 = 11.\n*   The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in the next round will be worth 90% of its current value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer to *me* is [0, 1, 0, 4, 0]. This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  The total value of this offer to me is: (0 * 47) + (1 * 64) + (0 * 10) + (4 * 55) + (0 * 11) = 0 + 64 + 0 + 220 + 0 = 284. This is less than my outside offer of 403.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 403. Let's consider a few options. To calculate the value of a potential counteroffer, remember I'm calculating how much *I keep*, not how much I offer the other player.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** I need to ensure any offer I accept or propose results in a value greater than my outside offer of 403.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 284, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 403. Therefore, accepting is a Mistake 4.\n\nI need to decide whether to WALK or make a COUNTEROFFER. Walking guarantees me 403. A counteroffer only makes sense if I can obtain a value *greater* than 403, considering the discount factor if the negotiation extends to another round.\n\nLet's think about a possible counteroffer. My total value of all items is 589. To get more than 403, Player 1 needs to get less than 589 - 403 = 186 worth of items.\n\nLet's try offering the player 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. This means I keep 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. So the offer to Player 1 would be [2, 2, 5, 0, 3].\nThe value to me would be (0 * 47) + (1 * 64) + (0 * 10) + (4 * 55) + (0 * 11) = 0 + 64 + 0 + 220 + 0 = 284. This is not greater than the outside offer. \n\nLet's try offering the player 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. This leaves me with 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. The value to me would be (2 * 47) + (0 * 64) + (0 * 10) + (0 * 55) + (0 * 11) = 94. This is definitely less than the outside offer.\n\nGiven the current offer is bad and I don't have a clear counteroffer that's better than my outside offer right now, I will walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting an equivalent offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]. This means I keep:\n    *   item 1: 1 * 24 = 24\n    *   item 2: 1 * 87 = 87\n    *   item 3: 1 * 16 = 16\n    *   item 4: 1 * 14 = 14\n    *   item 5: 2 * 85 = 170\n    *   Total value of the current offer: 24 + 87 + 16 + 14 + 170 = 311\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 311 < 668. Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. Let me start by considering how much of each item I currently have, since the current offer is quite bad. If I kept all of the items:\n    * 3 * 24 = 72\n    * 2 * 87 = 174\n    * 3 * 16 = 48\n    * 3 * 14 = 42\n    * 6 * 85 = 510\n    * TOTAL = 846\n    I should aim for something better than my outside offer of 668.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer, so I should not accept it.\n*   I could walk away and take my outside offer, but it's only round 1 and I can probably get a better deal than my outside offer.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer. I will offer Player 1: item 1 = 1, item 2 = 0, item 3 = 1, item 4 = 1, item 5 = 2\n\nSo I would keep:\n    *   item 1: 2 * 24 = 48\n    *   item 2: 2 * 87 = 174\n    *   item 3: 2 * 16 = 32\n    *   item 4: 2 * 14 = 28\n    *   item 5: 4 * 85 = 340\n    *   Total value of my counteroffer: 48 + 174 + 32 + 28 + 340 = 622\nSince this is still worse than my outside offer, I will revise the offer to keep more.\n\nNew Counteroffer: offer Player 1: item 1 = 0, item 2 = 0, item 3 = 0, item 4 = 0, item 5 = 1\nSo I keep:\n    *   item 1: 3 * 24 = 72\n    *   item 2: 2 * 87 = 174\n    *   item 3: 3 * 16 = 48\n    *   item 4: 3 * 14 = 42\n    *   item 5: 5 * 85 = 425\n    *   Total value of my counteroffer: 72 + 174 + 48 + 42 + 425 = 761\nThis is much better than the outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 668\n*   **My item values:** item 1: 24, item 2: 87, item 3: 16, item 4: 14, item 5: 85\n*   **Total items:** item 1: 3, item 2: 2, item 3: 3, item 4: 3, item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 1, 1, 3].  This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   3 units of item 5\n\n    My value for this offer is:\n    (0 * 24) + (1 * 87) + (1 * 16) + (1 * 14) + (3 * 85) = 0 + 87 + 16 + 14 + 255 = 372.\n    Discounted value = 372 * 0.9 = 334.8\n\n    This is significantly less than my outside offer of 668.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  Let's consider what happens if I kept everything for myself:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 24 = 72\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 87 = 174\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 16 = 48\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 14 = 42\n    *   6 units of item 5: 6 * 85 = 510\n    *   Total value = 72 + 174 + 48 + 42 + 510 = 846.\n    Discounted value = 846 * 0.9 = 761.4\n\n    My previous counteroffer was [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I kept:\n     *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 24 = 72\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 87 = 174\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 16 = 48\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 14 = 42\n    *   5 units of item 5: 5 * 85 = 425\n    *   Total value = 72 + 174 + 48 + 42 + 425 = 761\n    Discounted value = 761 * 0.9 = 684.9\n\n    Since my previous offer was better for me than my outside offer, and still got rejected, I will try to move my offer to a more balanced position. Since it is round 2, I will move my offer toward an equal split. Since the game ends if Player 2 makes a counteroffer on the last round, I would rather make a more aggressive offer now, or WALK if my offer is not accepted.\n\n    Offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]. This means I would keep:\n    * 2 units of item 1: 2 * 24 = 48\n    * 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 87 = 87\n    * 2 units of item 3: 2 * 16 = 32\n    * 2 units of item 4: 2 * 14 = 28\n    * 3 units of item 5: 3 * 85 = 255\n    * Total value = 48 + 87 + 32 + 28 + 255 = 450\n    Discounted value = 450 * 0.9 = 405\n    This is worse than my outside offer.\n\n    I need to improve my offer such that I have a value greater than 668/0.9 = 742.22\n\n    If I offer Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]. This means I would keep:\n    * 2 units of item 1: 2 * 24 = 48\n    * 2 unit of item 2: 2 * 87 = 174\n    * 2 units of item 3: 2 * 16 = 32\n    * 2 units of item 4: 2 * 14 = 28\n    * 4 units of item 5: 4 * 85 = 340\n    * Total value = 48 + 174 + 32 + 28 + 340 = 622\n    Discounted value = 622 * 0.9 = 559.8\n    This is still worse than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of [0, 1, 1, 1, 3] is terrible since it yields me a value of only 334.8, which is less than my outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 148. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 585 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 489. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 810 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. We know our outside offer guarantees us a value of 489. In any deal we agree to, we must get at least 489 in undiscounted value (in round 1 the discount factor is 1) to make it worthwhile over our fallback.\n2. Our private values for the items are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 78 per unit (5 available)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 4 per unit (7 available)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 7 per unit (5 available)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 99 per unit (6 available)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 82 per unit (5 available)\n\u2003Our maximum potential total is 1457 if we got everything.\n3. Since we move first and no current offer exists, we choose to make an initial offer. We want to secure as much value as possible while still leaving the opponent with an attractive enough package so that they might consider accepting or at least not immediately reject the division.\n4. We observe that items 1, 4, and 5 have high value to us. Therefore, to maximize our outcome, we would like to keep all or most of those items. Items 2 and 3 are relatively low value to us so we can be more generous with those in our offer.\n5. One reasonable proposal is: offer the opponent all of the units of items 2 and 3, while keeping all of items 1, 4, and 5. Concretely, this means offering the opponent:\n\u2003\u2022 0 of item 1, 7 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n6. Under this offer, our allocation is:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 5 units \u2192 5 \u00d7 78 = 390\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 6 units \u2192 6 \u00d7 99 = 594\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 5 units \u2192 5 \u00d7 82 = 410\n\u2003Total value = 390 + 594 + 410 = 1394, which is far above our fallback value of 489.\n7. This offer does not commit any of our high-value items while still giving the opponent a full lot of the lower-value items (from our perspective). Although the opponent\u2019s values are private, this initial offer is a strong anchor since the opponent is likely to have relatively lower valuations for items 2 and 3.\n8. With this analysis in mind\u2014and ensuring we do not make any of the listed mistakes (we are not proposing an offer worse than our fallback, nor are we offering nothing or all items to the opponent)\u2014our best action in Round 1 is to propose this counteroffer.\n\nFinal action:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 7, 5, 0, 0]}",

As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "My reasoning:\n1. My outcome if negotiations fail (my outside offer) is worth 108 to me. My full potential (if I kept everything) is 1133. Also, there is a discount factor of 0.9 per extra round so waiting may cost value. Therefore, reaching an agreement now is preferable if it gives me well above 108.\n2. My item values are: \n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 68 (4 available),\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 89 (6),\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 20 (4),\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 41 (6),\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 1 (1).\n\u2003If I kept everything, I\u2019d profit enormously. But the opponent (Player 2) has their own private values and a fallback, so if I claim nearly everything my offer may be rejected.\n3. A fair\u2010splitting idea is to design an offer close to a 50\u201350 split of the \u201csurplus\u201d (here measured in my value) while keeping in mind the discount; in this negotiation I want to settle in Round\u202f1.\n4. Given my totals 4,6,4,6,1, one \u201cfair\u201d split by my own value would have me roughly keep 566 in value and leave the other roughly an equivalent amount. For example, if I offer to give Player\u202f2 the following quantities:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 2 units of item 1 (leaving me 2),\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 3 units of item 2 (leaving me 3),\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 2 units of item 3 (leaving me 2),\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 3 units of item 4 (leaving me 3),\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 the 1 unit of item 5 (all to them),\n\u2003then my retained items yield:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2\u00d768 = 136,\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 3\u00d789 = 267,\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 2\u00d720 = 40,\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 3\u00d741 = 123,\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 0\u00d71 = 0.\n\u2003Total = 136+267+40+123 = 566.\n5. This split is well above my fallback of 108 while giving the opponent an allocation that\u2014if they have typical values\u2014may roughly be equivalent to a fair share. It also avoids the pitfalls of offering too little (which might lead to a rejection and delay discounting) or offering too much (reducing my own value unnecessarily).\n6. Based on the above, a rational initial offer is to propose giving Player\u202f2 the vector [2, 3, 2, 3, 1]. \n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 2, 3, 1]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 420. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 597 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 952. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 834 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 839. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 810 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

My per\u2010unit values are 25, 53, 68, 11, and 61 respectively.\n\u2003\u2022 In total the items are worth 741 to me if I got everything.\n\u2003\u2022 Because we\u2019re in round 1 the discount is gamma^(1\u20131)=1; so an agreement now is best compared to waiting and risking a discount later.\n\n2) In weighing offers I must ensure that the share I keep (i.e. the items left after I give something over to Player 2) is worth at least the outside offer (203) in my own values. I also want to maximize my own share relative to the entire total. A very unkind offer might be rejected, but since I hold an outside option of 203 I can be quite demanding. I must also avoid the \u201cmistakes\u201d (for example, not offering \u201cno items\u201d to the opponent or ensuring that I keep value above my fallback).\n\n3) I plan an offer that significantly favors me. Since my highest-value items are items 2, 3, and 5 I want to keep these full. I can concede items that are lower in value \u2013 from my perspective item 1 (at 25 each is less attractive than 53, 68, or 61) and all of item 4 (worth 11 each) are natural concessions. For instance, an initial extreme proposal might be to grant only a minimal share of item 1 (1 unit) and give all of item 4 (4 units) to Player 2 while keeping everything else. That division yields for me:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: I keep 5 units = 5\u00d725 = 125\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: I keep 2 units = 2\u00d753 = 106\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: I keep 2 units = 2\u00d768 = 136\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: I keep 0 units = 0\u00d711 = 0\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: I keep 5 units = 5\u00d761 = 305\nThe total value for me is 125+106+136+0+305 = 672 \u2013 far above 203.\nThis offer is very aggressive but at this early stage, I can demand terms that heavily favor me provided that I still leave Player 2 something (so as to avoid \u201coffering nothing\u201d). \n\nThus, in my initial offer I propose to give Player 2:\n\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 1,\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 2,\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 3,\n\u2003\u2022 4 units of item 4,\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 5.\n\nThis offer avoids all 5 mistakes and guarantees that my share is far above my outside offer while still leaving some items for my opponent.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 4, 0]}",

My maximum total value (if I got all items) is 1487, so I have at most 1487\u00a0\u2013\u00a01380 = 107 \u201cpoints\u201d of extra value available to negotiate over. In other words, I must make sure that the deal I accept gives me at least 1380 in my own valuation. My own per\u2010unit values are highest on item\u00a02 (82), then items\u00a05 (57) and 4 (51), moderate on item\u00a01 (50), and lowest on item\u00a03 (22). Because I want to maximize my outcome I prefer to keep those items with high values. Therefore, if I want to \u201cgive\u201d something to the other party, I should give over the items that cost me the least. In this case item\u00a03 is very \u201ccheap\u201d to me (only 22 per unit) and there are 3 units available. Conceding all 3 units of item\u00a03 costs me 3\u00d722 = 66, leaving me with a deal value of 1487 \u2013 66 = 1421 which is safely above my outside offer of 1380. (Any attempt to concede an additional unit from another item would cost me at least 50 extra points, risking my total falling below or too near my fallback.) \n\nI realize that by offering only item\u00a03 (all 3 units) to Player\u00a02, I leave myself with the higher\u2010valued items and nearly all of their total value. (Even though handing over just 3 units might be unattractive for Player\u00a02 if they have high private values, my fallback is so strong that I am in a good negotiating position.) \n\nThus, as my initial offer in round\u00a01 I propose to give Player\u00a02 the 3 units of item\u00a03 and keep the rest.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I\u2019ll explain my thought process briefly before giving my action. \n\nMy outside offer guarantees a value of 378. In the full pool the items\u2019 total value to me adds up to 1260. In order to do better than the fallback (378) and also appeal to Player\u00a02, I want to propose a division where I secure most of the high\u2010value items while offering a \u201cfair\u201d share relative to my own valuations. Based on my unit values\u2014\n\u2022 Item\u00a01 (2 units, 27 each): low total value (54). Splitting 1 unit each makes sense.\n\u2022 Item\u00a02 (6 units, 42 each): splitting 3 units apiece gives me 126.\n\u2022 Item\u00a03 (6 units, 17 each): splitting evenly (3 each) gives me 51.\n\u2022 Item\u00a04 (6 units, 90 each): a fair division gives 3 each (giving me 270), though this is one of my top items.\n\u2022 Item\u00a05 (4 units, 78 each): a 2\u20132 split yields 156.\n\nWith that division I would secure a total value of 27 + 126 + 51 + 270 + 156 = 630 \u2013 a strong improvement over 378. This division is \u201cfair\u201d from my perspective and likely acceptable enough for Player\u00a02 to consider (since we don\u2019t know their values, an even split of counts seems a reasonable starting point).\n\nThus, I propose offering Player\u00a02 the following amounts: \n\u2003Item\u00a01: 1 unit, \n\u2003Item\u00a02: 3 units, \n\u2003Item\u00a03: 3 units, \n\u2003Item\u00a04: 3 units, and \n\u2003Item\u00a05: 2 units.\n\nI now provide my action as required.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 3, 3, 2]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1445. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 888 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 68. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 711 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I must ensure that my taken value is more than my fallback of 156.\n\u2022 For example, if I propose to give Player 2: [1, 2, 1, 2, 0] units for items 1 to 5 respectively then I get:\n\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units \u2192 2\u00d740 = 80\n\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 6 \u2013 2 = 4 units \u2192 4\u00d754 = 216\n\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 4 \u2013 1 = 3 units \u2192 3\u00d739 = 117\n\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 5 \u2013 2 = 3 units \u2192 3\u00d732 = 96\n\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 2 \u2013 0 = 2 units \u2192 2\u00d784 = 168\n\u2003Total = 80 + 216 + 117 + 96 + 168 = 677, which is well above 156.\n\u2022 This counteroffer is appealing for me and gives the opponent some share of the goods to potentially induce acceptance.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Decision:\n\u2022 I will not accept any current offer (there is none).\n\u2022 I will not walk away because I can secure a deal worth well more than my fallback.\n\u2022 I will propose a counteroffer that gives Player 2 the following units: [1, 2, 1, 2, 0].

Offering the full 2 units of item2 to Player 2 would give them some \u201cstake\u201d in the deal while letting me keep almost the entire pool.\n4.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "My analysis is as follows:\n\n1) Situation analysis:\n\u2003\u2022 My outside offer is worth 156. That is my guaranteed value if negotiations break down.\n\u2003\u2022 I value each item as follows: item1 at 28, item2 at 35, item3 at 97, item4 at 79, and item5 at 5. The total value if I got every unit of the available items (2,3,2,3,2 respectively) would be 602.\n\u2003\u2022 The pool of items is: 2 units of item1, 3 units of item2, 2 units of item3, 3 units of item4, and 2 units of item5.\n\u2003\u2022 Because we are in round 1 (with no discount loss yet since gamma^(0)=1), any deal reached now preserves full value. Waiting (or moving to later rounds) incurs a discount (gamma = 0.9 per subsequent round), so it is preferable to conclude a deal in round 1 provided the division is acceptable.\n\n2) Assessing offers:\n\u2003\u2022 In a counteroffer, I determine the division by specifying the number of units I give to Player 2. I keep what remains.\n\u2003\u2022 My objective is to maximize my outcome, but I must offer Player 2 enough so that their expected value from my offer (given their own private values and fallback possibilities) is at least competitive with their outside offer. I do not know Player 2\u2019s exact values, but if we assume that on average they might value items around 50\u201351 per unit (given their range of 1 to 101), then the offer to them should be high enough to reach an expected value above roughly 156.\n\u2003\u2022 Given my high values for item3 (97) and item4 (79) compared to the rest, I want to keep all of those items. I can afford to concede some units of item1, item2, or item5. For example, if I offer them 1 unit of item1 (worth 28 to me), 2 units of item2 (worth 2\u00d735 =70 to me), and 1 unit of item5 (worth 5 to me), then I am giving them a likely estimated value (using an estimated opponent value of around 51 per unit) of around: 51 (item1) + 102 (item2) + 51 (item5) = 204. This is competitive compared to an expected fallback and should help induce acceptance.\n\u2003\u2022 In that case I keep for myself: \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item1: 1 unit (1\u00d728 = 28)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item2: 1 unit (1\u00d735 = 35)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item3: all 2 units (2\u00d797 = 194)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item4: all 3 units (3\u00d779 = 237)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item5: 1 unit (1\u00d75 = 5)\n\u2003\u2022 The total for me would be 28 + 35 + 194 + 237 + 5 = 499, which is much larger than my fallback value of 156.\n\u2003\u2022 This counteroffer avoids the common mistakes: it provides an offer that is far better for me than my fallback, and it does not offer nothing or all items. It is also not making an offer worse than a previous offer.\n\n3) Decision:\n\u2003\u2022 I do not accept any current offer because there is none.\n\u2003\u2022 I do not WALK since the potential deal is far better than my fallback.\n\u2003\u2022 Therefore, based on the analysis, I propose the following counteroffer in round 1.\n\nMy action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1,2,0,0,1]}",

With our private values\u201474 for item 1, 63 for item 2, 96 for item 3, 36 for item 4, and 12 for item 5\u2014the full bundle is worth 1225. We want a deal that leaves us substantially above 498.\n3. In our counteroffer, we propose to give Player 2 a share so that we keep a favorable portion of the high-value items while still offering Player 2 something to make the deal attractive. One reasonable proposal is to offer Player 2 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, no units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n4. Under this offer the remaining amounts for us would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 5 \u2013 2 = 3 units \u2192 3\u00d774 = 222  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 5 \u2013 2 = 3 units \u2192 3\u00d763 = 189  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 5 \u2013 2 = 3 units \u2192 3\u00d796 = 288  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 1 \u2013 0 = 1 unit \u2003\u2192 1\u00d736 = 36  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2 \u2013 1 = 1 unit \u2003\u2192 1\u00d712 = 12  \n\u2003Total value = 222 + 189 + 288 + 36 + 12 = 747  \nThis value is well above our outside offer of 498.\n5. The proposed counteroffer avoids the listed mistakes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 It does not give us less than our outside offer.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 It is not a \u201cno items\u201d or \u201call items\u201d offer.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 It secures a higher immediate value while still leaving some items for the opponent, which may lead them to agree.\n6. Thus, our action is to propose the counteroffer [2, 2, 2, 0, 1] for Player 2 (meaning Player 2 gets that many units, and we keep the remainder).\n\nFinal action:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 0, 1]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Because item 4 and item 5 are extremely valuable to me, I want to keep all of them. Items that are of low value to me (items 2 and 3, with values 2 each) can be conceded.\n5. For item 1 (value 9 per unit) it can be worth giving up a small number of units in order to provide a \u201cfair\u201d enough division for Player 2 while retaining much of my surplus. By offering 2 out of 7 units, I keep 5 units of item 1.\n6.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "My reasoning:\n1. Our guaranteed outside option gives us 327 in value. We have a total value potential (if we got everything) of 1186. Since we discount future rounds, it is best to negotiate in round 1 so we do not lose value.\n2. We want to propose an offer that gives us a high value outcome above 327 while leaving just enough for Player 2 \u2013 assuming they will need a share that makes them at least as well off as their own unknown outside offer.\n3. Given the total items [0,6,6,4,5] and our own item values (37, 30, 54, 63, 86), claiming nearly everything for ourselves would yield us a very high total (for instance, keeping nearly all items gives us over 900). However, if we give too little to Player 2 they might reject our offer.\n4. To try to avoid mistakes such as offering less to ourselves than our outside offer or proposing an offer that is overly stingy, a balanced counteroffer is to concede a moderate number of units to Player 2. One reasonable proposal is to offer them 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. Then our allocation would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 0 (we both have 0)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 6 \u2013 2 = 4 units\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192 4 \u00d7 30 = 120\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 6 \u2013 2 = 4 units\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192 4 \u00d7 54 = 216\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 4 \u2013 1 = 3 units\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192 3 \u00d7 63 = 189\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 5 \u2013 2 = 3 units\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n\u2003\u2003Total for us = 120 + 216 + 189 + 258 = 783, which is well above our fallback value.\n5.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 313. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 313. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 414 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "My reasoning:\n1. My outside offer is 313. I must ensure that whatever offer I propose gives me a value of at least 313.\n2. The total available quantities are: item 1: 3 units, item 2: 4 units, item 3: 4 units, item 4: 4 units, item 5: 2 units.\n3. My per\u2010unit values are: item 1 = 35, item 2 = 50, item 3 = 19, item 4 = 21, item 5 = 13. If I kept all items, my value would be 491.\n4. The discount factor in round 1 is gamma^(0)=1, which means there is no discount yet. I should secure more than 313 now to avoid risking a lower discounted payoff in later rounds.\n5. I want to minimize my concessions while leaving the opponent a chance to accept. To ensure I get slightly above 313, I calculate an example division. For instance, if I offer the opponent:\n   \u2022 1 unit of item 1 (I keep 2): my value = 2\u00d735 = 70.\n   \u2022 2 units of item 2 (I keep 2): my value = 2\u00d750 = 100.\n   \u2022 1 unit of item 3 (I keep 3): my value = 3\u00d719 = 57.\n   \u2022 1 unit of item 4 (I keep 3): my value = 3\u00d721 = 63.\n   \u2022 0 units of item 5 (I keep 2): my value = 2\u00d713 = 26.\n   Total value for me = 70 + 100 + 57 + 63 + 26 = 316, which is above my outside offer.\n6. This offer avoids the mistakes of giving too little compared to my fallback, and it does not propose a \"nothing\" or \"all\" situation. It is a reasonable first offer that leaves some value for Player 2 while ensuring I get slightly more than 313.\n   \nBased on this analysis, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]}",
