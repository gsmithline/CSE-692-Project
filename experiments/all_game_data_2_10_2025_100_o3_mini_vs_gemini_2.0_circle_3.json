This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth 90% of what it would be worth this round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 4, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 23) + (0 * 94) + (1 * 32) + (4 * 26) + (0 * 48) = 0 + 0 + 32 + 104 + 0 = 136.\n    *   Since 136 is less than my outside offer of 227, accepting the current offer is not a good idea.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, taking into account the discount factor. I want to maximize my value while giving Player 1 enough to make them accept.\n    *   I have 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 10 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5 to divide.\n    *   Total value of all items to me is (3 * 23) + (1 * 94) + (4 * 32) + (10 * 26) + (3 * 48) = 69 + 94 + 128 + 260 + 144 = 695.\n    *   If I gave player 1 nothing and kept everything, my value would be 695.\n\nLet's try to create a counteroffer that is better for me than my outside option of 227, and perhaps attractive to Player 1. It seems like Player 1 likes item 4, as they are trying to keep most of it. Let's consider giving them a bit more of item 4, and a bit of other items.\nHere's a possible counteroffer: I offer Player 1 [1, 0, 2, 6, 1].\n\n*   This means I keep 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n*   My value would then be: (2 * 23) + (1 * 94) + (2 * 32) + (4 * 26) + (2 * 48) = 46 + 94 + 64 + 104 + 96 = 404.\n\nSince 404 > 227, this is a better option than walking away.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is not acceptable.\n*   Walking away is not optimal.\n*   I will make a counteroffer of [1, 0, 2, 6, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 6, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 674. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 0, 2, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 0, 2, 6]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 674\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 65, Item 2: 20, Item 3: 88, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 51\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 7, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 6, Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [3, 0, 0, 2, 6]. This means I get 3 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 6 of item 5.\n\n    Value of current offer:\n    (3 * 65) + (0 * 20) + (0 * 88) + (2 * 1) + (6 * 51) = 195 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 306 = 503\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 503, which is less than my outside offer of 674. Therefore, accepting this offer is not ideal.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what a reasonable counteroffer might be. Since Player 1 is offering me all of item 1, almost half of item 4, and all of item 5, I should consider what items they value. I value item 3 highly, so I would want to keep most or all of that. I also value item 1 relatively highly, so I want to keep that, too. Item 2 has the lowest value.\n\n    Let's consider a scenario where I offer Player 1 all of item 2 and some of item 4: [0, 7, 0, 4, 0]\n    This means I keep:\n    3 of item 1 = 3 * 65 = 195\n    0 of item 2 = 0 * 20 = 0\n    4 of item 3 = 4 * 88 = 352\n    2 of item 4 = 2 * 1 = 2\n    6 of item 5 = 6 * 51 = 306\n    Total value = 195 + 0 + 352 + 2 + 306 = 855\n\n    This counteroffer significantly exceeds my outside offer value of 674, even after applying the discount factor in later rounds. Since this is round 1, the value of the counteroffer would be 855 * (0.9^0) = 855.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is unacceptable.\n*   Walking away is not ideal, as I believe I can negotiate a better outcome.\n*   I will make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 all of item 2 and some of item 4.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 7, 0, 4, 0]}\n```",

My total value if I got everything would be 863 calculated as:\n\u2003Item 1: 6\u00d790 = 540  \n\u2003Item 2: 3\u00d76  = 18  \n\u2003Item 3: 5\u00d758 = 290  \n\u2003Item 4: 2\u00d76  = 12  \n\u2003Item 5: 1\u00d73  = 3  \n\n2) Since I have control in round 1 (with no current opponent offer) and no discounting today (\u03b3^(1\u20131)=1), I want to propose a division where I get a share clearly above 404. At the same time, I must leave the opponent a bundle that is attractive enough relative to their own (unknown) values and outside option. I want to give away items that I value less while keeping more of the high\u2010value items (like item 1 and item 3).\n\n3) One natural approach is to \u201csplit\u201d the goods in a somewhat balanced way according to my known valuation. For example, splitting item 1 (6 units) evenly gives each 3 units. For item 2 (3 units) an almost even split (giving the opponent 1 unit and me 2) seems appropriate. Similarly, for item 3 (5 units) I can give them 2 and keep 3. For item 4 (2 units) splitting 1\u20131 makes sense. For item 5 (only 1 unit), I keep it to boost my outcome.\n\n4) Under that division my share is:\n\u2003Item 1: 3 units \u2192 3\u00d790 = 270  \n\u2003Item 2: 2 units \u2192 2\u00d76  = 12  \n\u2003Item 3: 3 units \u2192 3\u00d758 = 174  \n\u2003Item 4: 1 unit  \u2192 1\u00d76  = 6  \n\u2003Item 5: 1 unit  \u2192 1\u00d73  = 3  \n\u2003Total = 270+12+174+6+3 = 465, which is comfortably above the 404 outside offer.\n\n5) The corresponding counteroffer format (listing what I am giving to the opponent) is therefore: [3, 1, 2, 1, 0].\n\nBased on the above analysis, I will propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 1, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step to make the best decision.\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n   - My outside offer value is 7.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 33, item 2 = 55, item 3 = 58, item 4 = 70, item 5 = 49.\n   - The total pool of items is: 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal reached in a later round is worth less than a deal reached now. Accepting an offer now yields its full value, while accepting in round 2 multiplies value by 0.9, and round 3 by 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - The current offer is [3, 1, 2, 1, 0]. This means I receive:\n      - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 33 = 99\n      - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 55 = 55\n      - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 58 = 116\n      - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 70 = 70\n      - 0 units of item 5: 0 * 49 = 0\n      - Total value of current offer: 99 + 55 + 116 + 70 + 0 = 340\n\n   - Comparison to outside offer: The current offer is worth 340, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 7.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: It's round 1, so I have room to negotiate. I want to maximize my value while considering the discount factor in later rounds and the need to give Player 1 enough to make a deal worthwhile for them, too.\nI have 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.  The other player is offering me [3, 1, 2, 1, 0].  This means they are taking [3, 2, 3, 1, 1]. If I were to ask for everything and give the other player nothing my value would be:\n      - 6 units of item 1: 6 * 33 = 198\n      - 3 units of item 2: 3 * 55 = 165\n      - 5 units of item 3: 5 * 58 = 290\n      - 2 units of item 4: 2 * 70 = 140\n      - 1 units of item 5: 1 * 49 = 49\n      - Total value : 198 + 165 + 290 + 140 + 49 = 842\n\n   I want to ask for more than the other player is currently offering and see if they accept it in the next round.\n   I will make a counteroffer where I keep 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 1 of item 5. Therefore I offer the player 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n   - The current offer is significantly better than my outside offer, but there's room for negotiation.\n   - I will make a counteroffer that is closer to what I want to see if the other player is willing to move closer to my ideal distribution.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1026. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 930 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 626.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 53, item 2 = 32, item 3 = 33, item 4 = 54, item 5 = 22.\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 0, 3, 5]. This means I get:\n      - 0 units of item 1\n      - 0 units of item 2\n      - 0 units of item 3\n      - 3 units of item 4\n      - 5 units of item 5\n      My total value for this offer is: (0 * 53) + (0 * 32) + (0 * 33) + (3 * 54) + (5 * 22) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 162 + 110 = 272.\n   - This value (272) is significantly less than my outside offer (626).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Since the current offer is so low, I need to make a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value while also making the offer attractive enough for Player 1 to potentially accept. Given the discount factor, I want to aim for a deal in this round. Let's try to find a reasonable counteroffer. I have 4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 5 of item 3. \n\n    Here are a couple of example counteroffer calculations:\n\n    a) Let's consider an equal split of item 1, item 2, item 3, and I get all of item 4 and item 5.\n    I offer player 1: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n    I keep: [2, 2, 3, 3, 5]\n    My Value = (2*53) + (2*32) + (3*33) + (3*54) + (5*22) = 106 + 64 + 99 + 162 + 110 = 541\n\n    b) A more generous offer to Player 1. Offer half or slightly more than half of each.\n    I offer player 1: [2, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n    I keep: [2, 2, 2, 2, 3]\n    My Value = (2*53) + (2*32) + (2*33) + (2*54) + (3*22) = 106 + 64 + 66 + 108 + 66 = 410\n    \n    Clearly both of these are below my outside offer. My current items are worth 777. I need to secure at least 80% of the items to make a deal preferable to walking away. The current offer from player 1 suggests they highly value item 4 and item 5. I should try and give them more of Item 1, 2 and 3. Let me try to get the value to above 626. Let's say I give them half or more of Items 1, 2 and 3.\n\n    I offer player 1: [2, 2, 3, 0, 0]\n    I keep: [2, 2, 2, 3, 5]\n    My Value = (2*53) + (2*32) + (2*33) + (3*54) + (5*22) = 106 + 64 + 66 + 162 + 110 = 508\n    \n    I offer player 1: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n    I keep: [3, 3, 4, 3, 5]\n    My Value = (3*53) + (3*32) + (4*33) + (3*54) + (5*22) = 159 + 96 + 132 + 162 + 110 = 659\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is unacceptable.\n   - My outside offer is 626.\n   - A counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 0, 0] will result in a value to me of 659, which is preferable to walking away.

This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: [0, 0, 0, 3, 5] (I receive 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 5 of item 5)\n      - My value for current offer: (0 * 53) + (0 * 32) + (0 * 33) + (3 * 54) + (5 * 22) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 162 + 110 = 272\n      - Discounted value of current offer in round 2: 272 * 0.9 = 244.8\n      - Since 244.8 < 626, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to offer something to Player 1 to get a better deal. Since it's round 2, I want to make Player 1 accept my offer. To do that I need to offer player 1 something better than walking away, or the discounted value of anything they could get by delaying until the last round. Since I don't know what player 1's value function is, I need to estimate. Player 1 has made the same offer twice, so I assume their value for item 4 and 5 are relatively low. Item 1 and item 2 and item 3 might therefore be high. I will make an offer that gives them all of item 1 and 2 and most of item 3.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is bad. My outside offer is much better.\n   - I will make a counteroffer that takes into account the available item pool.\n\nMy counteroffer will give Player 1 all of item 1, item 2 and 4 units of item 3, and 0 of items 4 and 5:\n[4, 4, 4, 0, 0] to player 1. This means I will keep 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 5 of item 5. My value would be (0 * 53) + (0 * 32) + (1 * 33) + (3 * 54) + (5 * 22) = 0 + 0 + 33 + 162 + 110 = 305.\nThis times the discount factor is 274.5, still lower than my outside offer.\nLet's try a different offer.\n\nLet's offer Player 1: [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\nThis leaves me with: [2, 2, 3, 2, 4]\nMy value: (2 * 53) + (2 * 32) + (3 * 33) + (2 * 54) + (4 * 22) = 106 + 64 + 99 + 108 + 88 = 465\nDiscounted Value: 465 * 0.9 = 418.5 still less than my outside option.\n\nLet's just take my outside option because I think it is better.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less to both players.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [3, 1, 0, 1, 2]. This means I get 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer is (3 * 51) + (1 * 19) + (0 * 47) + (1 * 24) + (2 * 24) = 153 + 19 + 0 + 24 + 48 = 244.\n    *   Since 244 < 623, accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few potential counteroffers to see if we can find something better than walking away, keeping in mind Player 1 originally asked for [3,1,0,1,2] which means I would be getting [4,1,1,2,3]\n\nLet's see what a more balanced offer for me might look like, where Player 1 gets close to equal benefit. This is hard without knowing their values.\n\n*   Counteroffer Example 1: Offer Player 1 all of item 1, item 2, half of item 4, all of item 3, half of item 5: [7, 2, 1, 1.5, 2.5] - (rounded down to [7,2,1,1,2]) which means I get 0 of Item 1, 0 of Item 2, 0 of Item 3, 2 of Item 4 and 3 of Item 5.\n    *   My value would be (0 * 51) + (0 * 19) + (0 * 47) + (2 * 24) + (3 * 24) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 48 + 72 = 120\n    *   This is lower than the current offer to me, so not a viable counteroffer.\n\n*   Counteroffer Example 2: Offer Player 1 almost nothing [0,0,0,0,0]. This means I keep all items.\n    *   My value: (7 * 51) + (2 * 19) + (1 * 47) + (3 * 24) + (5 * 24) = 357 + 38 + 47 + 72 + 120 = 634.\n    *   634 > 623 so this is better than my outside offer. I should push for this.\n\n*   Counteroffer Example 3: Giving Player 1 the exact amount of item 5 they want: [0,0,0,0,2]\n    *   My value would be (7 * 51) + (2 * 19) + (1 * 47) + (3 * 24) + (3 * 24) = 357 + 38 + 47 + 72 + 72 = 586\n    *   586 < 623 so this is less than my outside offer.\n\n*   Counteroffer Example 4: Giving Player 1 1 Unit of Item 1, item 2, item 4 and item 5 [1,1,0,1,1]\n\n    *   My value would be (6 * 51) + (1 * 19) + (1 * 47) + (2 * 24) + (4 * 24) = 306 + 19 + 47 + 48 + 96 = 516\n    *   516 < 623 so this is less than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   Offering a counteroffer of all items to myself results in a value higher than my outside offer. This seems like the best option, especially since we are in round 1, and I would need a very significant offer in round 2 to be worth it.\n\nTherefore, I will propose a counteroffer that gives the other player nothing.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 623.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 51, item 2 = 19, item 3 = 47, item 4 = 24, item 5 = 24.\n*   The total pool of items is: 7 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. Since this is round 2, accepting now means my value is multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 1, 0, 1, 2]. This means I get 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (3 * 51) + (1 * 19) + (0 * 47) + (1 * 24) + (2 * 24) = 153 + 19 + 0 + 24 + 48 = 244.\n    *   Discounted value of accepting now: 244 * 0.9 = 219.6.\n*   This value (219.6) is significantly less than my outside offer of 623.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept would look like. I need to retain enough items to exceed my discounted outside offer value (623 * 0.9 = 560.7). I'll aim to get as close as possible to a fair split, while making sure I get more than 560.7. Let's calculate the total value of all items for me: (7 * 51) + (2 * 19) + (1 * 47) + (3 * 24) + (5 * 24) = 357 + 38 + 47 + 72 + 120 = 634. Half of this total value would be 317.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 a little more than half of each item.\n* Offer: [4, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n* Value to me: (3*51)+(1*19)+(0*47)+(1*24)+(2*24) = 153 + 19 + 0 + 24 + 48 = 244\n* Value to Player 1: This calculation depends on Player 1's values, which are not known.\n* Discounted value to me: 244 * 0.9 = 219.6\n\nLet's consider an alternative offer.\n* I need to get at least 560.7 value. The maximum I can get in the next round is 634.\n* I will offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n* Value to me: (6 * 51) + (2 * 19) + (1 * 47) + (3 * 24) + (5 * 24) = 306 + 38 + 47 + 72 + 120 = 583.\n* Discounted value to me: 583 * 0.9 = 524.7. This is still below 560.7 so not good enough.\n\nLet's calculate another offer.\n* I will offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n* Value to me: 634\n* Discounted Value: 634 * 0.9 = 570.6\n\n*   **Comparison:** The current offer, even discounted, is much lower than my outside offer. Making a counteroffer is likely the best option.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe only offer I can reasonably make that ensures I can achieve my goals is to offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] in the hopes that Player 1 is feeling generous and will make a new offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 450. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 555 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 450.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1: 55, item 2: 58, item 3: 33, item 4: 17, item 5: 22.\n*   The total pool of items is: item 1: 3, item 2: 5, item 3: 5, item 4: 6, item 5: 3.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of what it's worth in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of what it's worth in round 1. This incentivizes me to accept good offers sooner rather than later, but also makes it more worthwhile to make an optimal counteroffer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]. This means:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 55 = 55\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 58 = 116\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 33 = 66\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 17 = 51\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 22 = 22\n    *   Total value of current offer: 55 + 116 + 66 + 51 + 22 = 310\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (310) is less than my outside offer (450).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I need to consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value while giving Player 1 enough to accept. Let's consider what it would take for me to get more than my outside offer.\n\n    *   I have items: item 1: 3, item 2: 5, item 3: 5, item 4: 6, item 5: 3\n    *   Player 1 is currently offering me: item 1: 1, item 2: 2, item 3: 2, item 4: 3, item 5: 1\n    *   Which means Player 1 currently has: item 1: 2, item 2: 3, item 3: 3, item 4: 3, item 5: 2\n\n    I need to give Player 1 some combination of the available resources. I want to keep as much as possible, but more than 450. Let's say I keep everything except: Item 1: 0, Item 2: 0, Item 3: 0, Item 4: 0, Item 5: 0, This equals 788 total value. I can give up as much as 338 value to Player 1 and be at my outside offer. Let's offer the player: 1 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5\n\n    Counteroffer Calculation:\n    I give Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n    This means I keep [2, 4, 4, 5, 2]\n    2 * 55 + 4 * 58 + 4 * 33 + 5 * 17 + 2 * 22 = 110 + 232 + 132 + 85 + 44 = 603\n    603 > 450 so this offer is greater than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is not acceptable, so I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This means any deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the face value and any deal in round 3 will be worth 0.81 times the face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I get 1 unit of each item. The value to me is:\n    (1 * 55) + (1 * 58) + (1 * 33) + (1 * 17) + (1 * 22) = 185\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 185 * 0.9 = 166.5. This is far less than my outside offer of 450.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I want to find a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept and that gives me a value greater than 450/0.9 = 500. I have the following items:\n    item 1: 3, item 2: 5, item 3: 5, item 4: 6, item 5: 3.\n    I need to keep enough to exceed 500. Let's try giving them very little.

That is more than enough.\n    Since player 1 previously offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], an offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] might not be acceptable to them. We want to give them something to incentivise them to accept a counteroffer. Let's examine what happened in Round 1. In Round 1, Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 3, 1], then Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n    Let's test a counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n    I keep:\n    item 1: 2, item 2: 4, item 3: 4, item 4: 5, item 5: 2\n    (2 * 55) + (4 * 58) + (4 * 33) + (5 * 17) + (2 * 22) = 110 + 232 + 132 + 85 + 44 = 603.\n    603 * 0.9 = 542.7 which is greater than my outside offer of 450.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible.

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now. Specifically, accepting in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of accepting in round 1, and accepting in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value of accepting in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 4]. This means Player 1 is giving me 1 unit of item 1 and 4 units of item 5.\n      - Value of 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 43 = 43\n      - Value of 4 units of item 5: 4 * 18 = 72\n      - Total value of current offer: 43 + 72 = 115\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that would give me a value greater than 899 (my outside offer), or a discounted value greater than 899 in future rounds. Let's consider keeping everything for myself.\n      - Value of 0 unit of item 1 to P1: 0 * 43 = 0\n      - Value of 0 unit of item 2 to P1: 0 * 92 = 0\n      - Value of 0 unit of item 3 to P1: 0 * 60 = 0\n      - Value of 0 unit of item 4 to P1: 0 * 78 = 0\n      - Value of 0 unit of item 5 to P1: 0 * 18 = 0\n      - Value of 1 unit of item 1 to me: 1 * 43 = 43\n      - Value of 3 units of item 2 to me: 3 * 92 = 276\n      - Value of 5 units of item 3 to me: 5 * 60 = 300\n      - Value of 2 units of item 4 to me: 2 * 78 = 156\n      - Value of 7 units of item 5 to me: 7 * 18 = 126\n      - My Total value = 43 + 276 + 300 + 156 + 126 = 901\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (115) is significantly less than my outside offer (899). Keeping everything gives me 901.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer would give me a value of 115, which is much worse than my outside offer of 899.\n   - If I keep everything, I get a value of 901, which is a slight improvement on my outside offer.\n   - Therefore, I should make a counteroffer that gets me close to 901, or walk away.\n   - Let's try to leave Player 1 with as little value as possible without forcing a walk from them. Assume they value each item the same as me.\n\nI will make a counteroffer giving Player 1 the minimal possible amount of items. So give them zero of everything.\n   - Counteroffer to Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n   - My value: 901\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

It might be worth taking a slightly worse deal now than risking getting my outside offer. For example, if Player 1 values item 1 a lot, perhaps they might want both units and would give up more of another item. I need to decide how much to offer Player 1 to get the best deal for myself while accounting for risk and the time value of money.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of 534 is very good, much better than my outside offer of 250. Even with a discount factor in later rounds, I'm better off taking the current offer. There is no benefit to making a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 438.\n   - My values for items 1-5 are 24, 4, 37, 97, 48 respectively.\n   - The total items are 6 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 6 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth 90% of its value in the current round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n      - Value of current offer: (0 * 24) + (1 * 4) + (0 * 37) + (0 * 97) + (2 * 48) = 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 96 = 100.\n   - **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer's value (100) is significantly lower than my outside offer (438).\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**  I need to figure out a counteroffer that maximizes my value, considering Player 1 also needs to accept it. Let's consider a few simple cases:\n       - Offer Player 1 all of Item 1, Item 5, and item 2, while keeping the rest. I offer [6, 4, 0, 0, 6]. I keep items [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], which gives me a value of 1 * 37 = 37. This is worse than my outside offer.\n       - If I take all items, my value will be (6 * 24) + (4 * 4) + (1 * 37) + (0 * 97) + (6 * 48) = 144 + 16 + 37 + 0 + 288 = 485.\n     Since there are only three rounds to negotiate, the maximum discount is 0.9^2 = 0.81. In the worst case, 0.81 * 485 is larger than the outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer is terrible.\n   - Walking away guarantees me 438.\n   - I should make a counteroffer that is significantly better for me than the current offer, but also offers some value to Player 1.\n\n   Let's start by offering Player 1 a relatively small portion of the items and keeping the rest.

This means any deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value, and any deal in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its value.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n      - Value of current offer: (0 * 24) + (1 * 4) + (0 * 37) + (0 * 97) + (2 * 48) = 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 96 = 100\n      - Discounted value of current offer: 100 * 0.9 = 90\n      - Since 90 is less than my outside offer of 438, accepting the current offer is not ideal.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I want to find a division that gives me a value greater than 438 / 0.9 = 486.67. I want to maximize my own value.\n       - I have: item 1: 6, item 2: 4, item 3: 1, item 4: 0, item 5: 6\n       - Let's consider giving Player 1 nothing of items 3 and 4, as I value item 3 high and there is no item 4.\n\n       - Attempt 1: I offer [6, 4, 1, 0, 6] to Player 1. That would leave me with 0 of everything. Value: 0.  Not good.\n\n       - Let's try to offer Player 1 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, all of items 3 and 4 (which is 1 and 0 respectively), and 3 of item 5: [3, 2, 1, 0, 3]. This leaves me with [3, 2, 0, 0, 3].\n          - My value: (3 * 24) + (2 * 4) + (0 * 37) + (0 * 97) + (3 * 48) = 72 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 144 = 224\n          - This is less than 486.67, so this counteroffer is also bad.\n\n       - I could try offering only item 1 and item 5 to player 1 to keep the higher value item 3 for myself. Offering Player 1: [6, 0, 0, 0, 6]. I get [0, 4, 1, 0, 0].\n          - My value: (0 * 24) + (4 * 4) + (1 * 37) + (0 * 97) + (0 * 48) = 0 + 16 + 37 + 0 + 0 = 53.\n          - This is less than 486.67, so this counteroffer is also bad.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me a discounted value of 90.\n   - Walking away gives me 438.\n   - I'm unlikely to find a better deal in round 3 since it will be discounted by 0.81. To be beneficial it will have to have an undiscounted value of more than 438/0.81 = 540.74.\n\nSince I don't have a good sense of Player 1's values, I am unwilling to concede more value to them.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: [0, 0, 3, 1, 4] (what I receive)\n     - Value of current offer: (0 * 83) + (0 * 85) + (3 * 76) + (1 * 42) + (4 * 76) = 0 + 0 + 228 + 42 + 304 = 574\n     - Since 574 > 374, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *in this round*.\n\n   - Potential Counteroffers: I need to consider what I can realistically get away with. Since I want to maximize my value, I should try to keep as many items as possible with high value for me.\n\n   - Comparison to outside offer: As calculated above, accepting the current offer yields a value of 574, which is substantially better than my outside offer of 374.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    - If I accept the current offer, my value is 574.\n\n    - I will consider a few potential counteroffers:\n\n      *Option 1: Give them all of Item 4.*\n      My offer to P1: [4, 6, 3, 0, 9]\n      My holdings: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] which values at 42, compared to 374 and 574 this is not competitive.\n\n      *Option 2: Giving slightly less of Item 5*\n      I will calculate a split to only improve my situation a bit.\n      Give: [0, 0, 3, 1, 3]\n      My holdings: [4, 6, 0, 0, 6] = (4*83) + (6*85) + (0*76) + (0*42) + (6*76) = 332 + 510 + 0 + 0 + 456 = 1298\n\n    Given that I can get 574 by accepting the current offer, and my outside offer is only 374, I will aim for something better.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 374.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 83, item 2 = 85, item 3 = 76, item 4 = 42, item 5 = 76.\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 9 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. Accepting an offer now is worth more than accepting it next round because of the time discount.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 5]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5. The value to me is:\n      (0 * 83) + (0 * 85) + (3 * 76) + (0 * 42) + (5 * 76) = 0 + 0 + 228 + 0 + 380 = 608\n   - This value (608) is greater than my outside offer of 374.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Since the current offer exceeds my outside offer, I should only consider counteroffers that give me even more value. Let's explore a scenario where I try to obtain more valuable items.\n      - Let's say I counteroffer [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This means I give Player 1 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. Then I would have 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 8 units of item 5.\n      My value would be (3 * 83) + (5 * 85) + (3 * 76) + (1 * 42) + (8 * 76) = 249 + 425 + 228 + 42 + 608 = 1552\n      - Let's say I counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything and give player 1 nothing. My value is (4 * 83) + (6 * 85) + (3 * 76) + (1 * 42) + (9 * 76) = 332 + 510 + 228 + 42 + 684 = 1796\n\n   - Discounted values: Accepting the current offer now (608) is better than my outside option. If I propose a counteroffer, and it's accepted next round, the discounted value is 0.9 * value of offer. Thus, my target in terms of outcome has to be higher than 608 / .9 = 675 to justify counteroffering.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer of 608 is higher than my outside offer of 374, I should not walk away. Also, since it is round 2, I need to factor in the time discount. If I make a counteroffer, the highest I can possibly get is 1796, and it will be discounted by 0.9. So 1796 * .9 = 1616.4. Now to decide if I make an offer, or accept the current one, I need to figure out what player 1 wants. Looking at the history, player 1 has been very stubborn on item 3 and item 5. Perhaps they value item 3 and item 5 highly. The current offer gives me the highest units of items that I value, and is above my outside offer. So it seems smart to accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1174. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1023 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 1174\n*   Item values: Item 1 = 96, Item 2 = 84, Item 3 = 69, Item 4 = 37, Item 5 = 55\n*   Total items: 9 units of Item 1, 5 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 4 units of Item 4, 1 units of Item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of Item 1: 1 * 96 = 96\n    *   1 unit of Item 2: 1 * 84 = 84\n    *   2 units of Item 3: 2 * 69 = 138\n    *   1 unit of Item 4: 1 * 37 = 37\n    *   1 unit of Item 5: 1 * 55 = 55\n    *   Total value of current offer: 96 + 84 + 138 + 37 + 55 = 410\n\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer (410) is significantly lower than my outside offer (1174).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that could give me a value greater than my outside offer, taking into account the discount factor. If I make a counteroffer, it will be round 2, so my value will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. Therefore, I should aim to get at least 1174/0.9 = 1304.44 value in round 2.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I get a larger share of the valuable items:\n\nCounteroffer: offer Player 1 a small amount and keep the rest.\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 0] to Player 1:\nI get [8, 4, 2, 3, 1]:\n8 * 96 + 4 * 84 + 2 * 69 + 3 * 37 + 1 * 55 = 768 + 336 + 138 + 111 + 55 = 1408\n\n1408 * 0.9 = 1267.2\nthis is still higher than 1174\n\nCounteroffer: offer Player 1 a very small amount and keep the rest.\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1:\nI get [9, 5, 2, 4, 1]:\n9 * 96 + 5 * 84 + 2 * 69 + 4 * 37 + 1 * 55 = 864 + 420 + 138 + 148 + 55 = 1625\n1625 * 0.9 = 1462.5\nthis is higher than 1174\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable. I can do better by making a counteroffer. A counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] gives a higher final value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 is offering me all of item 1 and item 2.\n\n*   I want to make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a good deal (better than their outside offer) but also maximizes my return.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 417.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 47, item 2 = 12, item 3 = 77, item 4 = 40, item 5 = 8.\n*   The total pool of items is: 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that any deal I make in a later round will be worth less than a deal I make now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of this offer to me: (0 \\* 47) + (0 \\* 12) + (1 \\* 77) + (1 \\* 40) + (0 \\* 8) = 0 + 0 + 77 + 40 + 0 = 117.\n    *   Since 117 is significantly less than my outside offer of 417, I should not accept this offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept and that would give me a value greater than 417. I have to offer Player 1 items. Given the limited amount of turns remaining I need to find a potentially acceptable solution now. Item 3 is the most valuable per unit, so giving that to player 1 is unfavorable. Next is Item 1 at 47 a unit, then item 4 at 40, then item 2 at 12 and finally Item 5 at 8. Item 5 is my lowest value item.\n\n    *   Offer Player 1 everything except item 3 and give them all of items 1, 2, 4, and 5. This ensures I get to keep my single unit of item 3 valued at 77, while also ensuring I get the rest of item 3 which is worth 77 so the total value I get from item 3 is 77.\n        * I will propose giving them all of Items 1, 2, 4 and 5.\n        * Offer = [3, 5, 0, 4, 6]\n\n        * Value to me of this proposal = 0(47) + 0(12) + 1(77) + 0(40) + 0(8) = 77. This is not larger than 417 and so a better offer is required. I will take my outside offer.\n        * Since I need 417 and my single unit of item 3 gives me 77, I need a 340 total value minimum, but a higher value means they get to keep more. Giving them item 1 will mean I retain 340 and lose 141. Let us consider a more balanced approach.\n\n        * I need to keep item 3. I can give the player 1 items 1, 2, 4 and 5. The value of these items if I retain them = (3 * 47) + (5 * 12) + (4 * 40) + (6 * 8) = 141 + 60 + 160 + 48 = 409.\n        * 409 and 77 = 486 which is my total value of items. So I must give them at least some value to attempt to get them to agree to a division.\n\n        * I will try and create an offer of: [1, 2, 2, 3] to the other player.\n        * My retained items = (2 * 47) + (3 * 12) + (1 * 77) + (2 * 40) + (3 * 8) = 94 + 36 + 77 + 80 + 24 = 311.\n        * This is still not enough value for me, as I have to beat 417 with this offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable. I have decided to walk away and take my outside offer because I failed to create a valid counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means I get 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 98) + (1 * 29) + (1 * 63) + (1 * 66) + (0 * 40) = 0 + 29 + 63 + 66 + 0 = 158.\n    *   This is significantly less than my outside offer of 661.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I want to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 661.\n    Since it is Round 1, accepting anything less than 661 is not ideal.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 158, which is much less than my outside offer of 661.\n*   Therefore, I should not accept the current offer.\n*   Walking away guarantees me 661.\n*   Let's consider a counteroffer. I have: 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\nTotal Value is (4 * 98) + (6 * 29) + (5 * 63) + (5 * 66) + (3 * 40) = 392 + 174 + 315 + 330 + 120 = 1331\n\nI should try to get close to the outside offer. I want to keep as much as possible, so, I will offer a small amount to the other player.\nI will offer the other player 1 unit each of items 2, 3, and 4.\n\nCounteroffer [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]. This leaves me with:\n4 units of item 1 = 392\n5 units of item 2 = 145\n4 units of item 3 = 252\n4 units of item 4 = 264\n3 units of item 5 = 120\nTotal = 392 + 145 + 252 + 264 + 120 = 1173.\nThis value is more than the outside option, so, this is a good offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 10, 0, 5, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 10, 0, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 10, 0, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and in round 3, it is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 10, 0, 5, 0].

I have no insight into what player 1 values the items. The current offer from player 1 gives them the following:\n    *   6 units of item 1\n    *   0 units of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   0 units of item 4\n    *   5 units of item 5\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer, even before discounting, is less than my outside offer. Because of the discount factor in round 2, the discounted value is much less than the outside offer. So, if I cannot get more value than my outside offer by the end of the negotiation I should WALK.\nI will make a counteroffer and ask for more items.\nI will ask for 6 units of item 1, 10 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n\nThe discounted value is 2220 * 0.9 = 1998 which is higher than 1778.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Accepting an offer in a later round means its value will be multiplied by 0.9^(r-1), where r is the round number. This means that the value of a deal decreases as the negotiation continues.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** The current offer on the table is [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means Player 1 is offering me:\n        - 1 unit of item 1\n        - 1 unit of item 2\n        - 0 units of item 3\n        - 0 units of item 4\n        - 0 units of item 5\n     My value for this offer is (1 * 71) + (1 * 97) + (0 * 24) + (0 * 19) + (0 * 78) = 71 + 97 = 168.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep everything for myself, offering Player 1 nothing: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This gives me a value of (1 * 71) + (1 * 97) + (4 * 24) + (1 * 19) + (4 * 78) = 71 + 97 + 96 + 19 + 312 = 595. Since this is greater than my outside offer, I should not walk away.\n\n   - **Comparing to outside offer:** The current offer (168) is significantly lower than my outside offer (514). Therefore, accepting the current offer is not a good choice.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is bad. Walking away would give me 514. I want to see if I can get a better deal than the current one. I will make a counteroffer that favors me.\n   - My total value of all items is 595. To beat my outside option, I need to get at least 514 / 0.9 = 571.11 in value in round 2, and 514 / (0.9*0.9) = 634.7 in value in round 3.\n   - Since I have 595 total, I will make an initial counteroffer that leaves the other player with relatively little value. The other player currently has a value of (1 * 71) + (1 * 97) + (0 * 24) + (0 * 19) + (0 * 78) = 71 + 97 = 168.\n\nLet's offer the other player nothing in return.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 59. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

Accepting the current offer in round 2 yields a value with a discount of 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    *   Value = (0 * 71) + (0 * 97) + (2 * 24) + (0 * 19) + (2 * 78) = 0 + 0 + 48 + 0 + 156 = 204.\n    *   Discounted value (round 2) = 204 * 0.9 = 183.6. This is much less than my outside offer of 514.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to make a counteroffer where I receive more value than my outside offer. Since it is round 2, I need to discount my total value by 0.9.\n\n    *   Let's consider taking all the items for myself. Player 1 would then get [0,0,0,0,0]\n        *   Value = (1 * 71) + (1 * 97) + (4 * 24) + (1 * 19) + (4 * 78) = 71 + 97 + 96 + 19 + 312 = 595.\n        *   Discounted value (round 2) = 595 * 0.9 = 535.5.\n        *   To achieve this, I need to offer Player 1 [0,0,0,0,0].\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 183.6, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 514.\n*   A counteroffer where I take everything will result in a discounted value of 535.5, which is greater than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away would guarantee me 514.\n*   Therefore, I should make a counteroffer that maximizes my share of the items.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 564.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 37, item 2 = 13, item 3 = 51, item 4 = 5, item 5 = 49.\n*   The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. The value of this offer to me is (0 * 37) + (0 * 13) + (0 * 51) + (2 * 5) + (0 * 49) = 10. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 564.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would get if I offered Player 1 a certain amount of items. Let's consider a few scenarios to illustrate:\n\n    *   **Giving Player 1 half of everything:** This would mean offering them [1, 2, 3, 2.5, 1.5]. Since we can only offer whole units, let's round this to [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]. This means I would keep [1, 2, 3, 3, 2]. My value would be (1 * 37) + (2 * 13) + (3 * 51) + (3 * 5) + (2 * 49) = 37 + 26 + 153 + 15 + 98 = 329. This is much less than my outside offer.\n    *   **Giving Player 1 all of items 1 and 2, and half of 3:** This would mean offering them [2, 4, 3, 0, 0]. I would keep [0, 0, 3, 5, 3]. My value would be (0 * 37) + (0 * 13) + (3 * 51) + (5 * 5) + (3 * 49) = 0 + 0 + 153 + 25 + 147 = 325. This is also much less than my outside offer.\n    *   **Give Player 1 quantities such that I receive at least 564:** I need to keep at least that much value for myself. In that case, my total value for goods I keep has to be greater than 564, and I have to calculate based on that. My total potential value from all items is 604.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is terrible (value of 10), and any reasonable split I can think of right now that I can calculate quickly also gives me less than my outside offer (564), I should make a counteroffer that would be more advantageous for me.\n\nConsidering my outside offer and that round 1 is worth more than future rounds, I will make an offer where I give Player 1 a small amount of item 4.\nMy counteroffer is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nIf Player 1 accepts this, I will receive 2 * 37 + 4 * 13 + 6 * 51 + 4 * 5 + 3 * 49 = 74 + 52 + 306 + 20 + 147 = 599\nThis is very close to my total possible value, and Player 1 would still receive 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 18. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 429 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 18\n*   My values for the items: item 1: 20, item 2: 29, item 3: 11, item 4: 12, item 5: 71\n*   Total items: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 90% of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 81% of a deal in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]. This means I receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   0 units of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n\n    My value for this offer is: (1 * 20) + (0 * 29) + (1 * 11) + (1 * 12) + (2 * 71) = 20 + 0 + 11 + 12 + 142 = 185\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 185 to me, which is much greater than my outside offer of 18.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    I need to decide if I should accept the offer, walk away, or make a counteroffer. Given that the current offer gives me a value of 185, I should either accept it or make a counteroffer if I believe I can get more value.\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I get all the items. In this case I give the other player [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My value in this scenario would be:\n    (2 * 20) + (3 * 29) + (1 * 11) + (4 * 12) + (2 * 71) = 40 + 87 + 11 + 48 + 142 = 328\n\n    Given that I only have two rounds left after this one, if I make a counteroffer and it is rejected, the discounted outside value is more likely to be worse than the initial offered value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nSince the current offer is worth significantly more than my outside offer, I should accept it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [3, 0, 0, 4, 4]. This means they are offering me all of item 1, all of item 4, and all of item 5.\n    *   Value to me: (3 * 98) + (0 * 92) + (0 * 24) + (4 * 85) + (4 * 44) = 294 + 0 + 0 + 340 + 176 = 810\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 810 < 1171. Accepting the current offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\nNow, let's consider a potential counteroffer. I want to aim for a value that is significantly higher than my outside offer, considering the discount factor in future rounds.\n\nI currently have nothing of item 2 and item 3 in the current offer. Item 2 is the most valuable per unit (92), followed by item 1 (98), and then item 4 (85).\nLet's evaluate keeping all the item 2 and item 4, and giving all of the remaining of item 1,3, and 5.\nI would offer [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]. Then my value would be:\n6 * 92 + 4 * 85 = 552 + 340 = 892\n\nLet's try to formulate an offer that will get me very close to my outside offer.\nI'll offer [0, 3, 3, 0, 4]. My value would be:\n3*92 + 4*85 = 276 + 340 = 616 + 3*98 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 294+340+276 = 910.\nLet's try this:\nI will counteroffer with [0, 3, 1, 0, 2]. My value will be:\n3 * 92 + 2 * 24 + 2 * 44 + 4 * 85 + 3 * 98 = 276 + 48 + 88 + 340 + 294 = 1046.\n\nConsidering round 1 and the need to reach a mutually beneficial agreement to avoid the discount factor, I'll make a counteroffer that gives me more value than the current offer and my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable. Walking away guarantees 1171.\nA better counteroffer is needed to try and capture more value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 708. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 702 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less to me than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 5, 0, 0]. This means they are offering me 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer: (0 * 14) + (0 * 41) + (5 * 7) + (0 * 61) + (0 * 8) = 0 + 0 + 35 + 0 + 0 = 35\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (35) is much lower than my outside offer (351).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what a good counteroffer might be. I want to maximize my value while considering that Player 1 also needs to get something they value. Since item 4 has the highest value for me (61), I want to try and keep as much of it as possible.\n    * Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 all of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, and nothing of item 3, item 4 or item 5. This means I would offer Player 1 [4, 1, 0, 0, 0]. I keep for myself item holdings [0, 1, 5, 3, 0]. My valuation is (0 * 14) + (1 * 41) + (5 * 7) + (3 * 61) + (0 * 8) = 0 + 41 + 35 + 183 + 0 = 259. This offer is not higher than my walk away value of 351. I need to offer a larger number of items that are worth less to me in exchange for items of higher value to me.\n    * Let's make a counteroffer where I give Player 1 all of items 1 and 3, and keep all of items 2 and 4 for myself. Offer [4,0,5,0,0] = (0 * 14) + (2 * 41) + (0 * 7) + (3 * 61) + (0 * 8) = 0 + 82 + 0 + 183 + 0 = 265\n    * Let's make a counteroffer where I give Player 1 2 of items 1, and 2 of item 3 and keep the rest. Offer [2,0,2,0,0] = (2 * 14) + (2 * 41) + (3 * 7) + (3 * 61) + (0 * 8) = 28 + 82 + 21 + 183 + 0 = 314\n    * Let's make a counteroffer where I give Player 1 1 of items 1, and 3 of item 3 and keep the rest.

Offer [1,0,4,0,0] = (3 * 14) + (2 * 41) + (1 * 7) + (3 * 61) + (0 * 8) = 42 + 82 + 7 + 183 + 0 = 314\n    * I will offer [0,0,0,1,0]. This leaves me with [4,2,5,2,0] and a total of 4*14+2*41+5*7+2*61+0*8 = 56+82+35+122 = 295\n    * Let's try offer [0,0,0,0,0] which would leave me with [4,2,5,3,0]. This has value 4*14+2*41+5*7+3*61 = 56+82+35+183 = 356, this is marginally above my walkaway, but likely not enough to get them to accept the counteroffer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is very bad, I should not accept. My best strategy is to make a reasonable counteroffer and hope Player 1 accepts. Given that the current offer is 5 units of item 3, which I value at 7, then I will make a counteroffer that takes one unit of item 4 and give them one unit of item 3 in return. This is a low risk offer, which will either be accepted or allow me to walk next round with a better understanding of the value of Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 1, 0]}\n```",

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its actual value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its actual value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 5, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value for this offer is (0 * 14) + (0 * 41) + (5 * 7) + (0 * 61) + (0 * 8) = 35. This offer is worth 35 * 0.9 = 31.5 in this round.\n   - Outside offer: My outside offer is worth 351.\n\n3) **Potential Counteroffers:**\n   Since Player 1 seems to value item 3 highly, I will try and trade item 4 which I value highly but Player 1 does not.\n\n    Consider offering the other player 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4 and 0 units of item 5.\n    I would keep 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5.\n    4 units of item 1 = 4 * 14 = 56\n    0 units of item 2 = 0 * 41 = 0\n    0 units of item 3 = 0 * 7 = 0\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 * 61 = 183\n    0 units of item 5 = 0 * 8 = 0\n    Total Value = 56 + 0 + 0 + 183 + 0 = 239.\n\nConsider offering the other player 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 3 unit of item 4 and 0 units of item 5.\n    I would keep 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5.\n    4 units of item 1 = 4 * 14 = 56\n    2 units of item 2 = 2 * 41 = 82\n    5 units of item 3 = 5 * 7 = 35\n    0 units of item 4 = 0 * 61 = 0\n    0 units of item 5 = 0 * 8 = 0\n    Total Value = 56 + 82 + 35 + 0 + 0 = 173.\n\nLet's try and get some item 4 from Player 1.\n\nI will offer Player 1 the following:\n\n[4, 2, 0, 0, 0] - I will take all of the item 3 (value 35).\n\nMy value: 35 * 0.9 = 31.5 vs 351 (outside offer).\n\nMy offer of [0, 0, 0, 3, 0] to player 1 results in me having the other items.\nMy value: 4 * 14 + 2 * 41 + 5 * 7 = 56 + 82 + 35 = 173.\nI am still not getting close to the outside offer.\n\nI will make a counteroffer to Player 1 offering them 0 item 1, 0 item 2, 0 item 3, 0 item 4, and 0 item 5.\n\n4) **Decision:**\n   Accepting the current offer is worth 31.5, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 351. It's round 2, so I need to decide if making an offer is better than just walking away and getting 351. It seems unlikely I am able to make a beneficial counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Since we are in round 2, accepting an offer now means the value is multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 5, 0], which means I receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  My value for this is (0 * 47) + (0 * 80) + (0 * 57) + (5 * 46) + (0 * 36) = 230.  The discounted value is 230 * 0.9 = 207.\n   - This value (207) is much lower than my outside offer value of 531.\n   - Now, let's consider a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I want to keep the items I value highly. Since Player 1 wants all the item 4s, maybe I can offer some of them in exchange for keeping all of the item 2s, and some of item 3.  I should also propose giving Player 1 all of item 1 and item 5, since these are less valuable to me.\n   Let's try an offer where I give Player 1 all of items 1, 4, and 5. This means I offer [2, 0, 0, 5, 3].\n   My value for this is (0 * 47) + (2 * 80) + (3 * 57) + (0 * 46) + (0 * 36) = 0 + 160 + 171 + 0 + 0 = 331. The discounted value is 331 * 0.9 = 297.9.  This is still less than 531.\n   Let's make a counteroffer that gives up item 1 (2), item 4 (0), and item 5 (0).\n    This results in my getting 2 item 2's (2 * 80 = 160), 3 item 3's (3 * 57 = 171), 0 item 4's, and 0 item 1's. My value is 160 + 171 = 331 * 0.9 = 297.9.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n   - Making a counteroffer and hoping it gets accepted in the next round seems risky, since my offer has to increase my value enough to be better than the outside offer once discounted.\n   - Walking away guarantees my outside offer value.\n\nTherefore, I will walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 661. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 465 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's break down this negotiation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 661.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1: 67, item 2: 7, item 3: 10, item 4: 43, item 5: 28.\n*   The total pool of items is: 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means accepting an offer in round 2 gives me 0.9 * value, and in round 3, 0.81 * value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [4, 0, 0, 0, 3] which means Player 1 is offering me 4 units of item 1 and 3 units of item 5. This is worth:\n    *   4 * 67 (item 1) + 3 * 28 (item 5) = 268 + 84 = 352\n    *   Therefore, accepting the current offer gives me a value of 352.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is 661. 352 is significantly lower than 661.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate the value of some potential counteroffers, keeping in mind I want to maximize my value. I have 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5 in total. Player 1 is offering me 4 units of item 1 and 3 units of item 5. This means that I would give Player 1 the rest.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer (352) is much worse than walking away (661).\n*   I will make a counteroffer. Since I am giving to Player 1, I need to calculate what I will give them. They offered to give me [4, 0, 0, 0, 3]. This means Player 1 is asking for:\n    *   2 units of item 1\n    *   4 units of item 2\n    *   4 units of item 3\n    *   3 units of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n\nI should make a counteroffer that is closer to my outside option. I need to give player 1 as little as possible while still being reasonable. I will try to give them:\n*   1 unit of item 1\n*   3 units of item 2\n*   3 units of item 3\n*   2 unit of item 4\n*   1 unit of item 5\nThis makes my offer [1, 3, 3, 2, 1].\nThen, I get:\n*   5 units of item 1 = 5*67 = 335\n*   1 units of item 2 = 1*7 = 7\n*   1 units of item 3 = 1*10 = 10\n*   1 units of item 4 = 1*43 = 43\n*   4 units of item 5 = 4*28 = 112\nValue = 335 + 7 + 10 + 43 + 112 = 507. I need to make an offer closer to my outside option.\n\nI will try to give them:\n*   0 unit of item 1\n*   0 units of item 2\n*   0 units of item 3\n*   0 unit of item 4\n*   0 unit of item 5\nThis makes my offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThen, I get:\n*   6 units of item 1 = 6*67 = 402\n*   4 units of item 2 = 4*7 = 28\n*   4 units of item 3 = 4*10 = 40\n*   3 units of item 4 = 3*43 = 129\n*   5 units of item 5 = 5*28 = 140\nValue = 402 + 28 + 40 + 129 + 140 = 739\n\nThis would mean my counteroffer to Player 1 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best course of action.\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n   - My outside offer value: 1125\n   - Values of the items: item 1: 91, item 2: 79, item 3: 47, item 4: 98, item 5: 81\n   - Total pool of items: 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal made in later rounds is worth less than a deal made now. Specifically, a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the items, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value of the items.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - Current offer: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] (what I receive). This means Player 1 gets:\n      - Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n      - Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3\n      - Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1\n      - Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n      - Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n   - Value of current offer to me:\n      - 1 * 91 + 2 * 79 + 1 * 47 + 2 * 98 + 1 * 81 = 91 + 158 + 47 + 196 + 81 = 573\n   - Value of current offer * discount factor (0.9^(1-1) = 1): 573\n\n   - Consider a potential counteroffer where I give Player 1 half of the items (rounded as needed, since you can't have half a unit). This would mean I keep:\n       - Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n       - Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3\n       - Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1\n       - Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n       - Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n      Which has value (2*91 + 3*79 + 1*47 + 3*98 + 2*81) = 182 + 237 + 47 + 294 + 162 = 922.\n   - Consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep all the items.\n      This has a value of 3*91 + 5*79 + 2*47 + 5*98 + 3*81 = 273 + 395 + 94 + 490 + 243 = 1495.\n   - Consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1: [3, 5, 2, 5, 3]. This means I keep nothing.\n      This has a value of 0.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n   - The current offer gives me a value of 573, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 1125.\n   - The total possible value is 1495.\n\nSince the current offer is far below my outside offer, I should not accept it. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to what I want, while still being reasonable enough for Player 1 to consider. I will offer Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. That means I keep items [3, 4, 2, 4, 3].\nMy payoff is 3*91 + 4*79 + 2*47 + 4*98 + 3*81 = 273 + 316 + 94 + 392 + 243 = 1318.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 483. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 783 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] (This is what Player 1 is offering *me*). This means Player 1 gets: [0, 2, 7, 3, 3].\n    *   My value for the current offer: (0 * 81) + (1 * 76) + (1 * 18) + (1 * 72) + (1 * 61) = 0 + 76 + 18 + 72 + 61 = 227\n\n*   How does this compare to my outside offer? 227 > 130. So accepting the current offer is better than walking away *right now*.\n\n*   Consider a possible counteroffer. I want to keep as much of the valuable items (2, 4, and 5) as possible.\n\n    *   I need to consider the possibility of getting nothing in later rounds. If I reject this offer, Player 1 might walk away, or make a much worse offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince 227 > 130, accepting is better than walking away *immediately*. However, I will try to get an even better deal. I could offer Player 1 more of the less valuable item 3 to retain more of item 2, 4 and 5. Let's test a slightly modified offer:\nIf I offer player 1 the following: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nThen I get [0, 3, 6, 4, 4]\nMy value would be: (3 * 76) + (6 * 18) + (4 * 72) + (4 * 61) = 228 + 108 + 288 + 244 = 868\nThis is a significantly better outcome for me.\n\nAnother possible counteroffer:\nOffer Player 1: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\nThen I get [0, 3, 2, 4, 4]\nMy value would be: (3 * 76) + (2 * 18) + (4 * 72) + (4 * 61) = 228 + 36 + 288 + 244 = 796\n\nGiven that my outside offer is 130, and the current offer gives me a value of 227, I'll try to push for a slightly better deal. I'll offer more of item 3 (the least valuable to me) in exchange for keeping more of items 2, 4, and 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means I get 0 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value if I accept: (0 \\* 66) + (5 \\* 54) + (0 \\* 8) + (0 \\* 80) + (0 \\* 27) = 0 + 270 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 270\n*   **Comparing to outside offer:** 270 < 491. Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\nNow let's consider a potential counteroffer. I want to maximize my value while making it appealing enough for Player 1 to accept. Let's aim for a value slightly higher than my outside offer, say around 500-600.\n\nI want to keep the items I value most, which are items 1 and 4.

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [1, 0, 0, 0, 3] to *me*. This means I get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 18 = 18\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 48 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 94 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 36 = 0\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 36 = 108\n    *   Total value of current offer: 18 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 108 = 126\n\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer's value (126) is slightly greater than my outside offer value (124).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to decide if I should make a counteroffer. I currently have:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   3 units of item 2\n    *   3 units of item 3\n    *   4 units of item 4\n    *   4 units of item 5\n\n    The remaining items are:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   3 units of item 2\n    *   3 units of item 3\n    *   4 units of item 4\n    *   4 units of item 5\n\n    Let's consider giving player 1 0 of item 1, all of item 2 (3 units), all of item 3 (3 units), 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. That's [0, 3, 3, 0, 0] for them.\n    That would leave me with all of item 1 (1 unit), 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, all of item 4 (4 units), and all of item 5 (7 units). My value would be:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 18 = 18\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 48 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 94 = 0\n    *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 36 = 144\n    *   7 units of item 5: 7 * 36 = 252\n    *   Total value: 18 + 0 + 0 + 144 + 252 = 414\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is only slightly better than my outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1085\n*   **Values of the items:** Item 1: 12, Item 2: 69, Item 3: 74, Item 4: 67, Item 5: 72\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 7, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer later is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This means I receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 12 = 12\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 69 = 69\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 74 = 74\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 67 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 72 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 12 + 69 + 74 + 0 + 0 = 155\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (155) is significantly lower than my outside offer (1085).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**  I need to find a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept and that gives me a value greater than 1085. Since this is round 1, there's room for negotiation. I want to keep the majority of the valuable items 3, 5, 4 and 2 and give Player 1 the majority of Item 1, which I value the least. Let's try offering Player 1 3 units of Item 1, 2 of Item 2 and nothing of the others.\n    *   Offering Player 1 [3, 2, 0, 0, 0] means I keep:\n        *   Item 1: 4 - 3 = 1 unit: 1 * 12 = 12\n        *   Item 2: 6 - 2 = 4 units: 4 * 69 = 276\n        *   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3 units: 3 * 74 = 222\n        *   Item 4: 7 - 0 = 7 units: 7 * 67 = 469\n        *   Item 5: 4 - 0 = 4 units: 4 * 72 = 288\n        *   Total value of this counteroffer to me: 12 + 276 + 222 + 469 + 288 = 1267\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is much worse than my outside offer.  The counteroffer I calculated yields a value of 1267, which is greater than 1085. This is a good start, but I can test to see if Player 1 is really attached to Item 1.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Since this is round 2, I can propose a counteroffer, but if player 1 rejects it, then in round 3 my counteroffer is treated as a WALK. Therefore, this round is essentially my final offer, but I would get the discounted value. Let's try to construct a counteroffer that leaves me with a slightly higher value than my walk away, while still leaving Player 1 a worthwhile offer, such that player 1 is likely to accept.\n    * I need a value of 1085 / 0.9 = 1205.56 in this round.\n\n    * Let's consider giving Player 1 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5, and keeping the rest.

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 66) + (0 * 39) + (0 * 53) + (0 * 93) + (1 * 73) = 73\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 73 * 0.9 = 65.7\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's discounted value (65.7) is significantly less than my outside offer (1264).\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to offer Player 1 some combination of items, keeping the rest for myself. Let's think about potential counteroffers. Since it's round 2, I need to make a reasonable offer or Player 1 may walk in round 3. Let's consider keeping all of item 4, which I value highly (93 per unit), and most of Item 5.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. I'm much better off with my outside offer. I should try to make a counteroffer that's beneficial to both of us to avoid walking.\n\nLet's try offering the other player 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4 and 5 unit of item 5.\nThat means I keep 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 4 units of item 5.\nValue to me: (2*66) + (4*39) + (4*53) + (3*93) + (4*73) = 132 + 156 + 212 + 279 + 292 = 1071\nDiscounted value: 1071 * 0.9 = 963.9\n\nLet's try offering a counteroffer to Player 1: 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4 and 5 unit of item 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 2, 0, 5]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 490\n*   **Values of the items:** Item 1: 92, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 1, Item 4: 91, Item 5: 54\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]. This means I get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 92 = 92\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 2 = 6\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 1 = 1\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 91 = 91\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 54 = 54\n    *   Total value: 92 + 6 + 1 + 91 + 54 = 244\n\n    This is much lower than my outside offer of 490.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find a division that gives me a value greater than 490. Since it is the first round, I will aim to find something far beyond my outside offer. Let's calculate my maximum possible value, which is 783. Player 1 offered me 244, so if I offer them nothing, I will receive:\n    *   4 units of item 1: 4 * 92 = 368\n    *   6 units of item 2: 6 * 2 = 12\n    *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 1 = 5\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 91 = 182\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 54 = 216\n    *   Total value: 368 + 12 + 5 + 182 + 216 = 783\n\n    If I offer the other player [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], I get the maximum value of 783.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer of 244 is much less than my outside offer of 490, I should not accept. I will make a counteroffer that favors me. If I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], I will receive 783. Let's propose a more reasonable counteroffer.\n* Items available: item 1 (4), item 2 (6), item 3 (5), item 4 (2), item 5 (4)\n* My values: 92, 2, 1, 91, 54\nI value items 1 and 4 highly. Let's offer Player 1 half of items 2, 3, and 5 and none of items 1 and 4:\n\nOffering Player 1 [0, 3, 2, 0, 2] means I get:\n* item 1: 4 * 92 = 368\n* item 2: 3 * 2 = 6\n* item 3: 3 * 1 = 3\n* item 4: 2 * 91 = 182\n* item 5: 2 * 54 = 108\nTotal = 368 + 6 + 3 + 182 + 108 = 667\n\nThis is still greater than my outside offer of 490, and is more reasonable than [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 2, 0, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 889. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 792 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "My reasoning:\n1. My outside offer is 889. My private item values are: item1 = 89, item2 = 25, item3 = 75, item4 = 50, item5 = 25. The total pool is: 5, 6, 3, 2, and 4 units respectively (total value 1020 if I got all). In round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(0)=1, so any deal today is not discounted.\n2. To beat my outside offer, I need to secure at least 889 value from my share. If I take all items, I get 1020. Thus I can afford to give away up to 1020 \u2013 889 = 131 (in my valuation) to Player 2.\n3. I want to keep the items that are highly valuable to me (especially item1 at 89 per unit and item3 at 75 per unit) while conceding items with lower value per unit. For instance, item2 and item5, each valued at 25, are less \u201ccostly\u201d for me to concede. One simple idea was to offer Player 2 all of item5, which amounts to a loss of 4\u00d725 = 100, leaving me with a value of 920. However, such an offer might be too stingy and might not entice Player 2.\n4. By adjusting slightly, I can add a small concession in item2. For example, if I offer Player 2 1 unit of item2 (worth 25 for me) plus all 4 units of item5 (worth 100 for me), my \u201closs\u201d is 125 and my remaining value is 1020 \u2013 125 = 895, which is safely above my outside offer value of 889.\n5. This division (offering [0,1,0,0,4] to Player 2) gives me a high value (895) while also potentially providing Player 2 enough to consider accepting the deal.\n\nTherefore, my chosen action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0,1,0,0,4]}",

In other words, give them nothing.\nValue to player 2:\n5 * 25 + 6 * 9 + 3 * 26 + 2 * 90 + 4 * 58 = 125 + 54 + 78 + 180 + 232 = 669\nScaled: 669 * 0.9 = 602.1 which is > 466.\n\nNow, let's consider offering something in the middle: offer player 1 a little of everything:\nOffer [1,1,1,1,1] to Player 1\nPlayer 2's value:\nItem 1: (5-1) * 25 = 100\nItem 2: (6-1) * 9 = 45\nItem 3: (3-1) * 26 = 52\nItem 4: (2-1) * 90 = 90\nItem 5: (4-1) * 58 = 174\nTotal: 100 + 45 + 52 + 90 + 174 = 461.\nScaled to this round: 461 * 0.9 = 414.9\n\nNow let me offer something higher to player 1, such that it is a win/win:\nOffer [2,2,2,1,2] to Player 1\nPlayer 2's value:\nItem 1: (5-2) * 25 = 75\nItem 2: (6-2) * 9 = 36\nItem 3: (3-2) * 26 = 26\nItem 4: (2-1) * 90 = 90\nItem 5: (4-2) * 58 = 116\nTotal: 75 + 36 + 26 + 90 + 116 = 343.\nScaled to this round: 343 * 0.9 = 308.7\n\nI am going to offer the other player almost everything and see if they bite:\n[4,5,2,1,3]\nPlayer 2 gets\nItem 1: (5-4) * 25 = 25\nItem 2: (6-5) * 9 = 9\nItem 3: (3-2) * 26 = 26\nItem 4: (2-1) * 90 = 90\nItem 5: (4-3) * 58 = 58\nTotal: 25 + 9 + 26 + 90 + 58 = 208\nScaled: 208 * 0.9 = 187.2\nIn round 3 that would be: 208 * 0.81 = 168.48\nThat is significantly less than my outside offer.\n\nMy best option would be to counteroffer [0,0,0,0,0]\nThat values me at: 602.1 this round, which is above my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nThe current offer is terrible. I can certainly do better.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 1327\n*   Item values: item 1 = 61, item 2 = 22, item 3 = 49, item 4 = 71, item 5 = 100\n*   Total items: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This means I receive:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 61 = 122\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 22 = 22\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 49 = 49\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 71 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 100 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 122 + 22 + 49 + 0 + 0 = 193\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (193) is significantly less than my outside offer (1327).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to maximize my value while considering Player 1 will also want a good deal. Let's calculate the total value of all items to me:\n    *   3 * 61 + 3 * 22 + 2 * 49 + 5 * 71 + 8 * 100 = 183 + 66 + 98 + 355 + 800 = 1502\n\n    Since the current offer is so low, I should make a counteroffer. I need to offer Player 1 enough to make it worthwhile for them while still getting more than my outside offer value. If I offered Player 1 half of the items and kept half, my value would be 1502 / 2 = 751. Since this is less than the outside value, let's propose keeping most of item 5 and 4.\n    \n    To offer more than my outside offer, I'd need to hold a value above 1327. Let's offer Player 1: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]. This means they get:\n    *   1 units of item 1: 1 * 61 = 61\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 22 = 44\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 49 = 49\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 71 = 142\n    *   1 units of item 5: 1 * 100 = 100\n    *   Total value of this offer to player 1: 61 + 44 + 49 + 142 + 100 = 396\n\n    In this counteroffer, I receive:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 61 = 122\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 22 = 22\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 49 = 49\n    *   3 unit of item 4: 3 * 71 = 213\n    *   7 units of item 5: 7 * 100 = 700\n    *   Total value of this for me: 122 + 22 + 49 + 213 + 700 = 1106.\n\n    Let's try another offer. Let's try [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. In this case, my offer value would be the max. This is not a great offer to player 1. Let's try giving player 1 some of item 5. Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 2].\n    *   Player 1 gets value of 2 * 100 = 200\n    *   I get value of 3 * 61 + 3 * 22 + 2 * 49 + 5 * 71 + 6 * 100 = 183 + 66 + 98 + 355 + 600 = 1302\n\n    Let's give player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. Player 1 gets 100, I get 1402.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. I should make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a reasonable amount while ensuring I get more than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 657\n*   My item values: item 1 = 67, item 2 = 27, item 3 = 9, item 4 = 80, item 5 = 84\n*   Total pool of items: 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: I am being offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get nothing, and Player 1 gets everything.\n    *   My total value if I accept: 0 * 67 + 0 * 27 + 0 * 9 + 0 * 80 + 0 * 84 = 0\n    *   This is significantly less than my outside offer of 657.\n*   Potential counteroffers: Let's consider a few counteroffers.\n    *   If I offer Player 1 nothing [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] that means I get all the items: 1 * 67 + 4 * 27 + 3 * 9 + 6 * 80 + 4 * 84 = 67 + 108 + 27 + 480 + 336 = 1018\n    *   If I offer Player 1 half of each item (where possible), it would be difficult since the item units are not all even.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 0, which is far less than my outside option.\n*   Walking away gives me a value of 657.\n*   Making a counteroffer that is even moderately favorable to me would give me a value significantly higher than my outside option.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer. I will offer player 1 a small amount and see how they respond.\nLet's offer Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This means I get 1 item 1, 3 items 2, 3 items 3, 5 items 4, 4 items 5.\n\nMy value would be: 1*67 + 3*27 + 3*9 + 5*80 + 4*84 = 67 + 81 + 27 + 400 + 336 = 911\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This means I receive:\n    *   1 unit of Item 1: 1 * 44 = 44\n    *   1 unit of Item 2: 1 * 84 = 84\n    *   0 units of Item 3: 0 * 74 = 0\n    *   1 unit of Item 4: 1 * 70 = 70\n    *   0 units of Item 5: 0 * 28 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 44 + 84 + 0 + 70 + 0 = 198\n*   **Compare to Outside Offer:** 198 is significantly less than my outside offer of 946. Therefore, accepting the current offer is not a good idea.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would get if I propose a counteroffer. Player 1 currently has:\n    * Item 1: 1\n    * Item 2: 1\n    * Item 3: 1\n    * Item 4: 1\n    * Item 5: 4\n\n    This leaves me with:\n    * Item 1: 3\n    * Item 2: 2\n    * Item 3: 0\n    * Item 4: 4\n    * Item 5: 0\n\n    Value of current item split to me:\n    * Item 1: 3 * 44 = 132\n    * Item 2: 2 * 84 = 168\n    * Item 3: 0 * 74 = 0\n    * Item 4: 4 * 70 = 280\n    * Item 5: 4 * 28 = 112\n    Total value = 692\n\n    Therefore Player 1's value is\n    * Item 1: 1 * 44 = 44\n    * Item 2: 1 * 84 = 84\n    * Item 3: 1 * 74 = 74\n    * Item 4: 1 * 70 = 70\n    * Item 5: 0 * 28 = 0\n    Total value = 272\n\n    **Counteroffer example:** I should aim for a counteroffer that gives me at least my outside option value while giving Player 1 enough to prefer it over their outside option. I will start by proposing to keep most of the higher valued items (2 and 4), giving Player 1 more of items 1, 3, and 5. I will calculate my value if I were to offer the player the following: [2, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n    * Item 1: 2 * 44 = 88\n    * Item 2: 0 * 84 = 0\n    * Item 3: 1 * 74 = 74\n    * Item 4: 0 * 70 = 0\n    * Item 5: 2 * 28 = 56\n    Total value = 218\n\n    This leaves me with:\n    * Item 1: 2 * 44 = 88\n    * Item 2: 3 * 84 = 252\n    * Item 3: 0 * 74 = 0\n    * Item 4: 5 * 70 = 350\n    * Item 5: 2 * 28 = 56\n    Total value = 746\n\n    This is still less than my outside offer. I will try a different approach. Let's focus on a counteroffer that is closer to an equal split of value, giving me at least 946 * .9 in expected value.\n\n    Let's try the counteroffer [1, 1, 0, 2, 1]. Then I keep [3, 2, 1, 3, 3].\n    My value for the keep: 3*44 + 2*84 + 1*74 + 3*70 + 3*28 = 132 + 168 + 74 + 210 + 84 = 668\n    My value for the offer: 1*44 + 1*84 + 0*74 + 2*70 + 1*28 = 44 + 84 + 0 + 140 + 28 = 296\n\n    Since 668 is still far from my outside offer, I will offer to give much of the items.\n    Let's try [3, 2, 1, 4, 3]. Then I keep [1, 1, 0, 1, 1].\n    My value for the keep: 1*44 + 1*84 + 0*74 + 1*70 + 1*28 = 44 + 84 + 0 + 70 + 28 = 226\n    My value for the offer: 3*44 + 2*84 + 1*74 + 4*70 + 3*28 = 132 + 168 + 74 + 280 + 84 = 738\n\n    Since this still doesn't cut it, and given I have to make a decision, I will offer more items, which leaves me with very little.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince it is round 1, I will attempt a counteroffer, hoping Player 1 will accept it in the next round. Because I need the total to be over 946, I need to offer enough to make it worthwhile for Player 1.\nI am going to offer [2, 1, 1, 2, 2] to Player 1.\n\nMy value for the keep: 2*44 + 2*84 + 0*74 + 3*70 + 2*28 = 88 + 168 + 0 + 210 + 56 = 522\nMy value for the offer: 2*44 + 1*84 + 1*74 + 2*70 + 2*28 = 88 + 84 + 74 + 140 + 56 = 442\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 606\n   - My item values: item 1 = 36, item 2 = 9, item 3 = 38, item 4 = 58, item 5 = 40\n   - Total items: 4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 4 of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and in round 3, it is worth 81%. This encourages making a deal sooner rather than later, but not at the cost of a large value loss.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: I receive [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]. This means Player 1 receives [3, 2, 3, 2, 3] respectively.\n     - My value for the current offer: (1 * 36) + (2 * 9) + (1 * 38) + (1 * 58) + (1 * 40) = 36 + 18 + 38 + 58 + 40 = 190\n     - Discounted value: 190 * (0.9^(1-1)) = 190. Since 190 is less than my outside offer value of 606, this is not a good offer.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to find an offer that is better than 606. Let's evaluate a few options.\n     - I keep everything: My total value = (4 * 36) + (4 * 9) + (4 * 38) + (3 * 58) + (4 * 40) = 144 + 36 + 152 + 174 + 160 = 666. If I give Player 1 nothing, then Player 1 might WALK.\n     - Give Player 1 one unit of each item. My offer is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].  My value would be (3 * 36) + (3 * 9) + (3 * 38) + (2 * 58) + (3 * 40) = 108 + 27 + 114 + 116 + 120 = 485.  This is not better than my outside offer even with a discount factor of 1.\n     - I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My value = 666.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n   - If I offer Player 1 nothing, I get 666, which is better than my outside offer.\n   - If I offer Player 1 something more reasonable to avoid a WALK, I would get less than my outside offer.\n\nI will make a counteroffer that gives player 1 a small amount. Player 1 is offering me one unit of items 1, 3, 4, and 5 which are my most valued. Player 1 is also offering me 2 units of item 2 which is my least valued. Therefore, I will offer Player 1 one unit of the items that I least value: items 1, 2, and 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 606\n   - My item values: item 1 = 36, item 2 = 9, item 3 = 38, item 4 = 58, item 5 = 40\n   - Total items: 4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: 0.9.  This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 would be worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer:** I am offered [0, 4, 0, 3, 0]. This means I get:\n      - 0 units of item 1 = 0 * 36 = 0\n      - 4 units of item 2 = 4 * 9 = 36\n      - 0 units of item 3 = 0 * 38 = 0\n      - 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 58 = 174\n      - 0 units of item 5 = 0 * 40 = 0\n      - Total value = 0 + 36 + 0 + 174 + 0 = 210.\n      - Discounted value = 210 * 0.9 = 189.\n\n   - **Previous Round's Offer to me:** I was offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1] in the prior round. That means I would have received:\n        - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 36 = 36\n        - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 9 = 9\n        - 0 units of item 3 = 0 * 38 = 0\n        - 0 units of item 4 = 0 * 58 = 0\n        - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 40 = 40\n        - Total Value = 36 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 40 = 85\n        - Discounted value = 85 * 1 = 85\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n      - Let's consider a counteroffer where I get close to my outside offer. I need a total value around 606 / 0.9 = 673.33 to be equivalent to my outside offer.  The remaining goods for Player 1 would need to leave them something that they would value given they have already countered twice. Since I only have one round remaining to make an agreement, I will make an aggressive counteroffer close to my walk away to see if they accept.\n\n      - Counteroffer: [4, 4, 4, 3, 4] to Player 1. This means I keep:\n         - 0 units of item 1 = 0 * 36 = 0\n         - 0 units of item 2 = 0 * 9 = 0\n         - 0 units of item 3 = 0 * 38 = 0\n         - 0 units of item 4 = 0 * 58 = 0\n         - 0 units of item 5 = 0 * 40 = 0\n         - Total value = 0. Discounted value = 0 * 0.9 = 0. This is significantly less than my walk away offer, and the counteroffer is just a walk away in disguise.\n\n      - Since I have already lost value from the previous round, and now I have an offer worth 189, I need to consider other combinations of the total item units, keeping in mind that any offer will be discounted by 0.9.\n      - I will now attempt to make an offer to give away as little as possible to Player 1, while still leaving enough on the table to receive more than my outside offer.\n\n      - Counteroffer: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1. This means I keep:\n         - 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 36 = 108\n         - 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 9 = 27\n         - 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 38 = 114\n         - 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 58 = 116\n         - 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 40 = 120\n         - Total value = 108 + 27 + 114 + 116 + 120 = 485\n         - Discounted Value = 485 * 0.9 = 436.5. This is still less than my walk away offer.\n\n      - Counteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1. This means I keep:\n         - 4 units of item 1 = 4 * 36 = 144\n         - 4 units of item 2 = 4 * 9 = 36\n         - 4 units of item 3 = 4 * 38 = 152\n         - 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 58 = 174\n         - 4 units of item 5 = 4 * 40 = 160\n         - Total value = 144 + 36 + 152 + 174 + 160 = 666\n         - Discounted Value = 666 * 0.9 = 599.4. This is still less than my walk away offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is only worth 189, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 606. All analyzed possible counteroffers would give less than my walk away value. Therefore, I should WALK away and take my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 9, 3, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 9 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of this offer: (0 * 21) + (9 * 67) + (3 * 36) + (0 * 3) + (0 * 37) = 0 + 603 + 108 + 0 + 0 = 711.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 711 > 678. So, the current offer is better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** It's worth exploring if I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer. Since my values for items 2 and 3 are high, and the current offer gives me all of item 2 and all of item 3, I likely will not be able to improve over the current offer. I am very low on item 4, so giving some of that away to get more of something else is not attractive. Item 5 is moderately valuable, and I don't receive any now. Item 1 is also moderately valuable and I don't receive any now.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is better than my outside offer. Therefore, I should accept it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 425\n   - Item values: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 5, item 3 = 32, item 4 = 61, item 5 = 63\n   - Total items: 2 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer later is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 3, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1 and 3 units of item 2. My value would be:\n      (1 * 4) + (3 * 5) + (0 * 32) + (0 * 61) + (0 * 63) = 4 + 15 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 19.\n   - This value (19) is significantly lower than my outside offer (425).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find a division of items that gives me a value greater than 425. The total value of all the items to me is (2 * 4) + (6 * 5) + (5 * 32) + (2 * 61) + (3 * 63) = 8 + 30 + 160 + 122 + 189 = 509.  Since I get 19 from the current offer to me, Player 1 gets 509 - 19 = 490 in value.\n   If I offer Player 1 nothing, I get the full 509.\n\n   - How to find the optimal counteroffer: There is no simple way to determine the optimal counteroffer without knowing player 1's value. However, because Player 1's offer is low, it is better to make an offer that is closer to even, in order to get closer to my optimal value.\n\n    Here are the items that will stay with me if Player 1 accepts my counteroffer:\n\n        Item 1: 2 - x1\n        Item 2: 6 - x2\n        Item 3: 5 - x3\n        Item 4: 2 - x4\n        Item 5: 3 - x5\n\n    So the value to me of the counteroffer will be:\n\n        4 * (2 - x1) + 5 * (6 - x2) + 32 * (5 - x3) + 61 * (2 - x4) + 63 * (3 - x5)\n\n    Let's consider offering Player 1 half the total value, or as close as we can get. Let's try to make an offer where I get a total value of around 250.\n\n    Given Player 1's current offer, the value to me is 19. This means player 1 has 490. In order to get closer to 250, I need to give up about half the items.\n\n    Let's consider offering Player 1 half of each item, rounded to the nearest integer where possible. This might get me close to where I want to be. If I offer this:\n\n    [1, 3, 3, 1, 2] to Player 1\n    Then I keep:\n    [1, 3, 2, 1, 1] for myself.\n\n    My value is (1 * 4) + (3 * 5) + (2 * 32) + (1 * 61) + (1 * 63) = 4 + 15 + 64 + 61 + 63 = 207.\n\n    Because 207 < 425, then the counteroffer will result in me walking, so I will try to get closer to half.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1 this: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n    Then I keep [2, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n    Value: (2 * 4) + (4 * 5) + (3 * 32) + (2 * 61) + (3 * 63) = 8 + 20 + 96 + 122 + 189 = 435.\n\n    This is much better, as it is slightly larger than my outside value. I need to discount this based on the round. The value is then 435 * 0.9^0 = 435.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is terrible (value 19).\n   - Walking away gives me 425.\n   - A potential counteroffer is [0, 2, 2, 0, 0], giving me a value of 435.\n\nTherefore, I should make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analysis of the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 59\n*   My values for the items: item 1: 67, item 2: 25, item 3: 96, item 4: 41, item 5: 16\n*   Total pool of items: item 1: 3, item 2: 2, item 3: 2, item 4: 7, item 5: 4\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.  This means that accepting an offer later in the game is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 2, 2, 0, 4]. This means I would get:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 67 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 25 = 50\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 96 = 192\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 41 = 0\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 16 = 64\n    *   Total value of current offer: 0 + 50 + 192 + 0 + 64 = 306\n\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer's value to me is 306, which is significantly greater than my outside offer of 59.\n\n*   **Consider a counteroffer:** Before deciding whether to accept, let's consider if I can get an even better deal with a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, but I also have to be realistic about what Player 1 will accept. Since my discount factor is 0.9, getting more value now is better than potentially a little bit more later.\n\n    Let's see what giving player 1 half of everything and keeping half for myself would yield. Given total items of [3, 2, 2, 7, 4], giving player 1 roughly half would mean giving [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n\n    If I give Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 3, 2], I get [2, 1, 1, 4, 2]. This yields a value of:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 67 = 134\n    *   1 units of item 2: 1 * 25 = 25\n    *   1 units of item 3: 1 * 96 = 96\n    *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 41 = 164\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 16 = 32\n    *   Total value of counteroffer: 134 + 25 + 96 + 164 + 32 = 451.\n    This is even higher than 306.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of 306 is much higher than my outside offer of 59. However, if I offer player 1 [1, 1, 1, 3, 2], that yields a value of 451.\n\nLet's make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 0, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 2, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 2, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 59\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 67, Item 2: 25, Item 3: 96, Item 4: 41, Item 5: 16\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 7, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 of its face value, making it less desirable than the same offer accepted in round 2 (0.9) or round 1 (1).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [0, 0, 2, 2, 4]\n    This means I receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 67 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 25 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 96 = 192\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 41 = 82\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 16 = 64\n    Total value = 0 + 0 + 192 + 82 + 64 = 338\n    Discounted value (round 2) = 338 * 0.9 = 304.2\n\n*   **Previous Offer to Player 1:** [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n    This means I would keep:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 67 = 134\n    *   1 units of item 2: 1 * 25 = 25\n    *   1 units of item 3: 1 * 96 = 96\n    *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 41 = 164\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 16 = 32\n    Total value = 134 + 25 + 96 + 164 + 32 = 451\n    Discounted value (round 1) = 451 * 1 = 451\n\n*   **Consider a counteroffer.** I want to construct a counteroffer that is better than 59 for me and also better than player 1's outside option (which I don't know). The current offer gives me 304.2, which is pretty good. My previous offer was 451.\n\nSince I don't know Player 1's valuation, making a safe but relatively generous offer might be the best strategy to avoid a walk away. I'll aim for a split that's better than my outside option, and hopefully better than theirs too.\n\nLet's try giving the other player: [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]\nThis offer means I keep:\n* 2 units of item 1: 2 * 67 = 134\n* 1 units of item 2: 1 * 25 = 25\n* 1 units of item 3: 1 * 96 = 96\n* 4 units of item 4: 4 * 41 = 164\n* 2 units of item 5: 2 * 16 = 32\nTotal value = 134 + 25 + 96 + 164 + 32 = 451\nDiscounted value = 451 * 0.9 = 405.9\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nAccepting the current offer yields a discounted value of 304.2, which is much better than my outside option of 59.\nOffering [1, 1, 1, 3, 2] would yield a value of 405.9.\n\nGiven these numbers, accepting the offer looks like the best decision as it already gives a high value. However, there is still room to negotiate in my favor by making a new offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 25. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 777 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 25\n*   My item values: item 1: 25, item 2: 57, item 3: 92, item 4: 48, item 5: 37\n*   Total pool of items: 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 25 = 25\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 57 = 114\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 92 = 92\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 48 = 96\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 37 = 37\n    *   Total value of current offer: 25 + 114 + 92 + 96 + 37 = 364\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 364, which is significantly greater than my outside offer of 25.\n\n*   **Consider a Potential Counteroffer:** Since I am getting offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] meaning Player 1 is keeping [1, 3, 2, 2, 1].\nLet's calculate what an even split would look like. I will calculate the values for the offers I would give to Player 1.\n\n* Item 1: Offer 1 to Player 1, keep 1.\n* Item 2: Offer 3 to Player 1, keep 2.\n* Item 3: Offer 2 to Player 1, keep 1.\n* Item 4: Offer 2 to Player 1, keep 2.\n* Item 5: Offer 1 to Player 1, keep 1.\nProposed offer to Player 1: [1, 3, 2, 2, 1]\n\nValue of offer to me:\n* 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 25 = 25\n* 2 units of item 2: 2 * 57 = 114\n* 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 92 = 92\n* 2 unit of item 4: 2 * 48 = 96\n* 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 37 = 37\nTotal value: 25 + 114 + 92 + 96 + 37 = 364\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of 364 is significantly greater than my outside offer of 25. If I propose a counteroffer and it gets rejected, next round will be worth 0.9 * counteroffer. Thus, it's better to take the good offer now.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n",

In this case, I get:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 53 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 14 = 0\n    *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 68 = 272\n    *   6 units of item 4: 6 * 50 = 300\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 9 = 0\n    *   Total value of this outcome: 572\n\nSince this offer doesn't reach my outside offer value, I need to give them fewer items.\n\nHow about I offer Player 1 the following: [5, 1, 4, 7, 2]. That means I get nothing. Let's try to improve upon their offer a bit. I'll counteroffer them only the less-valuable items to me, and see if that's enough to get me past my reservation value:\n\nLet's make my counteroffer as such, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then I would be getting a value of:\n5*53 + 1*14 + 4*68 + 7*50 + 2*9 = 265 + 14 + 272 + 350 + 18 = 919\n\nSince this exceeds my reservation value, let's try this counteroffer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI should propose a counteroffer that gives me value greater than my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 837\n*   My values of the items: item 1: 53, item 2: 14, item 3: 68, item 4: 50, item 5: 9\n*   Total pool of items: item 1: 5, item 2: 1, item 3: 4, item 4: 7, item 5: 2\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value, making earlier acceptance more valuable.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: I am offered [1, 1, 0, 7, 2]. This means:\n    *   1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 53 = 53\n    *   1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 14 = 14\n    *   0 units of item 3 = 0 * 68 = 0\n    *   7 units of item 4 = 7 * 50 = 350\n    *   2 units of item 5 = 2 * 9 = 18\n    *   Total value of current offer = 53 + 14 + 0 + 350 + 18 = 435\n\n*   Comparison to outside offer: The current offer (435) is significantly less than my outside offer (837).\n\n*   Potential counteroffers: I need to keep in mind that it is round 2, meaning only one round is left. I have the following items to allocate to myself and player 1:\n    *   Item 1: 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 7 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n\n    If I walked away last round and player 1 has improved their offer, it suggests that they might be aiming for a deal. Given that the current offer provides me with a value of 435, significantly below my outside offer of 837, and we are in Round 2 with gamma = 0.9, it might be worthwhile to make a counteroffer that favors me significantly.\n\n    Let's consider an extreme counteroffer where I take almost everything. I give Player 1 only: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   Item 1: 4 units = 4 * 53 = 212\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit = 1 * 14 = 14\n    *   Item 3: 4 units = 4 * 68 = 272\n    *   Item 4: 7 units = 7 * 50 = 350\n    *   Item 5: 2 units = 2 * 9 = 18\n    *   Total value = 212 + 14 + 272 + 350 + 18 = 866\n\n    Since 866 > 837, even with the gamma discount in round 3, I will still likely get more than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 108. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 711 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "My reasoning:\n\n1. Analyzing the situation:\n\u2003\u2022 My outside offer guarantees a value of 108.\n\u2003\u2022 I value items as follows: item1 = 29 per unit, item2 = 50, item3 = 14, item4 = 45, item5 = 99.\n\u2003\u2022 The total available items are: 6 of item1, 3 of item2, 2 of item3, 5 of item4, and 1 of item5.\n\u2003\u2022 Since we are at round\u202f1 with a discount factor \u03b3 = 0.9, any deal reached now is not discounted. Waiting would mean potential discounting in later rounds so reaching an immediate agreement is attractive if the deal gives me more than 108 in my value.\n\n2. Assessing possible offers:\n\u2003\u2022 I want to maximize my own payoff. My full allocation would bring a total value of 676, though I must leave something for Player\u202f2 to make the offer acceptable.\n\u2003\u2022 Since I have a strong position relative to my outside offer (108), I can offer my opponent minimal items.\n\u2003\u2022 For example, if I offer them nothing, they might reject since their share would be 0 and likely below their own outside offer.\n\u2003\u2022 I can try a minimal incentive offer. Suppose I give them 1 unit of an item that they might value (and which for me is valuable as well but I can spare one unit without sacrificing much). Item2, with a value for me of 50 per unit, is a reasonable candidate.\n\u2003\u2022 Offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] means:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f2 gets 0 units of item1, 1 unit of item2, 0 of item3, 0 of item4, and 0 of item5.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I keep the remainder: 6 of item1, (3\u20131)=2 of item2, 2 of item3, 5 of item4, and 1 of item5.\n\u2003\u2022 My resulting value then is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item1: 6\u00d729 = 174\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item2: 2\u00d750 = 100\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item3: 2\u00d714 = 28\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item4: 5\u00d745 = 225\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item5: 1\u00d799 = 99\n\u2003\u2003Total = 174 + 100 + 28 + 225 + 99 = 626, which is far above my outside offer of 108.\n\u2003\u2022 Despite being highly skewed in my favor, offering one unit of item2 may give Player\u202f2 just enough potential benefit to encourage negotiations at this early stage.\n\n3. Decision:\n\u2003\u2022 I am not accepting any current offer (none is on the table).\n\u2003\u2022 I am not walking away because my potential gain (626 in my value if agreed) is much higher than my outside offer (108).\n\u2003\u2022 I therefore propose a counteroffer that gives Player\u202f2 the minimal allocation [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] while I keep the rest.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 182.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 12, item 2 = 17, item 3 = 23, item 4 = 99, item 5 = 5.\n*   The total pool of items is: 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer is (0 * 12) + (1 * 17) + (0 * 23) + (0 * 99) + (0 * 5) = 17.\n    *   Since 17 is much less than my outside offer of 182, accepting is not a good option.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to determine what a good counteroffer might look like. My goal is to get a deal worth more than 182. I need to keep as much of item 4 as possible, since it has the highest value for me. Item 1 has the lowest value for me.\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I give the other player all of item 1 and item 2, give nothing to the other player from item 4, and give them half of items 3 and 5. That would look like:\n\n    Offer to player 1: [6, 3, 1, 0, 0.5]\n\n    This means I get:\n    * 0 units of item 1 = 0 * 12 = 0\n    * 0 units of item 2 = 0 * 17 = 0\n    * 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 23 = 23\n    * 5 units of item 4 = 5 * 99 = 495\n    * 0.5 unit of item 5 = 0.5 * 5 = 2.5\n    * Total value = 0 + 0 + 23 + 495 + 2.5 = 520.5\n\n    Another consideration is giving all of item 1, item 2, and item 3 and splitting item 4 roughly 50/50. This would look like:\n\n    Offer to player 1: [6, 3, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    This means I get:\n    * 0 units of item 1 = 0 * 12 = 0\n    * 0 units of item 2 = 0 * 17 = 0\n    * 0 units of item 3 = 0 * 23 = 0\n    * 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 99 = 297\n    * 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 5 = 5\n    * Total value = 0 + 0 + 0 + 297 + 5 = 302\n\n    I will look at a lower offer on item 4:\n\n    Offer to player 1: [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    This means I get:\n    * 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 12 = 36\n    * 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 17 = 34\n    * 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 23 = 23\n    * 4 units of item 4 = 4 * 99 = 396\n    * 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 5 = 5\n    * Total value = 36 + 34 + 23 + 396 + 5 = 494\n\n    I will look at a higher offer on item 4:\n\n    Offer to player 1: [1, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\n    This means I get:\n    * 5 units of item 1 = 5 * 12 = 60\n    * 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 17 = 51\n    * 2 unit of item 3 = 2 * 23 = 46\n    * 1 units of item 4 = 1 * 99 = 99\n    * 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 5 = 5\n    * Total value = 60 + 51 + 46 + 99 + 5 = 261\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. I will make a counteroffer that still gives a large portion of item 4. The other items I am okay with offering to Player 1.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 4, 0]}\n",

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 168.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 25, item 2 = 93, item 3 = 22, item 4 = 24, item 5 = 21.\n   - The total pool of items is: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now. For example, an offer worth 200 in round 2 is worth 200 * 0.9 = 180 in present value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** The current offer gives me 3 units of item 3. My value for this offer is 3 * 22 = 66. This is much lower than my outside offer of 168.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what counteroffers might be acceptable to Player 1 while still giving me a value greater than 168. Let's calculate the value if I keep all items for myself, which is 3*25 + 3*93 + 3*22 + 3*24 + 4*21 = 75 + 279 + 66 + 72 + 84 = 576.\n\n   I want to find an offer (what I give to Player 1) that gives me more than 168 value. This means I need to keep value of more than 168 for myself.\n\n   Consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 all of item 1 (3 units), all of item 4 (3 units), and one unit of item 5. That is [3,0,0,3,1]\n   My value will be 3*93 + 3*22 + 3*21 = 279 + 66 + 63 = 408 > 168\n   Player 1 would get 3*item1 + 3*item4 + 1*item5. I don't know Player 1's preferences but giving these items might be something that they will consider.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 66, which is less than my outside offer. So I will not accept.\n   - Walking away gives me a value of 168.\n   - Making a counteroffer is risky, but it could potentially give me a higher value than my outside offer if Player 1 accepts.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1164. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1290 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 3, 3, 3]. This means I get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 45 = 45\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 10 = 10\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 81 = 243\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 72 = 216\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 19 = 57\n    *   Total value of current offer: 45 + 10 + 243 + 216 + 57 = 571\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would keep for myself in different counteroffer scenarios. Since it's round 1, I want to aim for a deal that's better than my outside offer, even after the discount factor is applied in later rounds.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer of 571 is less than my outside offer of 712. Therefore, accepting it now is not optimal.\n\nLet's consider some potential counteroffers:\nI have 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 7 of item 3, 6 of item 4, 6 of item 5\nLet's say I offer the other player 1,0, 3, 3, 3. That means I keep:\n1 unit of item 1: 1 * 45 = 45\n1 unit of item 2: 1 * 10 = 10\n4 units of item 3: 4 * 81 = 324\n3 units of item 4: 3 * 72 = 216\n3 units of item 5: 3 * 19 = 57\nTotal value = 45 + 10 + 324 + 216 + 57 = 652\nThis is still less than 712, so is not good enough.\n\nLet's say I offer the other player 0,0, 0, 0, 0. That means I keep:\n2 unit of item 1: 2 * 45 = 90\n1 unit of item 2: 1 * 10 = 10\n7 units of item 3: 7 * 81 = 567\n6 units of item 4: 6 * 72 = 432\n6 units of item 5: 6 * 19 = 114\nTotal value = 90 + 10 + 567 + 432 + 114 = 1213\nThis is better than 712. The problem is that player 1 will likely walk.\n\nLet's say I offer the other player 1,0, 3, 3, 0. That means I keep:\n1 unit of item 1: 1 * 45 = 45\n1 unit of item 2: 1 * 10 = 10\n4 units of item 3: 4 * 81 = 324\n3 units of item 4: 3 * 72 = 216\n6 units of item 5: 6 * 19 = 114\nTotal value = 45 + 10 + 324 + 216 + 114 = 709\nThis is slightly less than my walkaway.\n\n**Optimal Choice**\nGiven that the current offer is less than my outside offer, I should counteroffer. I believe that it is best to offer 1,0,3,3,3. I can improve my position in later rounds if Player 1 makes a new offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 3, 3, 3]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 712. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 3, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 3, 3, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 4, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 4, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 712\n*   My values for items: item 1: 45, item 2: 10, item 3: 81, item 4: 72, item 5: 19\n*   Total items: item 1: 2, item 2: 1, item 3: 7, item 4: 6, item 5: 6\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value, and an offer in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 4, 3, 3]. This means I get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 45 = 45\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 10 = 0\n    *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 81 = 324\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 72 = 216\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 19 = 57\n    *   Total value: 45 + 0 + 324 + 216 + 57 = 642\n    *   Discounted value (round 2): 642 * 0.9 = 577.8\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer's discounted value (577.8) is less than my outside offer (712).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I want to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, considering the discount factor. It's Round 2, so the discount is 0.9. Since I want to maximize my own value, I want to give Player 1 as little as possible while still reaching an agreement. Let's consider offering player 1 exactly what I offered in round 1.\n\n    *   My previous offer to Player 1: [1, 0, 3, 3, 3]\n    *   This means I would keep:\n        *   Item 1: 2 - 1 = 1 unit * 45 = 45\n        *   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1 unit * 10 = 10\n        *   Item 3: 7 - 3 = 4 units * 81 = 324\n        *   Item 4: 6 - 3 = 3 units * 72 = 216\n        *   Item 5: 6 - 3 = 3 units * 19 = 57\n        *   Total value: 45 + 10 + 324 + 216 + 57 = 652\n        *   Discounted value (round 2): 652 * 0.9 = 586.8\n    This offer is still below my walkaway\n\n    Since I need to get at least 712 / 0.9 = 791.1 to make an offer that is better than walking away I should walk away.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is worth 577.8 and my outside offer is worth 712, I should walk away unless I can get the other player to significantly increase their offer to me. Since I need to get to 791.1, and the other player hasn't budged much, I should walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

I therefore cannot afford to leave myself less than 736 in any negotiated division.\n\n\u2022 My item values are:\n\u2003Item 1: 39 per unit (4 units available)\n\u2003Item 2: 78 per unit (5 units available)\n\u2003Item 3: 45 per unit (8 units available)\n\u2003Item 4: 39 per unit (2 units available)\n\u2003Item 5: 2 per unit (4 units available)\n\n\u2022 As the proposer in round 1 the discount factor (\u03b3 = 0.9) does not yet affect the payoff because discounting applies only from round 2 onward (\u03b3^(round-1)=\u03b3^0=1 for round 1). Thus, reaching agreement quickly is better for both sides but I can try to be minimally generous while keeping my own value high.\n\n\u2022 I want to maximize my own share as long as it is above my reservation value of 736. A way to do that is to offer the other party items that cost me little. Item 5, with a low value (2 per unit) is ideal. To make the offer a little more attractive, I also offer 1 unit of item 4 (costing me 39) since I value it moderately but can afford to concede a bit.\n\n\u2022 Under the proposed offer, the division is:\n\u2003Offer to Player 2: [0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 4 units of item 5].\n\u2003Then I would keep:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 4 units \u2192 4\u00d739 = 156\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 5 units \u2192 5\u00d778 = 390\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 8 units \u2192 8\u00d745 = 360\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 2 \u2013 1 = 1 unit \u2192 1\u00d739 = 39\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 4 \u2013 4 = 0 units \u2192 0\u00d72 = 0 \n\u2003Total = 156+390+360+39 = 945, which is well above my reservation value.\n\n\u2022 Though I don\u2019t know Player 2\u2019s valuations, offering them items with low value to me (especially all of item 5 and 1 unit of item 4) is intended to be just enough of a concession so that they might prefer a deal now over their uncertain outside offer.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 4]}",

This leaves me with [2, 3, 4, 1, 2] which has value (2*52) + (3*73) + (4*13) + (1*23) + (2*10) = 104 + 219 + 52 + 23 + 20 = 418.\n    *   **Counteroffer 3 (A little more generous):** [1, 1, 2, 0, 1].  This leaves me with [3, 4, 6, 2, 3] which has value (3*52) + (4*73) + (6*13) + (2*23) + (3*10) = 156 + 292 + 78 + 46 + 30 = 602.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is already worth 63 which is greater than my outside offer of 35, I am not inclined to walk away.\nHowever, if I can negotiate for something better then that will be optimal.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 736. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 609 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 35.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 52, item 2 = 73, item 3 = 13, item 4 = 23, item 5 = 10.\n*   The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. Since we are in round 2, accepting now means the value is multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 4]. This means:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 52 = 52\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 73 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 13 = 26\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 23 = 0\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 10 = 40\n    *   Total value of current offer: 52 + 0 + 26 + 0 + 40 = 118.\n    *   Discounted value of accepting now: 118 * 0.9 = 106.2\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** It's hard to evaluate all potential counteroffers without knowing Player 1's values. However, I can aim for an offer that gives me more value than 35/0.9 = 38.89, which is the minimum I need to make accepting in round 3 better than walking.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current discounted offer value (106.2) is much greater than my outside offer (35).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Since the current offer's discounted value (106.2) significantly exceeds my outside offer (35), accepting seems reasonable.\n*   However, it's still round 2. Let's make a counteroffer to try to improve the deal, but if that fails then there is still round 3.\n*   My previous offer was [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]. Player 1 responded by improving my offer of item 1 and item 5.\n*   I want more of item 2, but since they didn't give me item 2 last round, I need to instead offer more item 1. My current offer is [1, 0, 2, 0, 4] items to me, thus Player 1 gets [3, 5, 6, 2, 0]. Let's counteroffer [2, 4, 5, 1, 0] to Player 1. That means I would get [2, 1, 3, 1, 4] and I calculate the value to me as: (2*52) + (1*73) + (3*13) + (1*23) + (4*10) = 104 + 73 + 39 + 23 + 40 = 279. This is very good. If Player 1 also values these items in a way where my offer to them is also reasonable, this may work.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 5, 1, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 935\n*   My values per item: item 1: 92, item 2: 59, item 3: 88, item 4: 90, item 5: 65\n*   Total items: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value for this offer is (1 * 92) + (0 * 59) + (0 * 88) + (0 * 90) + (0 * 65) = 92.\n\n*   **Compare to outside offer:**  92 is significantly less than my outside offer of 935.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I can offer Player 1 that would be better than my outside offer and their presumed outside offer. First, let's calculate the total value of all the items to me:\n    (3 * 92) + (4 * 59) + (1 * 88) + (4 * 90) + (3 * 65) = 276 + 236 + 88 + 360 + 195 = 1155\n\nLet's try to find an offer to Player 1 that will bring a value more than 935, but still leave me more. To avoid a long calculation in round 1, let's start with an offer where I try to give them all of Item 4. That will reduce my total by around 360, leaving about 800 to me.\nThen I keep 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. I should make a counteroffer. Let's offer Player 1 all the item 4 to start and some amount of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 4 Units of item 4, 0 units of Item 5: [3, 0, 0, 4, 0]. This means I will keep zero of Item 1. This would leave me with : 0 * 92+4 * 59 + 1 * 88+0 * 90 +3 * 65=0 + 236 + 88 + 0 + 195 = 519\nThis is much less than my outside offer. So instead, I will give them 1 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5: [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]. This leaves me with 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5. This equals : 2 * 92+4 * 59 + 1 * 88+1 * 90 +3 * 65=184 + 236 + 88 + 90 + 195 = 793. So that won't work.\n\nI will give them 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]. This leaves me with 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5. This equals : 3 * 92+4 * 59 + 1 * 88+1 * 90 +3 * 65=276 + 236 + 88 + 90 + 195 = 885. Still less than my outside offer.\nI will give them 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]. This leaves me with 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5. This equals : 3 * 92+4 * 59 + 1 * 88+2 * 90 +3 * 65=276 + 236 + 88 + 180 + 195 = 975.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 321. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 678 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 436. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 891 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 574. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1002 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 824. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 993 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If no agreement is reached, we get 696.\n\u2003\u2022 Our private values per unit are item1:3, item2:56, item3:11, item4:71, item5:44.\n\u2003\u2022 The total pool is: 5 of item1, 4 of item2, 3 of item3, 7 of item4, and 7 of item5.\n\u2003\u2022 With a discount factor \u03b3 = 0.9, if we delay agreement (moving to later rounds) our outcome\u2019s present value would be reduced (\u03b3^(round-1)). In round 1, the full value is received (multiplied by 1), so it is in our interest to secure a deal now if it is good enough.\n\n2. Assessing offers:\n\u2003\u2022 As the proposer in round 1 there is no offer on the table. We must propose a division.\n\u2003\u2022 We need to ensure that the deal we secure gives us a total value, calculated by (units kept)*(my value per unit) across items, of at least 696.\n\u2003\u2022 Since our high-valued items for us are items 2 (56), 4 (71), and 5 (44), we want to keep nearly all those while conceding items that are of low value to us but might be more attractive to Player 2 (like items 1 and 3, where our values are 3 and 11).\n\u2003\u2022 Consider keeping all of item2 (4 units), all of item4 (7 units), and almost all of item5 (6 out of 7 units) for ourselves. That would yield:\n\u2003\u2003- Item2: 4\u00d756 = 224\n\u2003\u2003- Item4: 7\u00d771 = 497\n\u2003\u2003- Item5: 6\u00d744 = 264\n\u2003\u2003Total = 224 + 497 + 264 = 985, which is well above our outside offer.\n\u2003\u2022 In exchange, we offer Player 2 full amounts of item1 and item3 (which are lower in our valuation) and a small concession of 1 unit of item5 to potentially make the offer appealing to them.\n\u2003\u2022 The proposed counteroffer, as given to Player 2, is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 5 units (all),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3 units (all),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 1 unit.\n\u2003\u2022 Under this proposal, our share becomes the remaining items:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 4 units,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 7 units,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 6 units.\n\u2003\u2022 Our value is 985, which is safely above 696, and we hope that by giving Player 2 all of item1 and item3 plus a unit of item5, they might find it acceptable given their private (and possibly favorable) valuations on these items.\n\n3. Decision:\n\u2003\u2022 We will make this counteroffer. It gives us a high value (985) compared to our outside offer while providing a nontrivial package to Player 2 that might meet or exceed their expectations.\n\nThe final action is therefore:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 3, 0, 1]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 164. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 876 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 295. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.
