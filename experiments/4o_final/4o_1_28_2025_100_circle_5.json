Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 830. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 830. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 726 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 7, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 48 x 1 + 93 x 2 + 82 x 7 + 7 x 3\n    which is 829 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 830. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

This means that the value of an agreed offer will decrease in the next round if not accepted. Therefore, it's better to secure a favorable offer earlier rather than waiting too long and having the potential value decrease.\n\n2) **Offer Assessment:**\n\n   - Currently, there is no offer on the table. \n   - To ensure I propose a counteroffer that is more valuable than my outside offer, I need a division where the value to me exceeds 632.\n\n3) **Potential Counteroffer Calculation:**\n\n   - Let's calculate values of different splits. I need to make sure I retain enough value to exceed my outside offer.\n   - A strategy is to aim for a high-value item to secure the required value. I could attempt to keep as much of the high-value (to me) items, particularly items 1, 2 and 3.\n\n   Let's try a division where I prioritize higher valued items:\n   \n   - Propose an offer where:\n     - I give Player 2: [0, 1, 0, 6, 2]\n     - I keep: [3, 4, 4, 0, 3]\n\n   Calculate my value for keeping:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 61 = 183\n   - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 58 = 232\n   - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 55 = 220\n   - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 16 = 0\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n\n   Total Value = 183 + 232 + 220 + 0 + 36 = 671\n\n   - My calculated value of keeping these items is 671, which is better than my outside offer of 632.\n\nBased on the calculations above, I am making a counteroffer that should ensure I receive more value than my outside offer. \n\n**My Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 6, 2]}\n```",

I need to try keeping more valuable items.\n\n   Revising to keep:\n   - 4 units of item 1: 4 x 87 = 348\n   - 2 units of item 2: 2 x 66 = 132\n   - 2 units of item 3: 2 x 76 = 152\n   - 1 units of item 4: 1 x 55 = 55\n   - 1 unit of item 5: 1 x 30 = 30\n\n   - Total value = 348 + 132 + 152 + 55 + 30 = 717\n\n   To improve this offer, I might consider maximizing certain high-value items to myself:\n\n   Trying to keep:\n   - 5 units of item 1: 5 x 87 = 435\n   - 3 units of item 2: 3 x 66 = 198\n   - 1 unit of item 3: 1 x 76 = 76\n   - 1 units of item 4: 1 x 55 = 55\n   - 0 unit of item 5: 0 x 30 = 0\n\n   New Total value = 435 + 198 + 76 + 55 = 764, below the outside offer. This seems the closest but doesn't quite cover.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nGiven the calculations and exhausting higher combinations, keeping:\n   - 4 units of item 1: 4 x 87 = 348\n   - 3 units of item 2: 3 x 66 = 198\n   - 2 units of item 3: 2 x 76 = 152\n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 x 55 = 110\n   - 1 unit of item 5: 1 x 30 = 30\n\nThe sum now reaches = 838, still not enough, but feasible with lower discount in future rounds, hence feasible.\n\nBased on this, I will propose a counteroffer aiming to maximize allocations and cover my fallback with changes in small values:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]} ",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 274. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 768 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 1 + 45 x 1 + 65 x 2 + 32 x 1 + 49 x 0\n    which is 272 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 274.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 274. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 768 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 1 + 45 x 1 + 65 x 2 + 32 x 1 + 49 x 0\n    which is 272 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 274. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since it is round 2 now, any accepted offer will be multiplied by \\(0.9^{(2-1)} = 0.9\\).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n     - Value calculation:\n       - Item 1: 0 units x 65 = 0\n       - Item 2: 1 unit x 45 = 45\n       - Item 3: 1 unit x 65 = 65\n       - Item 4: 1 unit x 32 = 32\n       - Item 5: 0 units x 49 = 0\n     - Total value = 45 + 65 + 32 = 142\n     - Discounted value to me = \\(142 \\times 0.9 = 127.8\\)\n\n   - My outside offer is 274, which is higher than 127.8 from the current offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - I should not accept the current offer because its value (127.8) is less than my outside offer (274).\n   - I should not walk away immediately as I can propose a better counteroffer to maximize my value. \n\nLet's consider a potential counteroffer that maximizes my value but remains fair:\n   - Aim to keep items primarily with higher values to me, without exceeding the outside offer.\n     - Try keeping 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5:\n\n     - New counteroffer: Offer [2, 3, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1\n     - Which means I get [3, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n     - Value calculation:\n       - Item 1: 3 units x 65 = 195\n       - Item 2: 0 units x 45 = 0\n       - Item 3: 1 unit x 65 = 65\n       - Item 4: 1 unit x 32 = 32\n       - Item 5: 0 units x 49 = 0\n     - Total value = 195 + 65 + 32 = 292\n     - Discounted value = \\(292 \\times 0.9 = 262.8\\)\n\n   - Offer [2, 3, 1, 1, 1] broadly respects the total divisions and gives me a higher value after considering the discount factor. However, it should be noted this is less than my outside offer (274). Let's adjust to seek a better balance.\n\nAfter recalculation, I should adjust my counteroffer to ensure value aligns strongly with objectives.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 618. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 648 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 9, 3, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 0 + 28 x 9 + 96 x 3 + 17 x 1 + 30 x 2\n    which is 617 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 618. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 3, 3, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 3, 3, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I need to analyze the current offer and evaluate whether it's beneficial compared to my outside offer. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 618.\n   - My private values per item are:\n     - Item 1: 45\n     - Item 2: 28\n     - Item 3: 96\n     - Item 4: 17\n     - Item 5: 30\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - Item 1: 3 units\n     - Item 2: 9 units\n     - Item 3: 3 units\n     - Item 4: 4 units\n     - Item 5: 4 units\n   - Discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, but since it's round 1, there's no immediate impact from the discount.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer to me**: [0, 3, 3, 3, 4]\n     - Value calculation:\n       - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 45 = 0\n       - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 28 = 84\n       - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n       - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n       - 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 30 = 120\n     - Total value = 543\n\nThe current offer's value is 543, which is less than my outside offer of 618. Accepting this offer would be suboptimal because it provides a value lower than my guaranteed fallback.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is not advisable as it is worse than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away is an option, but first, let's determine if a counteroffer can give me more than my outside offer.\n   - For a counteroffer, let's try to keep more items with higher values:\n\n   Let's propose that I get 2 units of items 3 and 5, which are most valuable to me, and 8 units of item 2. Offer the rest to Player 1.\n\n   - Proposed offer to Player 1: [3, 1, 1, 4, 2]\n     - This means I take:\n       - 0 units of item 1\n       - 8 units of item 2: 8 \u00d7 28 = 224\n       - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n       - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 17 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n     - Total value = 476\n\nThis counteroffer also does not exceed my outside offer. Therefore I was incorrect and should not offer this.\n\nI will offer to give Player 1 the set [2, 4, 1, 4, 4] and request the remainder.\n\n- For me, this means:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n  - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 28 = 140\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 17 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 30 = 0\n- Total value = 377\n\nThis is also not suitable since it does not exceed the outside offer.\n\nIf creating better offers continues to be troublesome, walking away might be the best option for this round.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 20. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 501 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    79 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 31 x 0 + 5 x 1\n    which is 5 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 20. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus, I should not accept the current offer.\n   - Walking away guarantees me a value of 411.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 411.\n\nTo maximize my value, I should consider keeping as many high-value items to myself, especially focusing on Item 4, which has the highest value for me. \n\nLet's evaluate a potential counteroffer:\nIf I offer Player 1 [1, 1, 2, 0, 2] (I keep [3, 0, 3, 3, 2]):\n- Item 1: 3 units x 6 = 18\n- Item 2: 0 units x 22 = 0\n- Item 3: 3 units x 56 = 168\n- Item 4: 3 units x 96 = 288\n- Item 5: 2 units x 15 = 30\n- Total value = 504\n\nThis value (504) is greater than my outside offer (411), so it is a valid counteroffer with a higher value for me. Thus, I avoid Mistake 2 and Mistake 5 by proposing this counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 1 + 43 x 1 + 69 x 0 + 68 x 0 + 55 x 2\n    which is 200 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 202. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Accepting this offer in Round 1 gives full value without discounting.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n#### Current Offer:\n- Current offer: [2, 3, 1, 2, 2] (offered to me)\n- My value if I accept the current offer:\n  - \\(2 \\times 67 = 134\\) (Item 1)\n  - \\(3 \\times 88 = 264\\) (Item 2)\n  - \\(1 \\times 47 = 47\\) (Item 3)\n  - \\(2 \\times 28 = 56\\) (Item 4)\n  - \\(2 \\times 90 = 180\\) (Item 5)\n- Total Value if I accept = \\(134 + 264 + 47 + 56 + 180 = 681\\)\n\n#### Comparison with Outside Offer:\n- Value from outside offer = 812\n- Current offer value (681) < Outside offer (812)\n\n### 3) Decision:\nGiven the current offer value (681) is less than my outside offer (812), it would be a mistake to accept it.\n\n#### Counteroffer Assessment:\nNow, calculate a counteroffer that provides a value better than 812. Let's evaluate an initial counteroffer and adjust if needed to exceed 812.\n\nLet's propose keeping: [3, 3, 2, 2, 3]\n- Calculate the value of keeping these items:\n  - \\(3 \\times 67 = 201\\) (Item 1)\n  - \\(3 \\times 88 = 264\\) (Item 2)\n  - \\(2 \\times 47 = 94\\) (Item 3)\n  - \\(2 \\times 28 = 56\\) (Item 4)\n  - \\(3 \\times 90 = 270\\) (Item 5)\n- Total value = \\(201 + 264 + 94 + 56 + 270 = 885\\)\n\n885 is greater than my outside value of 812 and avoids the mistakes.\n\nTherefore, make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\n\nI would offer 2 units of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 1 of item 5 to Player 1.",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 3, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 0 + 75 x 4 + 47 x 3 + 83 x 2 + 48 x 3\n    which is 751 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 752. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine my action, I will analyze the current situation and evaluate the offer.\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 752.\n   - My values per unit of each item are:\n     - Item 1: 67\n     - Item 2: 75\n     - Item 3: 47\n     - Item 4: 83\n     - Item 5: 48\n   - Total items are: [1, 4, 3, 2, 5]\n   - Discount factor gamma = 0.9. Since it's the first round, this doesn't affect the immediate value.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer [1, 0, 3, 0, 5] gives me:\n     - 1 unit of Item 1: 1 x 67 = 67\n     - 0 unit of Item 2: 0 x 75 = 0\n     - 3 units of Item 3: 3 x 47 = 141\n     - 0 unit of Item 4: 0 x 83 = 0\n     - 5 units of Item 5: 5 x 48 = 240\n     - Total value = 67 + 141 + 240 = 448\n\n   - Current offer value of 448 is less than my outside offer of 752.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Accepting this offer would yield less value than my outside offer, which is suboptimal.\n   - Walking away would guarantee my outside offer value of 752.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me more than 752 in value.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that will be better for me. I need to adjust the division:\n\nTo maximize my value while improving over the current offer, I'll aim to keep more of the high-value items, especially items 2 and 4:\n\n- Try keeping all items of type 1, 2 of type 2, 0 of type 3, 2 of type 4, and 5 of type 5 for me.

I need to adjust more:\n\n- Try keeping all items of type 1, 4 units of type 2, 1 of type 3, 1 of type 4, and 3 of type 5 for me. Offer:\n  - [0, 0, 2, 1, 2] to Player 1.\n\nCalculate my value for this counteroffer:\n\n- 1 unit of Item 1: 67 x 1 = 67\n- 4 units of Item 2: 75 x 4 = 300 (keep all)\n- 1 unit of Item 3: 47 x 1 = 47 (keep 1)\n- 1 unit of Item 4: 83 x 1 = 83 (keep 1)\n- 3 units of Item 5: 48 x 3 = 144 (keep 3)\n- Total value: 67 + 300 + 47 + 83 + 144 = 641\n\nThis is still below, so the counteroffer needs to be adjusted again possibly keeping almost all items of 2 and 4 since they are high value:\n\n- Try keeping all items of type 1, all units of type 2, 0 of type 3, 2 of type 4, and 0 of type 5 for me.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 1 + 50 x 1 + 71 x 2 + 46 x 0 + 83 x 3\n    which is 442 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 443. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 640. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 819 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 5, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 2 + 30 x 1 + 41 x 5 + 77 x 2 + 39 x 2\n    which is 639 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 640. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 4, 2, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 5 + 27 x 4 + 63 x 2 + 49 x 2 + 25 x 1\n    which is 687 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 688. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To decide on the best action, let's analyze the current situation and the value of the offers step-by-step.\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 653.\n- **Values of Items:** \n  - Item 1 = 73\n  - Item 2 = 5\n  - Item 3 = 31\n  - Item 4 = 96\n  - Item 5 = 92\n- **Total Pool of Items:** \n  - 6 units of item 1\n  - 6 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor is 0.9. In round 2, the effective value of any negotiated outcome will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means any negotiation now will have 90% of its original value to me.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer to Me:** [1, 6, 0, 0, 1]. Let's calculate its value to me:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit x 73 = 73\n  - Item 2: 6 units x 5 = 30\n  - Item 3: 0 units x 31 = 0\n  - Item 4: 0 units x 96 = 0\n  - Item 5: 1 unit x 92 = 92\n  - Total value = 73 + 30 + 92 = 195\n  - Discounted value = 195 x 0.9 = 175.5\n\n  The discounted value of the current offer is 175.5, which is far less than my outside offer of 653.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffer:** \n  I must propose a counteroffer where my value exceeds 653. Let's find a possible division. \n  Since I must retain a value greater than 653, let me propose I keep more valuable items:\n  - Retain [5, 0, 2, 0, 3], which means the offer to Player 2 is [1, 6, 0, 2, 0].\n\n  Calculating the value of my retained items:\n  - Item 1: 5 units x 73 = 365\n  - Item 2: 0 units x 5 = 0\n  - Item 3: 2 units x 31 = 62\n  - Item 4: 0 units x 96 = 0\n  - Item 5: 3 units x 92 = 276\n  - Total value = 365 + 0 + 62 + 0 + 276 = 703\n\n  The discounted value of this would be 703 x 0.9 = 632.7. It\u2019s still less than 653.\n\n  Let's improve, further reducing item 5 in the offer until the value exceeds 653.\n\n  Retain [5, 0, 2, 1, 2], which means the offer to Player 2 is [1, 6, 0, 1, 1].\n\n  Calculating again:\n  - Item 1: 5 units x 73 = 365\n  - Item 2: 0 units x 5 = 0\n  - Item 3: 2 units x 31 = 62\n  - Item 4: 1 unit x 96 = 96\n  - Item 5: 2 units x 92 = 184\n  - Total value = 365 + 0 + 62 + 96 + 184 = 707\n\n  Discounted value = 707 x 0.9 = 636.3. Still too low.\n\n  Next option might be: Retain [6, 0, 2, 0, 2], which means the offer to Player 2 is [0, 6, 0, 2, 1].\n\n  - Item 1: 6 units x 73 = 438\n  - Item 2: 0 units x 5 = 0\n  - Item 3: 2 units x 31 = 62\n  - Item 4: 0 units x 96 = 0\n  - Item 5: 2 units x 92 = 184\n  - Total value = 438 + 0 + 62 + 0 + 184 = 684\n\n  Discounted value = 684 x 0.9 = 615.6. Still under 653. Let's try for another approach.\n\nAfter several attempts to find a balance that could exceed 653, it becomes evident with the current distributions I might need to offer less from the other items combined instead.\n\n**Final Counteroffer Decision:**\nLet me evaluate offering you a counteroffer aiming as close as possible:\n\nLet\u2019s try again: Retaining [5, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n\n- Item 1: 5 units x 73 = 365\n- Item 2: 0 units x 5 = 0\n- Item 3: 1 unit x 31 = 31 \n- Item 4: 2 units x 96 = 192\n- Item 5: 1 unit x 92 = 92\n- Total value = 365 + 0 + 31 + 192 + 92 = 680\n\nDiscounted value = 680 x 0.9 \u2248 612. Still less than my desired target but might adjust again here, by offering more on Item 3.\n\nThis must ideally go beyond but represent close alterations in values since 653 still remains a high aspect point to achieving, balancing this trade-off whilst observing offers seems tricky to validate within given limits.\n\nThus proposing optimal retained values in closer reach, counteroffer aligns as better choice: \n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\nI propose a counteroffer to allow reducing to closely enhance my negotiable reach.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 0, 3]} \n\nThis is final to improve maintaining offer while calculations support reaching potential obtained scenarios closest possible.",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 4, 2, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 5 + 27 x 4 + 63 x 2 + 49 x 2 + 25 x 1\n    which is 687 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 688. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 6, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** 688\n- **Values of Items for You:**\n  - Item 1: 66\n  - Item 2: 27\n  - Item 3: 63\n  - Item 4: 49\n  - Item 5: 25\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 6\n  - Item 2: 6\n  - Item 3: 2\n  - Item 4: 2\n  - Item 5: 3\n- **Discount Factor:** Negotiation value is adjusted by gamma = 0.9 for each round.\n\n### 2. Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n#### Current Offer:\n- You receive: [2 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 3 of item 5]\n- Calculating your value:\n  - 2 * 66 (Item 1) = 132\n  - 0 * 27 (Item 2) = 0\n  - 1 * 63 (Item 3) = 63\n  - 0 * 49 (Item 4) = 0\n  - 3 * 25 (Item 5) = 75\n- Total Value = 132 + 0 + 63 + 0 + 75 = 270\n- Adjusted for round 2 discount (\\(270 \\times 0.9\\)) = 243\n\n#### Evaluation:\n- The current offer value (243) is significantly less than my outside offer value (688).\n\n### 3. Make a Decision Based on Analysis:\n\nGiven that the current offer value (243) is far below my outside offer value (688), accepting this offer is not advantageous. Therefore, I should consider a counteroffer or walking away.\n\n#### Consider a Counteroffer:\n\nTo ensure my counteroffer is more valuable than my outside offer, my strategy is to keep more items that have higher value to me:\n- Try to keep more units of items 1, 2, 3, and 4, aiming for a value greater than 688.\n\nProposed Counteroffer:\n- Offer [1, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n  - I keep [5, 0, 2, 2, 3]\n\nCalculating the proposed counteroffer value:\n- 5 * 66 (Item 1) = 330\n- 0 * 27 (Item 2) = 0\n- 2 * 63 (Item 3) = 126\n- 2 * 49 (Item 4) = 98\n- 3 * 25 (Item 5) = 75\n- Total Value = 330 + 0 + 126 + 98 + 75 = 629\n\nSince this counteroffer's value (629) is still less than 688, I need to adjust my strategy or decide to walk away. Proposing another would likely require further adjustments either through keeping the same units and receive discounted value or holding more of the most valuable item.\n\nUltimately, a value above 688 is not achievable without heavily favoring my interests, leading to a more reasonable approach of:\n\n#### Final Decision:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 5, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 3 + 88 x 4 + 48 x 5 + 79 x 4 + 69 x 1\n    which is 1001 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1003. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine my next action, let's analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 1003.\n   \n   - My values for each item type are:\n     - Item 1: 8\n     - Item 2: 88\n     - Item 3: 48\n     - Item 4: 79\n     - Item 5: 69\n\n   - The total pool of items consists of:\n     - 4 units Item 1\n     - 4 units Item 2\n     - 6 units Item 3\n     - 5 units Item 4\n     - 2 units Item 5\n\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, but since this is the first round, it does not apply right now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Assessing the current offer of [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]:\n     - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 8 = 16\n     - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 88 = 176\n     - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 48 = 96\n     - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 79 = 79\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 69 = 69\n     - Total value = 16 + 176 + 96 + 79 + 69 = 436\n\n   - The current offer's value (436) is much lower than my outside offer value (1003).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   The current offer's value to me (436) is significantly less than my outside offer value (1003). To justify accepting the offer, it needs to be greater than or at least close to 1003, adjusted for rounds due to the discount factor.\n\n   **Counteroffer Calculation:**\n   - To keep my value above 1003, I should retain a combination of items such that my calculated value is above 1003.\n\n   By trial and error, let's check keeping [2, 3, 4, 4, 1] items for myself:\n   - Items for me: [2, 3, 4, 4, 1]\n   - Value for me: \n     - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 8 = 16\n     - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 88 = 264\n     - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 48 = 192\n     - Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 79 = 316\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 69 = 69\n   - Total value = 16 + 264 + 192 + 316 + 69 = 857\n\nNext, check keeping [2, 4, 4, 3, 1] items for me:\n   - Items for me: [2, 4, 4, 3, 1]\n   - Value for me:\n     - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 8 = 16\n     - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 88 = 352\n     - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 48 = 192\n     - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 79 = 237\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 69 = 69\n   - Total value = 16 + 352 + 192 + 237 + 69 = 866\n   \nFor keeping [3, 3, 3, 1, 2] items, I test next\n   - Value for me: \n     - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 8 = 24\n     - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 88 = 264\n     - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 48 = 144\n     - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 79 = 79\n     - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 69 = 138\n     - Total value = 24 + 264 + 144 + 79 + 138 = 649\n     \n   Remaining trials either exceed maximum units or fail to hit 1003 minimum.  \n\nGiven that keeping [2, 4, 4, 3, 1] items for myself only achieves 866, which still falls below my outside offer, the last workable configuration I can propose would be [3, 4, 3, 4, 1]:\n   - Items for me: [3, 4, 3, 4, 1]\n   - Value for me:\n     - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 8 = 24\n     - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 88 = 352\n     - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 48 = 144\n     - Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 79 = 316\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 69 = 69\n   - Total value = 24 + 352 + 144 + 316 + 69 = 905\n   \nThe remaining viable configuration to achieve [3, 4, 4, 3, 2] for self allocation becomes:\n- Items for me: [3, 4, 4, 3, 2]\n- Value for me: \n  - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 8 = 24\n  - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 88 = 352 \n  - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 48 = 192\n  - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 79 = 237\n  - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 69 = 138\n  - Total value = 24 + 352 + 192 + 237 + 138 = 943 : not perfect\n\nUltimately failed, to cross 1003 mark without exceeding maximum. Hence walking is best option. \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Thus, accepting would be Mistake 4.\n\n### 3) Decision Making:\n- Since the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept it. \n- I need to propose a counteroffer that provides me with a value higher than 724. I'll structure a potential counteroffer where my retained value would exceed my outside offer.\n\n### Potential Counteroffer:\n\n- **Counteroffer:** [0, 4, 3, 3, 2] (suggest variants based on securing higher value)\n  - My Retained Portions:\n    - Item 1: 5 - 0 = 5 units\n    - Item 2: 6 - 4 = 2 units\n    - Item 3: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n    - Item 4: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n    - Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n\n- **Value Calculation:**\n  - Item 1: 5 x 50 = 250\n  - Item 2: 2 x 7 = 14\n  - Item 3: 3 x 20 = 60\n  - Item 4: 3 x 73 = 219\n  - Item 5: 2 x 68 = 136\n  - Total Value: 250 + 14 + 60 + 219 + 136 = 679\n\nThis counteroffer does not reach the value of my outside offer yet. Let's try another possibility.\n\n### Alternative Counteroffer:\n\n- **Counteroffer:** [0, 5, 4, 2, 1]\n  - My Retained Portions:\n    - Item 1: 5 units\n    - Item 2: 1 unit\n    - Item 3: 2 units\n    - Item 4: 4 units\n    - Item 5: 3 units\n\n- **Value Calculation:**\n  - Item 1: 5 x 50 = 250\n  - Item 2: 1 x 7 = 7\n  - Item 3: 2 x 20 = 40\n  - Item 4: 4 x 73 = 292\n  - Item 5: 3 x 68 = 204\n  - Total Value: 250 + 7 + 40 + 292 + 204 = 793\n\nSince this provides me with a value above my outside offer (793 > 724), it is a satisfactory counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, I will propose the counteroffer [0, 5, 4, 2, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 4, 2, 1]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 5, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 1 + 72 x 1 + 26 x 5 + 24 x 4 + 8 x 3\n    which is 351 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 352.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 19. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 951 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 0 + 86 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 8 x 2 + 94 x 0\n    which is 16 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 19. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 6, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

I\u2019ll keep iterating to propose a valid counteroffer acceptable by both parties.\n\n   Adjusting to keep more of Items 4 and 5:\n     - Keeping [2, 1, 0, 2, 3] and giving [2, 3, 3, 0, 3] to Player 1:\n   \n     - My items:\n       - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n       - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 79 = 79\n       - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 88 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n       - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 99 = 297\n       - Total value = 60 + 79 + 0 + 186 + 297 = 622\n   \n   After assessing again, rather than further adjusting, I'll walk away since potential mix further limits toplines.\n   \nEven after attempting different combinations to improve my value above 907, I'm unable to reach a satisfactory outcome.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 0 + 58 x 0 + 32 x 0 + 63 x 0 + 31 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 10. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I should aim for an offer that maximizes my total value above my outside offer (10). Let's start with calculating potential scenarios:\n\n  - Example counteroffer (keeping more valuable items):\n    - Offer 2 units of item 1\n    - Offer 1 unit of item 2\n    - Offer 0 units of item 3\n    - Offer 2 units of item 4\n    - Offer 1 unit of item 5\n    \n    By keeping the remainder, my value would be calculated as:\n    - Kept 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 17 = 68\n    - Kept 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n    - Kept 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n    - Kept 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 63 = 189\n    - Kept 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n    \n    **Total value = 68 + 174 + 64 + 189 + 31 = 526**, which is significantly higher than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision based on analysis\n\nGiven my analysis, I should propose a counteroffer to start the negotiation process. The selected counteroffer provides me with a substantial value of 526, which is preferable to my outside offer of 10.\n\nBy following the above reasoning, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 0 + 58 x 0 + 32 x 0 + 63 x 0 + 31 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 10. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 0 + 2 x 3 + 83 x 0 + 40 x 0 + 20 x 1\n    which is 26 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 28. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Therefore, my value calculations will not include the discounting effect yet.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer from Player 2, I need to come up with an initial offer or decide to walk or end negotiations. First, I will check how much value I get from keeping all items:\n\n- Keeping all items gives me the following values:\n  - 3 units of item 1: \\(3 \u00d7 14 = 42\\)\n  - 8 units of item 2: \\(8 \u00d7 2 = 16\\)\n  - 3 units of item 3: \\(3 \u00d7 83 = 249\\)\n  - 4 units of item 4: \\(4 \u00d7 40 = 160\\)\n  - 8 units of item 5: \\(8 \u00d7 20 = 160\\)\n- Total value: \\(42 + 16 + 249 + 160 + 160 = 627\\)\n\nNow consider offering a division that still gives me more than my outside offer (28):\n\nLet me calculate for an offer that respects my needs:\n\n- I keep [3, 3, 3, 1, 1] (offering the remaining to Player 2)\n  - Value: \n    - 3 units of item 1 = 42\n    - 3 units of item 2 = 6\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 249\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 40\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 20\n  - Total value: \\(42 + 6 + 249 + 40 + 20 = 357\\)\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nThe offer of keeping [3, 3, 3, 1, 1] units gives me a value of 357, far superior to my outside offer value of 28, and it respects both not offering all or none and making sure it's a beneficial first round offer.\n\nThus, my decision will be to propose this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 0, 3, 7]}\n```\n\nWhere I offer Player 2 the remaining units: 0 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 7 of item 5.",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 2, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 0 + 44 x 4 + 78 x 2 + 57 x 3 + 72 x 1\n    which is 575 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 576. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 412. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 573 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 5, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 0 + 63 x 3 + 1 x 5 + 4 x 0 + 65 x 3\n    which is 389 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 412. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 1 + 84 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 74 x 0 + 88 x 3\n    which is 305 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 320. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

If accepted in this round (round 2), no discount applies (gamma^(2-1) = gamma^1 = 0.9).\n\n2) Assess the value of the current offer:\n\n   Current offer [2, 1, 0, 0, 2] gives me:\n   - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 41 = 82\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 84 = 84\n   - 0 units of item 3: 0 * 88 = 0\n   - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 74 = 0\n   - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 88 = 176\n   - Total value = 82 + 84 + 0 + 0 + 176 = 342\n\n   With the discount for round 2 (0.9), the total effective value is 342 * 0.9 = 307.8.\n\n   Compare this with my outside offer value of 320 (which is guaranteed and not discounted).\n\n3) Decision:\n\n   The effective value of accepting the current offer (307.8) is lower than my outside offer value (320). Therefore, accepting this offer would not be beneficial.\n\n   To make a counteroffer, I need to ensure that the value is greater than 320. One potential approach is to adjust the proposed items allocated to Player 1 to better optimize my values while ensuring that it is not worse than the current situation.\n\n   Let's consider counteroffers that would give me higher value:\n\n   - I could try offering [1, 1, 2, 0, 2] to Player 1, letting me keep:\n     - 4 units of item 1: 4 * 41 = 164\n     - 3 units of item 2: 3 * 84 = 252\n     - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 88 = 264\n     - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 74 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 88 = 88\n     - Total value = 164 + 252 + 264 + 0 + 88 = 768\n\n   With this approach, my value is much higher than the current offer and my outside offer.\n\nThus, I will make the counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 0 + 95 x 1 + 78 x 2 + 88 x 0 + 34 x 1\n    which is 285 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 287. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 762. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 762. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 7, 0, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 3 + 29 x 7 + 23 x 0 + 88 x 2 + 72 x 5\n    which is 760 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 762. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 34. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 660 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 0 + 48 x 0 + 90 x 0 + 20 x 0 + 33 x 1\n    which is 33 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 34. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 4, 3, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 4, 3, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 203. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 666 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 0 + 33 x 0 + 63 x 2 + 31 x 0 + 19 x 4\n    which is 202 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 203. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 1, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    98 x 3 + 65 x 5 + 41 x 1 + 55 x 4 + 87 x 4\n    which is 1228 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1229. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 2, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

The current offer is much lower than my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - I should not accept the current offer as it is worth 727, which is less than my outside offer (1229).\n   - I should aim for a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1229.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate a potential counteroffer:\nSuppose I offer [2, 3, 1, 3, 3] (which means I keep [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]):\n   - My kept items:\n     - 2 units of item 1: \\(2 \\times 98 = 196\\)\n     - 2 units of item 2: \\(2 \\times 65 = 130\\)\n     - 1 unit of item 3: \\(1 \\times 41 = 41\\)\n     - 2 units of item 4: \\(2 \\times 55 = 110\\)\n     - 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 87 = 174\\)\n   - Total value = 196 + 130 + 41 + 110 + 174 = 651\n\nThis isn't advantageous for me as it still results in less value compared to my outside offer. I'll try another approach: [1, 1, 0, 0, 1] offered to Player 1 (meaning I would get [3, 4, 2, 5, 4]):\n  - My kept items:\n    - 3 units of item 1: \\(3 \\times 98 = 294\\)\n    - 4 units of item 2: \\(4 \\times 65 = 260\\)\n    - 2 units of item 3: \\(2 \\times 41 = 82\\)\n    - 5 units of item 4: \\(5 \\times 55 = 275\\)\n    - 4 units of item 5: \\(4 \\times 87 = 348\\)\n  - Total value = 294 + 260 + 82 + 275 + 348 = 1259\n\nThis value (1259) is better than my outside offer value of 1229.

The current offer is much lower than my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - The current offer is significantly lower than my outside offer value.\n   - Walking away would yield me the outside offer value of 1229, which is superior to the current offer's discounted value.\n   - Instead of accepting a less valuable offer, propose a counteroffer that could potentially maximize my value.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that gives Player 1 enough to incentivize them, while still maximizing my value and ensuring it's above 1229.\n\nGiven the distribution of item values, I should focus on keeping high-value items:\n\nProposed counteroffer: \n- Offer Player 1 the lower-value items and a mix that maximizes my value:\n- [1, 2, 0, 3, 2]: Offering Player 1 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n- My value:\n  - Item 1: 3 x 98 = 294\n  - Item 2: 3 x 65 = 195\n  - Item 3: 2 x 41 = 82\n  - Item 4: 2 x 55 = 110\n  - Item 5: 3 x 87 = 261\n  Total value = 294 + 195 + 82 + 110 + 261 = 942\n  After discount in Round 2, 942 * 0.9 = 847.8\n\nThis proposed counteroffer still does not reach my outside offer.\n\nWe need a better counteroffer to reach that. Let's adjust to make sure it competes with the outside offer of 1229.\n\nSo, I'll focus on maximizing more:\n\nProposed counteroffer: \n- Offer Player 1 [0, 2, 0, 2, 2], keeping [4, 3, 2, 3, 3]:\n- My value:\n  - Item 1: 4 x 98 = 392\n  - Item 2: 3 x 65 = 195\n  - Item 3: 2 x 41 = 82\n  - Item 4: 3 x 55 = 165\n  - Item 5: 3 x 87 = 261\n  Total value = 392 + 195 + 82 + 165 + 261 = 1095\n  After discount, 1095 * 0.9 = 985.5\n\nThis still doesn't reach 1229.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 118. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 666 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 1 + 86 x 0 + 8 x 1 + 29 x 1 + 19 x 0\n    which is 117 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 118. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 364. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 603 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    28 x 0 + 37 x 0 + 31 x 2 + 56 x 1 + 49 x 5\n    which is 363 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 364. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Let's calculate a potential offer's impact:\n\n   - Consider I keep all units that maximize my value, for example, all of item 5 initially:\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 58 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 55 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 31 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 54 = 0\n     - 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 96 = 576\n   \n   Total value for keeping all units of item 5 = 576, which is greater than my outside offer of 535.\n   \n   To ensure a more balanced offer, I can keep significant value, yet propose reasonable items:\n\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n   - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 31 = 124\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 54 = 108\n   - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 96 = 384\n\n   Total value = 116 + 124 + 108 + 384 = 732\n\n   By offering the remaining units of items 2 and 1 unit of item 5, I ensure a viable proposal while maximizing my outcome.\n\n3) Decision Making:\n\n   Since my value when keeping 0 units of item 2 and 4 units of item 5, and giving away items 2 and 2 units of item 5 exceeds the outside offer, it's suitable for a counteroffer.\n\nI will propose the other player receives zero units of these, achieving 732 value.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 0, 2]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 622. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 622. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 714 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 2, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 2 + 26 x 3 + 54 x 2 + 11 x 6 + 75 x 3\n    which is 621 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 622. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 622. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 714 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 2, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 2 + 26 x 3 + 54 x 2 + 11 x 6 + 75 x 3\n    which is 621 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 622. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 4, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1192. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1192. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 771 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 6, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 4 + 57 x 5 + 68 x 6 + 68 x 4 + 8 x 0\n    which is 1189 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1192. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 6, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 4 + 57 x 5 + 68 x 6 + 68 x 4 + 8 x 0\n    which is 1189 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1192. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1) **Analyzing the Current Situation:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My guaranteed fallback, or outside offer, is 1192.\n   - **Values of Items:** \n     - Item 1: 56\n     - Item 2: 57\n     - Item 3: 68\n     - Item 4: 68\n     - Item 5: 8\n   - **Total Pool of Items:** \n     - 6 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - **Discount Factor:** Since we are in round 2, accepting this round's offer would not be subjected to any discount.

Further close evaluations show that with current allocation constraints altogether, maintaining the outside offer becomes an option.\n\nGiven the difficulty in structuring an advantageous offer over 1192 within the constraints remaining, the best course of action becomes clear.\n\n**Action:** \n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Consequently, any offer that I consider should ideally be worth more than 909 to me directly.\n\n2) Assess potential counteroffers:\n   - I want to keep those items that have the highest value to me, ensuring my total is more than my outside offer value of 909.\n   - Let's start by attempting to optimize my share, keeping items with high value. For an initial attempt, I will calculate different possible allocations that maximize my interests.\n\n   For my proposal, let's consider keeping more items with a higher value (items 2, 4, and 5) and offering lower-valued items to Player 2, while still ensuring what I retain is worth more than my outside offer.\n\n   My proposed counteroffer:\n   - Offer the following to Player 2: [4, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n   - Keep for myself: [0, 3, 0, 3, 3]\n\n   Calculate the total value to me:\n   - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 23 = 0\n   - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 97 = 291\n   - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n   - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 91 = 273\n   - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n   - Total Value = 291 + 273 + 294 = 858\n\n   Since the value obtained (858) is less than my outside offer of 909, this proposal is not beneficial to me.

I'll iterate measures to provide as close to my outside offer as possible:\n\n   Final counteroffer:\n   - Offer the following to Player 2: [4, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n   - Keep for myself: [0, 3, 1, 3, 3]\n\n   Calculate total value to me:\n   - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 23 = 0\n   - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 97 = 291\n   - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n   - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 91 = 273\n   - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n   - Total Value = 291 + 3 + 273 + 294 = 861\n   \n   After revising multiple options, the counteroffers are falling short of my outside offer, making walking away seem better. We could alternatively test reducing further on high-value item retentions.\n\n   However, there seems to be severe imbalances between my outside offer stability matching. While the division calculates maximum maintain strategy, dynamic adjustments warns deterrents with high current bid value misalignment yet.\n\nUltimately with replacement allocations, fitting contend enable clauses bring lesser equity entailed to opposition engagement profits facing broader yield threshold cross.\n\nHence my concluding approach as initial moves shall turnaround versus insufficient bargaining turn.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 5, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 0 + 37 x 4 + 51 x 5 + 30 x 1 + 55 x 2\n    which is 543 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 544. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on the best course of action, let's first analyze the current situation by answering the questions provided step-by-step.\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 544.\n- **Values of Items Involved:**\n  - Item 1: 82 per unit\n  - Item 2: 37 per unit\n  - Item 3: 51 per unit\n  - Item 4: 30 per unit\n  - Item 5: 55 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 5 units\n  - Item 4: 1 unit\n  - Item 5: 2 units\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor, gamma = 0.9, applies starting from the second round (not applicable in the first round's decision since it's round 1).\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- **Current Offer Value:** There is no offer on the table currently.\n- **Potential Counteroffers:** \n  - I need to ensure the total value of my counteroffer to me exceeds my outside offer of 544.\n\nTo derive a suitable counteroffer, I will calculate my value received for keeping certain quantities of each item. Here is one potential beneficial division to consider:\n\n- Proposal: Keep [3, 1, 3, 1, 1] and give [0, 3, 2, 0, 1] to the other player.\n\n  My value:\n  - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 82 = 246\n  - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 37 = 37\n  - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 51 = 153\n  - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 30 = 30\n  - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 55 = 55\n  - Total: 246 + 37 + 153 + 30 + 55 = 521\n\nThis division is not acceptable as it is less than my outside offer. I need to adjust to make the value to me greater than 544.\n\nThus, let's propose keeping 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, and adjust other items accordingly:\n\n- New Proposal: Keep [2, 1, 5, 1, 0], giving [1, 3, 0, 0, 2] to player 2.\n\n  My value:\n  - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 82 = 164\n  - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 37 = 37\n  - Item 3: 5 units \u00d7 51 = 255\n  - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 30 = 30\n  - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 55 = 0\n  - Total: 164 + 37 + 255 + 30 + 0 = 486\n\nStill not sufficient. Let's now propose a final update that meets or exceeds my outside offer:\n\n- Final Counteroffer: Keep [3, 1, 4, 1, 0], giving [0, 3, 1, 0, 2] to player 2. \n\n  My value:\n  - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 82 = 246\n  - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 37 = 37\n  - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 51 = 204\n  - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 30 = 30\n  - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 55 = 0\n  - Total: 246 + 37 + 204 + 30 + 0 = 517\n\nIt remains just below, hence must adjust further. Ideally from this calc, we know keeping a distribution closer to high units for item3 helps. \n\nFinally, I will take a strategic approach by maximizing what is feasible for a start having reconsidered my initial attempt. \n\n**Valid Counteroffer:** Keep [3, 2, 4, 1, 0], offer [0, 2, 1, 0, 2]:\n\n  My value:\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n  - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 51 = 204\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n  - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 55 = 0\n  - Total: 246 + 74 + 204 + 30 + 0 = 554\n\nNow, my value (554) exceeds the outside offer (544), making it a valid counteroffer.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n- The counteroffer maximizes my value and is greater than my outside offer.\n- Therefore, I propose this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

However, since it's round 2 now, the discount hasn't been applied yet but should be considered if the situation heads into the final round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer to me: [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n     - Value to me:\n       - 1 unit of Item 1: 82\n       - 0 units of Item 2: 0\n       - 1 unit of Item 3: 51\n       - 0 units of Item 4: 0\n       - 0 units of Item 5: 0\n     - Total value = 82 + 51 = 133.\n\n   - Compare this to my outside offer value of 544. (This is significantly lower, and thus not acceptable)\n\n3) Consider a counteroffer:\n   - I need a counteroffer that is worth more than 544 to me if accepted.\n   - The total value of all items (my valuation) is:\n       - (3 * 82) + (4 * 37) + (5 * 51) + (1 * 30) + (2 * 55) = 789\n   - To maximize my offer above 544, I want to keep more of the high-value items like item 1 and item 3.\n   \n   Let's consider an offer where I keep most of the high-value items:\n   - Offer Player 2: [0, 4, 0, 0, 2] (I keep [3, 0, 5, 1, 0]):\n     - Value to me:\n       - 3 units of Item 1 = 246\n       - 0 units of Item 2 = 0\n       - 5 units of Item 3 = 255\n       - 1 unit of Item 4 = 30\n       - 0 units of Item 5 = 0\n     - Total value = 246 + 0 + 255 + 30 + 0 = 531.\n     - This is still below my outside offer.\n\n   A better attempt could be:\n   - Offer Player 2: [0, 3, 1, 0, 2] (I keep [3, 1, 4, 1, 0]):\n     - Value to me:\n       - 3 units of Item 1 = 246\n       - 1 units of Item 2 = 37\n       - 4 units of Item 3 = 204\n       - 1 unit of Item 4 = 30\n       - 0 units of Item 5 = 0\n     - Total value = 246 + 37 + 204 + 30 + 0 = 517.\n     - This is still below 544.\n\n   Final attempt: Ensure the sum exceeds 544:\n   - Offer Player 2: [2, 3, 1, 0, 0] (I keep [1, 1, 4, 1, 2]):\n     - Value to me:\n       - 1 unit of Item 1 = 82\n       - 1 unit of Item 2 = 37\n       - 4 units of Item 3 = 204\n       - 1 unit of Item 4 = 30\n       - 2 units of Item 5 = 110\n     - Total value = 82 + 37 + 204 + 30 + 110 = 463.\n\nEach attempt doesn't seem to exceed 544 due to the constraints. Optimizing to see if I can keep more yet won't surpass my outside offer value with available calculations.\n\nBased on this scenario, it becomes optimal to **WALK** if no acceptable offer is feasible against my calculated value and the round goes into a stalemate of less yield.\n\nChoosing to **WALK** seems a rational recourse given the options:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 239. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 741 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 0 + 3 x 2 + 20 x 3 + 86 x 2 + 50 x 0\n    which is 238 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 239. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 78. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 876 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 0 + 64 x 0 + 18 x 0 + 38 x 2 + 97 x 0\n    which is 76 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 78. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's go through the decision-making process step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n   - **My Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 78.\n   - **Item Values (Private to Me):**\n     - Item 1: 75\n     - Item 2: 64\n     - Item 3: 18\n     - Item 4: 38\n     - Item 5: 97\n   - **Total Pool of Items:** \n     - 7 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n   - **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (\\(\\gamma = 0.9\\)) will affect the value received from the negotiation. Given it is round 1, there is no discount yet but waiting for future offers would multiply the effective value by the discount factor.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   Since there is no current offer, let's consider a potential counteroffer considering my outside offer value.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffer 1:** Keep most valuable items, offer remaining.\n     - Proposal: Offer Player 2 [2, 1, 4, 3, 0] (keeping [5, 2, 0, 0, 1] for myself).\n     - Calculation of retained items:\n       - 5 units of item 1 = \\(5 \\times 75 = 375\\)\n       - 2 units of item 2 = \\(2 \\times 64 = 128\\)\n       - 0 units of item 3 = \\(0 \\times 18 = 0\\)\n       - 0 units of item 4 = \\(0 \\times 38 = 0\\)\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = \\(1 \\times 97 = 97\\)\n     - **Total Value:** \\(375 + 128 + 0 + 0 + 97 = 600\\), which is significantly higher than the outside option of 78.\n\n   This counteroffer ensures I keep a significant value from the items.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   Given the calculations, proposing a counteroffer that gives me a total value of 600 is much better than taking my outside offer value of 78. It is important I refrain from offering all items or none, and also, the proposal ensures the value is higher than my fallback option. Therefore, I will proceed with a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 4, 3, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 5, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 0 + 40 x 0 + 16 x 2 + 6 x 5 + 40 x 5\n    which is 262 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 263. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

However, as we are in Round 1, it doesn't yet impact the comparison against the outside offer.\n\n2) **Assessing the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer Value:** \n     - Current offer to me is [0, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n     - My value from this is: \n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 16 = 16\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n     - Total value of this offer = 16.\n   - This offer is significantly less than my outside offer of 263.\n   - **Formulating a Counteroffer:**\n     - I need to propose a division that gives me more than my outside offer value.\n     - Since I can only propose better offers than my outside offer, let's analyze a few possibilities:\n       - If I keep [4, 2, 1, 3, 3], giving them [0, 0, 6, 2, 2]:\n         - Value to me = 4\u00d777 + 2\u00d740 + 1\u00d716 + 3\u00d76 + 3\u00d740 = 308 + 80 + 16 + 18 + 120 = 542.\n       - This proposal offers substantial value over my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - The current offer is far below my outside offer value, so accepting it is not preferable.\n   - Walking away would guarantee me 263, but I can do better with the counteroffer.\n   - I will propose the counteroffer [0, 0, 6, 2, 2] to Player 1, which ensures a value higher than my outside offer.\n\nGiven this analysis, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 6, 2, 2]}\n```",

Since we are in round 2, if we reach round 3, any value I calculate will be multiplied by \\(0.9^{1} = 0.9\\).\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - Current offer on the table: [0, 0, 6, 2, 2]\n     - My share (remaining items): [4, 2, 1, 3, 3]\n     - Value to me:\n       - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 87 = 348\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 84 = 84\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n       - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180\n       - Total value = 348 + 106 + 84 + 186 + 180 = 904\n\n   Compare this value of 904 against my outside offer of 1509.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 365. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 759 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 3, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 2 + 77 x 0 + 88 x 3 + 77 x 1 + 2 x 2\n    which is 363 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 365. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 1, 4, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    78 x 7 + 23 x 1 + 13 x 4 + 56 x 1 + 38 x 2\n    which is 753 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 754. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 1 + 12 x 2 + 97 x 0 + 50 x 0 + 84 x 3\n    which is 347 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 348. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Therefore, I need to make an initial offer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 143.\n\n   Let's calculate different potential scenarios:\n\n   - If I propose to keep all units of the high-value items (items 3 and 4) and split the lower-value ones:\n\n     For example, a division like keeping 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 for me, and offering the rest to Player 2:\n\n     - Value of items for me:\n       - Item 1: 5 \u00d7 60 = 300\n       - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 44 = 44\n       - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n       - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n       - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     \n     Total value for me = 300 + 44 + 279 + 129 + 14 = 766\n\n     Since 766 is greater than 143, this offer would be more valuable to me than my outside option.\n\n3. **Make a Decision:**\n\n   The calculation shows that if I keep the suggested items, the value is much greater than my outside option, ensuring I avoid any mistakes such as offering worse for me than my outside offer or accepting a worse deal.\n\n   I will propose offering Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\n   - {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 3, 3]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Since it's round 1, the discount factor doesn't reduce the value yet, but it will if negotiations extend to later rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer Value**: There is no current offer to assess.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - I'll start by considering a scenario that ensures the value to me is more than my outside offer of 544. I need a division where the calculated value is greater than 544 to make it worthwhile, compared to just leaving with my outside offer.\n\nLet's calculate the value for different divisions:\n  - Proposal: Offer Player 2 [4, 1, 1, 2, 3]. This means I keep [4, 1, 2, 3, 3].\n\n  Calculating value:\n  - Keep 4 units of item 1: \\( 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\)\n  - Keep 1 unit of item 2: \\( 1 \\times 35 = 35 \\)\n  - Keep 2 units of item 3: \\( 2 \\times 33 = 66 \\)\n  - Keep 3 units of item 4: \\( 3 \\times 87 = 261 \\)\n  - Keep 3 units of item 5: \\( 3 \\times 50 = 150 \\)\n\n  Total Value: \\( 240 + 35 + 66 + 261 + 150 = 752 \\)\n\n752 is greater than my outside offer of 544, so this offer is reasonable under the assumption it might not be optimal for Player 2, but it ensures I maximize my value above my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nFollowing the strategic consideration:\n- Since there's no existing offer to accept, and walking away gives me 544, a counteroffer with a value of 752 is beneficial as it maintains a good stance.\n- I aim to avoid Mistakes 1, 2, and 5 by ensuring my offer is better than my outside offer and equitably beneficial as a proposal.\n\nThus, my next step is to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 1, 2, 3]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 2, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 3 + 16 x 2 + 92 x 2 + 87 x 3 + 77 x 5\n    which is 925 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 926. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

I'll adjust my counteroffer to make it slightly better:\n\n- Offer [1, 0, 2, 0, 1] and keep [5, 2, 0, 4, 1]\n\n- Adjusted calculation:\n  - Item 1: 5 * 64 = 320\n  - Item 2: 2 * 22 = 44\n  - Item 3: 0 * 9 = 0\n  - Item 4: 4 * 70 = 280\n  - Item 5: 1 * 80 = 80\n\n  Total value = 320 + 44 + 0 + 280 + 80 = 724\n  \nStill below the outside offer.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 462. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 462. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 0, 1, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 5 + 66 x 0 + 10 x 1 + 57 x 1 + 92 x 2\n    which is 461 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 462. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 226. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 822 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 0 + 37 x 2 + 84 x 0 + 33 x 3 + 26 x 2\n    which is 225 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 226. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Thus, this offer aligns with my objective to surpass the outside offer value.\n\nHere's the counteroffer in terms of items given to Player 2:\n- [0, 2, 0, 0, 3]\n\nThis counteroffer ensures I am getting a better outcome than the outside offer, and provides a substantial amount of items to Player 2 too.\n\nThus, my action is as follows:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 3]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 803. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 507 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 3, 4, 5, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 5 + 44 x 3 + 28 x 4 + 15 x 5 + 35 x 7\n    which is 799 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 803. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Accepting it would be a mistake compared to walking away with a guaranteed value of 803. Thus, I should either propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer or choose to walk away.\n\nI will now calculate a potential counteroffer where I aim to ensure my total value exceeds 803.\n\n### Calculating a Counteroffer\nTo exceed my outside offer of 803, I need to propose an allocation that leaves me with items of at least a value of 804 or more.\n\nLet's start by trying to keep most of the high-value units for myself. Here is a possible allocation leftover approach:\n\n- Keep all 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 47 = 235\n- Keep 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 44 = 44\n- Keep 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 28 = 112\n- Keep 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 15 = 75\n- Keep 5 units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 35 = 175\n\nTotal Value I Keep: 235 + 44 + 112 + 75 + 175 = 641\n\nThis value does not exceed my outside offer. Therefore, let's try adjusting it:\n\n- Adjust to keep 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 44 = 220\n- Adjust to give, instead: all of the item 4, free some lower value item 1\n- Keep allocation closer to item 1 surplus.\n\nRevised approach due mathematical breakdown:\n\n- Counteroffer: Give most lower value items, keep higher crucial balanced offset upwards toward 804.\n\nAfter various retries \u2014 If final adjusted value proposition from my suggested counter offers ultimately cannot reach 804:\nAs third methods with iterations indicate \u2014 if failure, select: {\"action\": \"WALK\"} indicating benefit threshold isn\u2019t met convincingly.",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 81 x 2 + 35 x 3 + 10 x 3 + 41 x 1\n    which is 338 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 339. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

We can check if keeping more items gives me even better value, but I must ensure a better return than my fallback option.\n\nLet's calculate a potential maximum value for me: If I keep all the items myself, I get:\n   - 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 54 = 216\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 100 = 100\n   - 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 88 = 440\n   - 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 77 = 385\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 59 = 0\n   - **Total Maximum Value**: 216 + 100 + 440 + 385 = 1141\n\nAll-above evaluations indicate that the current offer already proposes a good value (219 > 18), while strategizing a different or more withholding counteroffer would potentially improve my stand but requires careful negotiation.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- Given the current offer provides a significantly higher value than my outside offer and is advantageous in ensuring the negotiation doesn't prematurely conclude unfavorably, it's reasonable to **ACCEPT** this offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 6, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 0 + 26 x 2 + 32 x 1 + 29 x 6 + 64 x 1\n    which is 322 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 323. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

My potential counteroffer must give me a total value greater than my outside offer of 323.\n\n3) Calculate a Reasonable Counteroffer:\n   - If I were to keep a significant portion of the items to maximize my value while still giving a realistic offer, it could look like this: keep a majority, especially of high-value items to me, and offer some proportion of each category to Player 2.\n   \n   Let's consider I keep:\n   - 3 units of item 1\n   - 2 units of item 2\n   - 2 units of item 3\n   - 5 units of item 4\n   - 1 unit of item 5\n   \n   Offering Player 2 the rest would mean:\n   - [2, 2, 2, 1, 1] offered to Player 2.\n\n   Calculating my value:\n   - My remaining units:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n     - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 29 = 145\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n   - Total value = 123 + 52 + 64 + 145 + 64 = 448\n\n   This value (448) is greater than my outside offer (323), ensuring I am not making Mistake 2.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 0 + 48 x 1 + 74 x 0 + 38 x 0 + 7 x 0\n    which is 48 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 53. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 723. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 621 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 0, 5, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 5 + 13 x 0 + 53 x 5 + 1 x 0 + 81 x 2\n    which is 722 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 723. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 0, 5, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 6, 0, 5, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine my action, let's evaluate the current situation using the provided steps:\n\n1) Analyzing the current situation:\n\n   - My outside offer value is 723.\n   - The values of the items for me are:\n     - Item 1: 59\n     - Item 2: 13\n     - Item 3: 53\n     - Item 4: 1\n     - Item 5: 81\n   - The total pool of items available to divide is:\n     - 8 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor influences the present value of future offers. A lower discounted value could result if negotiations are prolonged, due to the gamma factor of 0.9.\n\n2) Assessing the value of the current offer:\n\n   - Current offer to me: [0, 6, 0, 5, 2]\n   - Calculating my total value for accepting this offer:\n     - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 59 = 0\n     - Item 2: 6 units \u00d7 13 = 78\n     - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 53 = 0\n     - Item 4: 5 units \u00d7 1 = 5\n     - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 81 = 162\n     - Total value = 0 + 78 + 0 + 5 + 162 = 245\n\n   The value of this current offer to me is 245, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 723.\n\n3) Making a decision:\n\n   - Accepting the current offer would yield a value of 245, which is lower than my outside offer, and thus is not acceptable.\n   - Walking away would guarantee me a value of 723.\n   - It's reasonable to propose a counteroffer that gives me a higher value than my outside offer and is competitive in the negotiation.\n\n   Let's consider a counteroffer where I attempt to maximize my high-value items while ensuring it exceeds the outside offer value:\n\n   I would want to keep mostly high value items for me, such as item 1 and item 5. The proposed counteroffer values for Player 1 would be any configuration that reduces my side to just above 723. I need to ensure my proposal does not violate Mistakes 2 or 3 and is strategic enough considering Player 1 would like a higher return compared to their outside offer.\n\n   Upon trial and adjustment, let me propose the optimal counteroffer based on the pool of items:\n\n   - Offer Player 1: [6, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n   - Keeping: [2, 6, 5, 4, 2] \n\n   Verification of value for me for keeping: \n   - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 59 = 118\n   - Item 2: 6 units \u00d7 13 = 78\n   - Item 3: 5 units \u00d7 53 = 265\n   - Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 1 = 4\n   - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 81 = 162\n   - Total = 118 + 78 + 265 + 4 + 162 = 627 (unacceptable proposal, value less than 723, invalid step)\n\n   I need to iterate until I achieve a value above the outside offer. Each scenario fails to meet the criteria within my allowable bounds under the above player offer due equality so let us consider max units per valued item:\n\n   Let me reevaluate as evidence does not concurs to making a counteroffer exceeding outside offer without breaching above offer value steps. Walking appears most strategic currently:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 887. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 921 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 2, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 3 + 86 x 3 + 43 x 2 + 27 x 3 + 79 x 3\n    which is 878 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 887. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I should propose a counteroffer that can potentially maximize my value considering the discount factor.\n\nBased on my offer assessment and current situation, I can improve on my position by offering a split where I still get more value than the degraded outside offer value I would get if we go to the final round.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 2, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 3 + 86 x 3 + 43 x 2 + 27 x 3 + 79 x 3\n    which is 878 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 887. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's try a different allocation.\n\n#### Proposed Counteroffer: [0, 5, 1, 0, 1] (Giving these to Player 2)\n- **Units I keep:**\n  - Item 1: 3\n  - Item 2: 2\n  - Item 3: 2\n  - Item 4: 1\n  - Item 5: 3\n\n- **My value calculation:**\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 16 = 32\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n\n  Total Value = 144 + 32 + 186 + 82 + 135 = 579 \n\nThis is still less than 660. Need a more favorable allocation.\n\n#### Proposed Counteroffer: [0, 6, 0, 0, 1] (Giving these to Player 2)\n- **Units I keep:**\n  - Item 1: 3\n  - Item 2: 1\n  - Item 3: 3\n  - Item 4: 1\n  - Item 5: 3\n\n- **My value calculation:**\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n  - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 16 = 16\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n\n  Total Value = 144 + 16 + 279 + 82 + 135 = 656\n\nThis is just nearing the requirement. Let's look for a slightly more optimized division.\n\n### Step 3: Decide Action\nGiven the difficulty in finding a counteroffer reasonably greater than 660, while maintaining fairness, I decide to propose the following division:\n\n#### Final Proposed Counteroffer: [0, 7, 0, 0, 2] (Offering these to Player 2)\n- **Units I keep:**\n  - Item 1: 3\n  - Item 2: 0\n  - Item 3: 3\n  - Item 4: 1\n  - Item 5: 2\n\n- **My value calculation:**\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n  - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 16 = 0\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n  - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n\n  Total Value = 144 + 0 + 279 + 82 + 90 = 595\n\nEven this reasonable counteroffer would be very close to the outside value. In reality, a greater optimization should be applicable by any alpha-matching opponent player to reach fairness before situation exacerbates.\n\nUltimately, I must walk away if such difficulty continues without proper optimization to only leave sufficient remaining reliability with each end-player of this simplified logical optimization when any abrupt disfavor could arise during any negotiation turn-left.",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 257. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 603 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 0 + 14 x 0 + 6 x 0 + 50 x 4 + 56 x 1\n    which is 256 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 257. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 505. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 633 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 0 + 48 x 2 + 56 x 0 + 27 x 2 + 59 x 6\n    which is 504 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 505. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Let's calculate the potential values for some divisions:\n\n  1. **Example Counteroffer**:\n     - Give away: [1 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5]\n     - I keep: [3, 4, 1, 3, 3]\n     - My Value:\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63\n       - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81\n       - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n     - Total value = 569\n\n  Since 569 is greater than my outside offer of 505, this counteroffer is better than accepting the outside offer. \n\n### 3) Make a decision:\nI should make a counteroffer that maximizes my value while being mindful of not offering too much to Player 2, ensuring my offer remains better than my outside alternative.\n\n  **Proposed Counteroffer:**\n  - [1, 3, 0, 3, 4] items offered to Player 2.\n\nTherefore, my action is: \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 3, 4]}\n```",

Currently, the value isn't adjusted by gamma since it's the first round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There's no current offer to accept or reject.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that provides a total value greater than my outside offer value of 96.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I'll calculate a reasonable allocation that exceeds my outside offer value:\n\nLet's try proposing an offer that allows me to keep items which provide the highest value:\n\n- I should try to keep items with the highest unit values: Items 3, 4, and 5. \n\nLet me calculate the value if I keep all of item 4 (3 units) and some units of high-value items like item 5 and others, then propose the rest:\n\n- Proposal for Player 2: Give away all of item 1, all of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nSo the proposed offer to Player 2 would be [3, 7, 3, 0, 3].\n\n**My Value Keeping:**\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 24 = 0\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\n- 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 98 = 490\n- Total value = 0 + 0 + 222 + 282 + 490 = 994\n\nSince 994 is significantly higher than my outside offer value of 96, this is a superior proposition for me compared to walking away. Thus, I will counteroffer this allocation to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 7, 3, 0, 3]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 7, 5, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 0 + 92 x 7 + 27 x 5 + 45 x 2 + 8 x 4\n    which is 901 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 902. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's calculate my total value if I accept this offer:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 92 = 92\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 59 = 0\n     - Total value = 136 + 92 + 1 + 63 + 0 = 292\n   - The current offer's value (292) is less than my outside offer value of 560.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The current offer's value to me (292) is significantly lower than my outside offer (560). Accepting it would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away is an option since my outside offer is better than the current offer.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer: To ensure the counteroffer provides me with better value than my outside offer, I need to outline a division where my total value is greater than 560. Let's see if I can make a counteroffer that will satisfy this:\n\n   - Counteroffer proposal: If I keep 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, and 2 units of item 4, and give Player 1 the rest ([0, 1, 1, 4, 0]):\n     - Value for me: \n       - 4 \u00d7 68 + 2 \u00d7 92 + 1 \u00d7 1 + 2 \u00d7 21 + 0 \u00d7 59 = 272 + 184 + 1 + 42 + 0 = 499\n\nThis proposal, keeping 499 as my value, doesn't reach the necessary cutoff, exceeding 560, however, I can disregard Item 1 entirely and provide player 1 with the current offer except for the entirety of item 1.\n\nConsequently, for the next counteroffer proposal, I propose keeping the whole of the item 1 which will spike the value above 560 but not exceed it excessively, to the end goal of encouraging Player 1 to accept a deal with the least offer I can provide:\n\n- New Counteroffer if I significantly limit distribution (let's say; [0, 1, 1, 4, 0]): \n- This will give me: \n   - 4 \u00d7 68 + 2 \u00d7 92 + 1 \u00d7 1 + 2 \u00d7 21 + 0 \u00d7 59 = 272 + 184 + 1 + 42 + 0 = 499\n  \nThe above conclusion needs to appropriately look at my counteroffer. Adjusting a counteroffer that remains outside any worse than walking away, let me provide the offer not recognized worse in alternatives: \n\nMy finalized counteroffer will consider this approach, attempting value beyond the currently given points while considering practical distribution adjustments, producing a more certain acceptance horizon.:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 4, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 504. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 504 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 11 x 1 + 3 x 4 + 100 x 3 + 45 x 4\n    which is 503 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 504. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's analyze the current scenario step-by-step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 504.\n   - The values of the items to me are:\n     - Item 1: 9 per unit\n     - Item 2: 11 per unit\n     - Item 3: 3 per unit\n     - Item 4: 100 per unit\n     - Item 5: 45 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is [2, 3, 5, 4, 4].\n   - The discount factor, gamma, influences the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers because the value decreases by a factor of 0.9 for each additional round. Therefore, the adjusted outside offer value for future rounds is 504 * 0.9^0 = 504 in the current round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer to me: [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n     - Value if I accept: \n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 11 = 11\n       - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 100 = 100\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n     - Total value = 0 + 11 + 6 + 100 + 45 = 162\n\n   - My outside offer value is 504, which is significantly higher than the value of the current offer. \n\n   - Potential counteroffer: I need to find a division that results in a value higher than 504 for me.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Accepting the current offer would result in a value (162) that is less than my outside offer (504). Therefore, I should not ACCEPT.\n   - Walking away would guarantee me 504, which is more beneficial than accepting the current offer.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that maximizes the value for me while being acceptable to Player 1.\n\nFinding a suitable counteroffer:\n\nLet's try different divisions keeping in mind that I need a value greater than 504:\n\n- Let's propose a counteroffer: [2, 2, 3, 1, 0] for Player 1.\n- My items: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] (pool minus offer to Player 1).\n- Calculate my value:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 11 = 11\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n  - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 45 = 180\n- Total value = 0 + 11 + 6 + 300 + 180 = 497\n\n497 is still below my outside offer of 504, let's adjust it:\n\nRevised counteroffer: [2, 1, 3, 1, 0]\n- My items: [0, 2, 2, 3, 4].\n\nLet's calculate my value again:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n  - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 45 = 180\n- Total value = 0 + 22 + 6 + 300 + 180 = 508\n\nNow the total (508) is slightly more than my outside offer of 504. This counteroffer provides me a higher value than my outside offer.\n\nGiven these calculations, I'll propose the counteroffer: [2, 1, 3, 1, 0]\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 1, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 5, 1, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 2 + 97 x 5 + 46 x 1 + 27 x 2 + 52 x 0\n    which is 599 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 602. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 7, 1, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 7, 1, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 3, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1394. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1083 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 3, 5, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 7 + 87 x 3 + 79 x 5 + 39 x 2 + 62 x 0\n    which is 1392 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1394. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make a decision on my action, I will walk through the steps outlined:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1252.\n   - My private values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 19\n     - Item 2: 75\n     - Item 3: 4\n     - Item 4: 88\n     - Item 5: 85\n   - The total pool of items consists of:\n     - 6 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 7 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor gamma is 0.9, meaning that if I delay acceptance of a deal that is beneficial, my payoff will be reduced in subsequent rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Since there is no current offer from Player 2, I will need to consider potential counteroffers.\n   - I need to ensure my proposed offer yields a value greater than my outside offer value of 1252 to make a counteroffer viable.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   I will start by calculating various potential distributions, starting by keeping the higher-valued items. Considering my item values, items 2, 4, and 5 have the highest utility for me. I will keep most of these items for maximum value.\n\n   Let's consider keeping:\n   - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n   - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 75 = 300\n   - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n   - 6 units of item 4: 6 \u00d7 88 = 528\n   - 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 85 = 340\n\n   Total value = 19 + 300 + 0 + 528 + 340 = 1187\n\n   1187 is less than my outside offer of 1252, so I'll adjust by decreasing units offered of the higher-valued items:\n\n   Keep:\n   - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 19 = 0\n   - 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 75 = 375\n   - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n   - 6 units of item 4: 6 \u00d7 88 = 528\n   - 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 85 = 340\n\n   New Total value = 0 + 375 + 0 + 528 + 340 = 1243\n\n   Still slightly less, so modify further:\n\n   Keep:\n   - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 19 = 0\n   - 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 75 = 375\n   - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n   - 7 units of item 4: 7 \u00d7 88 = 616\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 85 = 0\n\n   New Total value = 0 + 375 + 0 + 616 + 0 = 991\n\n   I've erred here as the value decreased with my modified offer. Another iteration:\n\n   Keep:\n   - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n   - 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 75 = 375\n   - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n   - 7 units of item 4: 7 \u00d7 88 = 616\n   - 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 85 = 340\n\n   New Total value = 19 + 375 + 0 + 616 + 340 = 1350\n\n   This is more than my outside offer, so I will propose the following counteroffer for Player 2:\n   \n   Give Player 2 the remaining items:\n   - 5 units of item 1\n   - 0 units of item 2\n   - 2 units of item 3\n   - 0 units of item 4\n   - 0 units of item 5\n\nThus, I propose the following action as a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

However, the discount factor would apply in the next round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer Value to Me ([5, 0, 1, 3, 2]):**\n  - Item 1: 5 units \u00d7 19 = 95\n  - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 75 = 0\n  - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 4 = 4\n  - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 88 = 264\n  - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 85 = 170\n  - Total Value = 95 + 0 + 4 + 264 + 170 = 533\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 533, which is significantly lower than my outside offer value of 1252.\n\n- **Possible Counteroffer:** I need a counteroffer that gives me a value higher than 1252. \n\nFor example: Let's consider keeping [0, 5, 2, 6, 0] and offering [6, 0, 0, 1, 4]:\n\n  - Total value if I keep [0, 5, 2, 6, 0]\n    - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 19 = 0\n    - Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 75 = 375\n    - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n    - Item 4: 6 units \u00d7 88 = 528\n    - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 85 = 0\n    - Total Value = 0 + 375 + 8 + 528 + 0 = 911\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer, so this wouldn't be a good counteroffer. I need to iterate more to find something better.\n\nFor simplicity, let's try keeping [0, 5, 2, 7, 0] and offering [6, 0, 0, 0, 4]:\n\n  - Total value if I keep [0, 5, 2, 7, 0]\n    - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 19 = 0\n    - Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 75 = 375\n    - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n    - Item 4: 7 units \u00d7 88 = 616\n    - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 85 = 0\n    - Total Value = 0 + 375 + 8 + 616 + 0 = 999\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer.\n\nGiven that finding such a combination that maximizes my value and surpasses the outside offer value is becoming challenging, perhaps because of the constraints of values I cannot exceed with the current distribution possibilities, I will need to adjust my approach.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince any attempts at a counteroffer yield a value significantly lower than my outside offer, and since the current offer on the table also yields a value much lower than my outside offer, I opt for walking away, as it's a rational choice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 7, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 1, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 1 + 34 x 2 + 43 x 1 + 66 x 1 + 97 x 1\n    which is 293 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 294. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Thus, earlier agreements (first round) are more valuable to both parties.\n\n2) **Assessing the Value of Offers:**\n   - Currently, there is no offer on the table, so I need to consider potential counteroffers. \n   - I will evaluate a few possible offers:\n       - **Offer [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] to Player 2:**\n         - My share: [3, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n         - My value: \\(3 \\times 19 + 1 \\times 34 + 1 \\times 43 + 2 \\times 66 + 1 \\times 97 = 57 + 34 + 43 + 132 + 97 = 363\\)\n       - **Offer [0, 2, 0, 1, 1] to Player 2:**\n         - My share: [3, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n         - My value: \\(3 \\times 19 + 0 \\times 34 + 1 \\times 43 + 2 \\times 66 + 1 \\times 97 = 57 + 0 + 43 + 132 + 97 = 329\\)  \n         \n   - Since only the first proposed offer yields a value higher than my outside offer, it is logical to consider offering it.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that gives me a value higher than my outside offer of 294, without making it too unreasonable for Player 2 to consider.\n   - **Counteroffer [0, 2, 1, 0, 2]** gives Player 2 all items of type 2 and 5 and receiving everything else keeps my total value above 294\n\n   After iterating and evaluating, I've decided on a counteroffer that would provide me with a value higher than my outside offer without being extreme:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 826. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1293 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 0 + 67 x 3 + 95 x 0 + 81 x 4 + 100 x 3\n    which is 825 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 826. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

Try 3rd arrangement.\n\nKeep more of item 5 and propose [1, 0, 2, 2, 3] to achieve more than 826:\n\nValue if I keep [1, 3, 1, 3, 2]:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 88 = 88\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 95 = 95\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 100 = 200\n\n**Total value = 88 + 201 + 95 + 243 + 200 = 827**\n\nFinally, for round 1, this offer is slightly better than my outside offer value of 826.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on Analysis\nSince I need a counteroffer more than my outside offer value, and avoid sensible mistakes:\n\n**Counteroffer** with our new calculated potential.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 2, 3]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 457. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 5, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    83 x 2 + 61 x 0 + 9 x 5 + 54 x 4 + 29 x 1\n    which is 456 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 457. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I must maximize my value while ensuring it is greater than my outside offer value of 919.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Since there\u2019s no current offer from Player 2, I will start by proposing an offer that gives me high value while ensuring Player 2 has some value to potentially agree to it.\n\nLet's calculate a potential offer:\n\nI will commence by retaining high-value items:\n\n- Retain all 4 of item 2 (4 * 98 = 392)\n- Retain all 5 of item 4 (5 * 94 = 470)\n- Retain 3 of item 3 (3 * 54 = 162)\n- Offer the remaining items to Player 2, especially those with low individual value to me.\n\nCalculating the total value for me:\n\n- Value from items retained:\n  - 0 units of item 1: 0 * 14 = 0\n  - 4 units of item 2: 4 * 98 = 392\n  - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 54 = 162\n  - 5 units of item 4: 5 * 94 = 470\n  - 0 units of item 5: 0 * 2 = 0\n- Total value = 0 + 392 + 162 + 470 + 0 = 1024\n\nThis proposed retention value is greater than my outside offer value of 919.\n\nTherefore, the counteroffer to Player 2 will be:\n\n- Offer all 6 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 4 of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and all 5 units of item 5\n\nThis aligns with the negotiation objective by maintaining my total value above my outside offer. \n\nHere's my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 0, 4, 0, 5]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 250. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1065 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 1 + 32 x 3 + 97 x 0 + 69 x 1 + 73 x 0\n    which is 249 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 250. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [6, 0, 4, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [6, 0, 4, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

After this round, the present value will be multiplied by \\( \\gamma \\), affecting the decision to delay further.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer from Player 2:**  \n   - Keeping 1 unit of item 3: \\( 1 \\times 54 = 54 \\)  \n   - Keeping 1 unit of item 4: \\( 1 \\times 78 = 78 \\)  \n   - Total value from accepting: \\( 54 + 78 = 132 \\)  \n   Since this is greater than my outside offer of 42, it's a plausible consideration.\n\n2. **My Initial Counteroffer in Round 1:**  \n   - Kept: [1, 2, 2, 6, 2] (i.e., offered [1, 2, 1, 3, 2] to Player 2)\n   - Value of keeping:  \n     \\( 1 \\times 73 + 2 \\times 42 + 2 \\times 54 + 6 \\times 78 + 2 \\times 73 = 662 \\)  \n   This gives a significantly higher value than my outside offer.\n\n3. **Potential Counteroffers:**  \n   - To ensure a value better than my outside offer, I can propose an offer where I keep more valuable items compared to the current offer.\n   - Assessing a possible offer might include giving slightly fewer units (that offer no less than 42 in value).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- Since I have a current offer that provides 132 in value (better than both my outside offer and potential future discounted values in the next round), accepting the current offer seems optimal.\n- Proposing another counteroffer risks more rounds, where values are discounted.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGiven the current circumstances where the presented offer exceeds my outside offer and aligns with my objectives, accepting it now prevents risk from discounting in the next round.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 2, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    98 x 4 + 18 x 2 + 78 x 2 + 45 x 6 + 13 x 2\n    which is 880 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 881. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 1, 7, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 1, 7, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's propose giving items to Player 2, maximizing what I keep to ensure my value is higher than the outside offer of 1636.\n   - Aim to keep items, ensuring value exceeds the outside offer:\n     - Example: I keep [7, 2, 7, 4, 2] items. Let's calculate its value:\n       - 7 units of item 1 = 7 \u00d7 68 = 476\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n       - 7 units of item 3 = 7 \u00d7 52 = 364\n       - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 100 = 400\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n     - Total value = 1542, which is less than my outside offer of 1636.\n     - Adjust the numbers to get above 1636. Now, I keep [7, 2, 8, 4, 2] items:\n       - 7 units of item 1 = 7 \u00d7 68 = 476\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n       - 8 units of item 3 = 8 \u00d7 52 = 416\n       - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 100 = 400\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n     - Total value = 1594, still less.\n     - Adjust further, keeping [7, 3, 8, 4, 2] items:\n       - 7 units of item 1 = 7 \u00d7 68 = 476\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n       - 8 units of item 3 = 8 \u00d7 52 = 416\n       - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 100 = 400\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n     - Total value = 1692, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n   Since my calculated value is now above my outside offer, I can propose the division that offers Player 2 the remaining items.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Since I've ensured a proposal that values higher than my outside offer, I'll proceed with the counteroffer that leaves me [7, 3, 8, 4, 2] and offers Player 2 the complement [0, 2, 1, 1, 0].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 695. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 870 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 3, 0, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 1 + 100 x 0 + 12 x 3 + 48 x 0 + 88 x 7\n    which is 694 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 695. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, we need to carefully analyze the current situation.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 695.\n- **Values of the items:**\n  - Item 1: 42\n  - Item 2: 100\n  - Item 3: 12\n  - Item 4: 48\n  - Item 5: 88\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - Item 1: 2 units\n  - Item 2: 6 units\n  - Item 3: 4 units\n  - Item 4: 4 units\n  - Item 5: 8 units\n- **Discount factor:** There's a discount rate of gamma = 0.9, which applies if we proceed to further rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n#### Current Offer from Player 1:\n- Current offer on the table: [0, 0, 1, 4, 1]\n- Units I receive: [2, 6, 3, 0, 7] (This is what remains if I accept the current offer)\n- Calculating my value for this current offer:\n  - Item 1: 2 units x 42 = 84\n  - Item 2: 6 units x 100 = 600\n  - Item 3: 3 units x 12 = 36\n  - Item 4: 0 units x 48 = 0\n  - Item 5: 7 units x 88 = 616\n  - Total value = 84 + 600 + 36 + 0 + 616 = 1336\n\n#### Comparison:\n- My value from the current offer (1336) is substantially higher than my outside offer (695).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- Accept the current offer since its value to me (1336) is greater than my outside offer (695).

Let's try:\n     - Offer Player 1: [5, 0, 2, 0, 3]\n     - This means I keep: [5, 5, 4, 1, 1] (calculated by subtracting my offer from the total items).\n     - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n     - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 38 = 190\n     - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 60 = 240\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 37 = 37\n     - Total value = 40 + 190 + 240 + 53 + 37 = 560\n   \n   - This counteroffer ensures my kept value (560) is above my outside offer (409), aligning with my objective to maximize my payoff.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 2, 0, 3]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 0 + 7 x 3 + 76 x 1 + 42 x 0 + 18 x 2\n    which is 133 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 134. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 7, 2, 0, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    61 x 0 + 75 x 7 + 5 x 2 + 81 x 0 + 45 x 8\n    which is 895 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 896. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on my initial offer, I will first analyze the situation and then determine a possible counteroffer that maximizes my value while avoiding common negotiation mistakes.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1) **My Outside Offer Value:**\n   - 896\n\n2) **Values of the Items Involved:**\n   - Item 1: 61\n   - Item 2: 75\n   - Item 3: 5\n   - Item 4: 81\n   - Item 5: 45\n\n3) **Total Pool of Items:**\n   - 4 units of item 1\n   - 7 units of item 2\n   - 5 units of item 3\n   - 2 units of item 4\n   - 8 units of item 5\n\n4) **Discount Factor:**\n   - Gamma = 0.9 (but since this is round 1, no discount has applied yet unless we move to future rounds)\n\n### Strategy Consideration\n\n- My goal is to get a division of items that gives me a value higher than my outside offer value of 896.\n- I should focus on keeping more items that have higher value to me, such as items 4 and 2.\n- I will ensure the total value of what I keep is higher than 896.\n\n### Offer Calculation\n\nTo maximize my outcome, I will consider offering a division that appears fair to the other party but retains enough high-value items for myself. Let's try:\n\n1) Keep more of item 2 and item 4, as they give high returns:\n   - Keep 1 unit of item 1\n   - Keep 3 units of item 2\n   - Keep 1 unit of item 3\n   - Keep 2 units of item 4\n   - Keep 2 units of item 5\n\n2) Calculate value:\n   - Total units kept: [1, 3, 1, 2, 2]\n   - Value = (1 \u00d7 61) + (3 \u00d7 75) + (1 \u00d7 5) + (2 \u00d7 81) + (2 \u00d7 45)\n   - Value = 61 + 225 + 5 + 162 + 90 = 543\n   \n543 is below my outside offer, so I need to adjust my strategy to improve my value. Let\u2019s try a different allocation:\n\n1) Keep even more of high-value items:\n   - Keep 2 units of item 1\n   - Keep 4 units of item 2\n   - Keep 0 units of item 3\n   - Keep 2 units of item 4\n   - Keep 4 units of item 5\n\n2) Calculate new value:\n   - Total units kept: [2, 4, 0, 2, 4]\n   - Value = (2 \u00d7 61) + (4 \u00d7 75) + (0 \u00d7 5) + (2 \u00d7 81) + (4 \u00d7 45)\n   - Value = 122 + 300 + 0 + 162 + 180 = 764\n\nStill below 896, need to try another offer focusing even more strongly on my highest value items:\n\n1) Maximize keeping high-value items:\n   - Keep 3 units of item 1\n   - Keep 5 units of item 2\n   - Keep 0 units of item 3\n   - Keep 2 units of item 4\n   - Keep 6 units of item 5\n\n2) Calculate:\n   - Total units: [3, 5, 0, 2, 6]\n   - Value: (3 \u00d7 61) + (5 \u00d7 75) + (0 \u00d7 5) + (2 \u00d7 81) + (6 \u00d7 45)\n   - Value: 183 + 375 + 0 + 162 + 270 = 990\n\nNow the value is above my outside offer of 896. Let's configure the counteroffer now based on what's left for Player 2:\n\n### Counteroffer\n\nTo offer to Player 2:\n   - Offer 1 unit of item 1\n   - Offer 2 units of item 2\n   - Offer 5 units of item 3\n   - Offer 0 units of item 4\n   - Offer 2 units of item 5\n\nResulting in an offer: [1, 2, 5, 0, 2]\n\nSince this adjustment ensures the value I keep exceeds my outside offer and remains optimal for my objectives, the offer will now be presented in this manner:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 5, 0, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 3 + 33 x 0 + 57 x 0 + 60 x 0 + 87 x 3\n    which is 528 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 529. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    78 x 0 + 32 x 1 + 67 x 1 + 10 x 1 + 52 x 1\n    which is 161 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 162. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Since we're in round 1, there's no immediate reduction in value unless we move to later rounds.\n\nNow, let's assess the value of potential offers. The goal is to propose an offer where my share is worth more than my outside offer of 162:\n\n- **Keep 3 each of items 1 and 3, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 4, 2 of item 5 and give the rest to Player 2:**\n  - Item 1: 2 units given away (3 \u00d7 78 = 234 for me)\n  - Item 2: 1 unit given away (2 \u00d7 32 = 64 for me)\n  - Item 3: 1 unit given away (3 \u00d7 67 = 201 for me)\n  - Item 4: 2 units given away (1 \u00d7 10 = 10 for me)\n  - Item 5: 1 unit given away (2 \u00d7 52 = 104 for me)\n  - Total value for me: 613\n\nThis proposed division gives me a significant value of 613, which is much more than my outside offer.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven that the calculated value for keeping 3 each of items 1 and 3, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5 amounts to 613 and is well above the outside offer value of 162, it makes sense to propose this as an initial counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 884. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 567 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 5, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    27 x 4 + 16 x 4 + 77 x 5 + 21 x 4 + 48 x 5\n    which is 881 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 884. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 2, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 2, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, I will analyze the current offer and possible alternatives step-by-step.\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 884.\n   - My values per unit for items are: \n     - Item 1: 27\n     - Item 2: 16\n     - Item 3: 77\n     - Item 4: 21\n     - Item 5: 48\n   - The total pool of items is: [4, 5, 5, 6, 5]\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) influences the negotiation by reducing the value of outcomes as the rounds progress. However, given this is round 1, the full value is considered if accepted now.\n\n2) Assess the value of the current offer:\n   - Current offer (for me): [2, 4, 2, 2, 3]\n   - Total value calculation:\n     - Item 1: 2 units * 27 = 54\n     - Item 2: 4 units * 16 = 64\n     - Item 3: 2 units * 77 = 154\n     - Item 4: 2 units * 21 = 42\n     - Item 5: 3 units * 48 = 144\n   - Total value of current offer = 54 + 64 + 154 + 42 + 144 = 458\n\n3) Decide on the action based on the analysis:\n   - The value of the current offer (458) is far below my outside offer value (884). Accepting the current offer would result in a lower payoff than my outside fallback option.\n   - To improve the value I receive, a new counteroffer must be proposed, ensuring it exceeds the value of 884.\n\nLet's try a potential counteroffer to ensure my value is higher than 884. Suppose I keep [3, 1, 5, 4, 4] for myself, and offer the rest to Player 1:\n\n   - Item 1: 3 units * 27 = 81\n   - Item 2: 1 unit * 16 = 16\n   - Item 3: 5 units * 77 = 385\n   - Item 4: 4 units * 21 = 84\n   - Item 5: 4 units * 48 = 192\n   - Total value = 81 + 16 + 385 + 84 + 192 = 758\n\nWhile improved, this is still below 884. I must maintain more value:\n\nI will keep [3, 2, 5, 5, 4], offering the rest to Player 1:\n\n   - Item 1: 3 units * 27 = 81\n   - Item 2: 2 units * 16 = 32\n   - Item 3: 5 units * 77 = 385\n   - Item 4: 5 units * 21 = 105\n   - Item 5: 4 units * 48 = 192\n   - Total value = 81 + 32 + 385 + 105 + 192 = 795\n\nOnce again, slightly higher but must iterate more.\n\nLet's revise to [3, 1, 5, 6, 4], offering [1, 4, 0, 0, 1] to Player 1 to achieve the highest:\n\n   - Item 1: 3 units * 27 = 81\n   - Item 2: 1 unit * 16 = 16\n   - Item 3: 5 units * 77 = 385\n   - Item 4: 6 units * 21 = 126\n   - Item 5: 4 units * 48 = 192\n   - Total value = 81 + 16 + 385 + 126 + 192 = 800\n\nStill short, continue iterating.\n\nMaintain everything at max efficiency for offer, and let's revise again:\n\nIncrease maximum of highest valued items. Keep revising for optimization... etc.\n\nFinally, concluding, propose:\n\n   {\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n\n(Unless further deeply analyzed final counter version outweighs original setup.)",

The current round is round 1, and any acceptance now would be 100% of the value (gamma = 0.9 for subsequent rounds).\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer to accept.\n   - For a counteroffer, I need to keep items or combinations that provide a total value higher than 1317.\n\nLet's calculate the values for potential counteroffers to ensure they are higher than my outside offer value.\n\n**Initial Ideal Allocation for Maximum Value:**\n- Fully retain high-valued items and strategically choose others:\n  - Keep all units of items with the highest per-unit value:\n    - Item 1: 6 \u00d7 72 = 432\n    - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n  - For Item 3, keep sufficient units to maximize value:\n    - Item 3: 6 \u00d7 61 = 366\n  - Fully consider the distribution of lower-valued items:\n    - Item 4: Only moderately valuable, keep some units if beneficial\n    - Item 2: Moderate priority, finalize distribution after main items\n\nKeep a balanced, high-value calculation:\n- Keep for yourself: [6, 2, 6, 2, 3]\n  - Item 1: 6 \u00d7 72 = 432\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n  - Item 3: 6 \u00d7 61 = 366\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n\n- Total value: 432 + 84 + 366 + 16 + 294 = 1192\n\nThis isn't satisfactory yet because the value is below the outside offer.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 7, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 51 x 2 + 4 x 7 + 56 x 1 + 78 x 1\n    which is 264 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 265. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 387. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 906 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 0 + 16 x 0 + 95 x 2 + 70 x 2 + 54 x 1\n    which is 384 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 387. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 718. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 903 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 0 + 96 x 1 + 79 x 4 + 10 x 1 + 98 x 3\n    which is 716 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 718. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I'll walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 718.\n   - The values of the items for me are: \n     - Item 1: 18\n     - Item 2: 96\n     - Item 3: 79\n     - Item 4: 10\n     - Item 5: 98\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor influences the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers by reducing the value of future rounds by a factor of gamma = 0.9. However, in the first round, the discount doesn't apply yet.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer on the table, so I can't calculate a value for it.\n   - To make a meaningful counteroffer, I need to ensure that the value I derive from items I keep is greater than my outside offer value of 718.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - There's no offer to accept or reject currently, so I have to make an initial offer myself.\n   - I will calculate my potential total value with different proposed divisions:\n\nGiven that I have:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (value 18)\n- 2 units of item 2 (value 96)\n- 4 units of item 3 (value 79)\n- 4 units of item 4 (value 10)\n- 3 units of item 5 (value 98)\n\nTo beat my outside offer (718), I need to keep items such that their combined value is greater than 718.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer:\n- Keep 0 units of item 1\n- Keep 0 units of item 2\n- Keep 4 units of item 3\n- Keep 4 units of item 4\n- Keep 3 units of item 5\n\nCalculating my value for these:\n- Value of 0 units of item 1: 0 * 18 = 0\n- Value of 0 units of item 2: 0 * 96 = 0\n- Value of 4 units of item 3: 4 * 79 = 316\n- Value of 4 units of item 4: 4 * 10 = 40\n- Value of 3 units of item 5: 3 * 98 = 294\n\nTotal value = 0 + 0 + 316 + 40 + 294 = 650\n\nThat's not enough. I need to adjust to improve my counteroffer.\n\nConsider:\n- Keep 1 unit of item 1: 18\n- Keep 0 units of item 2: 0\n- Keep 4 units of item 3: 316\n- Keep 4 units of item 4: 40\n- Keep 3 units of item 5: 294\n\nThis gives a total value of 18 + 0 + 316 + 40 + 294 = 668\n\nStill not sufficient. My outside offer of 718 requires:\n\nLet's keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nCalculating again:\n- Value of 1 unit of item 1: 18\n- Value of 1 unit of item 2: 96\n- Value of 2 units of item 3: 158\n- Value of 2 units of item 4: 20\n- Value of 3 units of item 5: 294\n\nTotal value = 18 + 96 + 158 + 20 + 294 = 586\n\nThis isn't working, making it too difficult to find a combination that's >718.\n\nAdjusting a bit:\n- Keep 1 unit of item 1\n- Keep 2 units of item 2\n- Keep 1 unit of item 3\n- Keep 4 units of item 4\n- Keep 2 units of item 5\n\nCalculating:\n- Value of 1 unit of item 1: 18\n- Value of 2 units of item 2: 192\n- Value of 1 unit of item 3: 79\n- Value of 4 units of item 4: 40\n- Value of 2 units of item 5: 196\n\nTotal value = 18 + 192 + 79 + 40 + 196 = 525\n\nClearly, this is complicated, and I might struggle to find sufficient worth. To prevent mistakes or continuously hitting below the outside offer, let me decide the counteroffer before timeout.\n\nIdeally, propose:\n- 0 units item 1\n- 0 units item 2\n- 4 units item 3\n- 4 units item 4\n- 3 units item 5\n\nTrying for a typical better calculation:\n\nDoing individual values and:\nIdea of [1, 1, 2, 1, 0] (to give)\n- Means keep [0, 1, 2, 3, 3]\n\nI should try:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 718. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 903 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 0 + 96 x 1 + 79 x 4 + 10 x 1 + 98 x 3\n    which is 716 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 718. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Accepting it would be mistake 4.\n   - As this is the final round, I must decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer that ensures I accumulate more than 718.\n   - As it stands, no feasible division of items provides a higher value to me than 718, given the constraints of moving items around. This suggests a WALK might be my optimal course of action to avoid making mistakes 1, 2, or 5.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the optimal action considering the current offer and my outside option is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 2 + 87 x 1 + 45 x 0 + 3 x 5 + 62 x 4\n    which is 402 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 403. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 403. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 669 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 2 + 87 x 1 + 45 x 0 + 3 x 5 + 62 x 4\n    which is 402 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 403. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1189. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1189. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 819 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 6, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 0 + 29 x 3 + 92 x 6 + 97 x 5 + 32 x 2\n    which is 1188 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1189. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 6, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 6, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's adjust:\n\n     - Offer Player 1: [4, 1, 0, 3, 1], I keep:\n       - 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 23 = 92\n       - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n       - 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 92 = 552\n       - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 97 = 291\n       - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 32 = 96\n \n   The recalculated value = 92 + 58 + 552 + 291 + 96 = 1089, still less than 1189.\n\n   Let's offer:\n   - [4, 1, 0, 2, 0], I keep:\n     - 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 23 = 92\n     - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n     - 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 92 = 552\n     - 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 97 = 388\n     - 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 32 = 128\n\n   Total value = 92 + 58 + 552 + 388 + 128 = 1218, exceeding 1189.\n\n   Counteroffer: [4, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\nIn conclusion, I will propose this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 6, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 0 + 29 x 3 + 92 x 6 + 97 x 5 + 32 x 2\n    which is 1188 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1189. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 6, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 1, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [5, 1, 1, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 1, 1, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine my best course of action, let's analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 1189\n   - My values per unit for each item type:\n     - Item 1: 23\n     - Item 2: 29\n     - Item 3: 92\n     - Item 4: 97\n     - Item 5: 32\n   - Total pool of items: 8 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 6 of item 4, 4 of item 5\n   - Current round is 2, so the discount factor of 0.9 applies as \\( \\gamma^{r-1} = 0.9^{1} = 0.9 \\)\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer (Player 1's offer [5, 1, 1, 0, 3]):**\n     - Value of 5 units of item 1: \\(5 \\times 23 = 115\\)\n     - Value of 1 unit of item 2: \\(1 \\times 29 = 29\\)\n     - Value of 1 unit of item 3: \\(1 \\times 92 = 92\\)\n     - Value of 0 units of item 4: \\(0 \\times 97 = 0\\)\n     - Value of 3 units of item 5: \\(3 \\times 32 = 96\\)\n     - Total value = \\(115 + 29 + 92 + 0 + 96 = 332\\)\n     - Discounted value = \\(332 \\times 0.9 = 298.8\\)\n\n   - **Compare with Outside Offer:**\n     - The discounted value of the current offer (298.8) is much lower than my outside offer (1189).\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - I should not accept the current offer because it is far below my outside offer.\n   - Instead, I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value and is worth more than the outside offer.\n\nTo avoid mistake 2 (making an offer worse for me than my outside offer), I will propose a counteroffer that maximizes the total value I retain. Let's calculate an optimal allocation:\n   - To achieve a value higher than 1189, say I keep as much as possible from the highest value items: item 3 and item 4.\n\nPossible Counteroffer:\n   - Offer Player 1: [3, 1, 1, 1, 2] (Giving more of lower-valued items to player 1)\n   - My retained values:\n     - 5 units of item 1: \\(5 \\times 23 = 115\\)\n     - 2 units of item 2: \\(2 \\times 29 = 58\\)\n     - 5 units of item 3: \\(5 \\times 92 = 460\\)\n     - 5 units of item 4: \\(5 \\times 97 = 485\\)\n     - 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 32 = 64\\)\n     - Total = \\(115 + 58 + 460 + 485 + 64 = 1182\\)\n\nGiven my counteroffer doesn't surpass my outside offer when considering the discount, I am unable to find an allocation that beats my outside offer in this round without further rounds. Thus, it seems optimal to walk away, as no reasonable counteroffer beats my guaranteed fallback (outside offer).\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

For this, I have to calculate values for potential scenarios:\n\nLet's start by calculating different division scenarios to evaluate my best offer:\n   \n   - If I keep 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5, this would give me:\n     - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n     - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n     - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 87 = 348\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n     - Item 5: 5 \u00d7 64 = 320\n     - Total value = 841\n   \n   Evaluating this keeps a significant value in high-value items like item 3 and 5, but is still below my fallback value 1133.\n\n   Let's try another configuration, keeping 2 units of items 1 & 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and all 5 units of item 5:\n   - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n   - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n   - Item 3: 5 \u00d7 87 = 435\n   - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n   - Item 5: 5 \u00d7 64 = 320\n   - Total value = 952\n   \n   Still, not optimum yet.\n\n   Now testing keeping 1 unit of items 1, 2; 6 units of item 3; 3 units of item 4; and 5 of item 5:\n   - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n   - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n   - Item 3: 6 \u00d7 87 = 522\n   - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n   - Item 5: 5 \u00d7 64 = 320\n   - Total value = 1014\n   \n   I must further optimize. So let's try keeping all item 3 & 5, while 1 item of 1, 2, 3 of 4:\n   - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n   - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n   - Item 3: 6 \u00d7 87 = 522\n   - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n   - Item 5: 5 \u00d7 64 = 320\n   - Total value = 1014\n   \n   Still no higher values.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - I need to offer such that my own value reaches close to or exceeds 1133.\n   - After evaluating, I will base my counter offer to keep the maximum value still possible:\n\n   If I keep 1 unit of item 1, all of items 2, 3, and 5, and 2 of item 4, based upon:\n     - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n     - Item 2: 6 \u00d7 22 = 132\n     - Item 3: 6 \u00d7 87 = 522\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n     - Item 5: 5 \u00d7 64 = 320\n     - Total value = 1075\n   \n   This is closely approaching to the point that offers are getting optimized but still need further calculation to excel 1133.\n\n   Strategically attempting is crucial, alternate:\n   If I keep 0 items of item 1, 6 units of item 3, 3 of 4, and the full 5 of item 5, what happens:\n     - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n     - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 22 = 0\n     - Item 3: 6 \u00d7 87 = 522\n     - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n     - Item 5: 5 \u00d7 64 = 320\n     - Total value = 989\n\nNow, make the alternative optimized counter for maximizing significant outcomes with thorough balanced item keep:\n- Counter offering such that neither partner deviates exceeding mutual agreement.\n\nImprove offered value by another precise allocation, e.g.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1133. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 6, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 2 + 22 x 4 + 87 x 6 + 49 x 4 + 64 x 5\n    which is 1132 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1133. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 621. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 600 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 3, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    90 x 3 + 27 x 5 + 34 x 3 + 46 x 2 + 3 x 4\n    which is 611 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 621. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 0 + 89 x 3 + 72 x 0 + 66 x 2 + 90 x 5\n    which is 849 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 850. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

Therefore, accepting it would be Mistake 4 (accepting an offer worse for me than my outside offer).\n\n   - Instead of WALKING, assessing a counteroffer is essential to see if I can create a more favorable deal above the 850 value.\n\n   - Let\u2019s try a better distribution where I potentially maximize my share:\n\n     Consider a proposal where I keep:\n     - All 4 units of items 2 and 5, which are the highest value (significant step as it prevents Mistake 2, offering too much):\n       - Items with highest personal value are item 2 (89) and item 5 (90).\n     \n     Additional units (aiming for value greater than 850):\n     - Split items 1, 3, 4 in an advantageous manner.\n\n     - Proposal: Giving [4, 0, 3, 0, 1] to Player 1 and keeping the rest.\n       - Calculation of value:\n         - Item 1: 0 x 72 = 0\n         - Item 2: 4 x 89 = 356\n         - Item 3: 0 x 72 = 0\n         - Item 4: 2 x 66 = 132\n         - Item 5: 4 x 90 = 360\n       - Total value = 356 + 132 + 360 = 848 (This is still below 850, so a refined offer is needed).\n\n   Let's refine further:\n   - Proposal: Giving [3, 1, 2, 0, 1] to Player 1 and keeping the rest.\n     - Calculation of value:\n       - Item 1: 1 x 72 = 72\n       - Item 2: 3 x 89 = 267\n       - Item 3: 1 x 72 = 72\n       - Item 4: 2 x 66 = 132\n       - Item 5: 4 x 90 = 360\n     - Total value = 72 + 267 + 72 + 132 + 360 = 903 (Above 850).\n\nTherefore, the counteroffer that maximizes my expected utility and prevents mistakes is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 0, 1]}\n``` ",

However, since it is round 1, the discount factor does not apply yet.\n\n2) **Assessing Offers:**\n\n   - Currently, there is no existing offer on the table.\n   - I will consider potential counteroffers. My goal is to construct an offer where the value of the items I keep is greater than my outside offer value of 1078.\n\n   Let's calculate some possible divisions:\n\n   - If I keep:\n     - [5, 1, 0, 5, 5] items for myself:\n       - Value = (5 x 87) + (1 x 53) + (0 x 6) + (5 x 26) + (5 x 69)\n       - = 435 + 53 + 0 + 130 + 345\n       - = 963\n\n   This value is less than my outside offer of 1078, so it's not acceptable to me.\n\n   - If I keep:\n     - [6, 2, 0, 5, 5] items for myself:\n       - Value = (6 x 87) + (2 x 53) + (0 x 6) + (5 x 26) + (5 x 69)\n       - = 522 + 106 + 0 + 130 + 345\n       - = 1103\n\n   This value is greater than my outside offer of 1078.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   - Based on the above calculations, a counteroffer where I keep [6, 2, 0, 5, 5] results in a value to me of 1103, which is greater than my outside offer of 1078.\n   - I must now offer Player 2 [1, 7, 5, 0, 0] as a division of the items.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 7, 5, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 0 + 96 x 0 + 41 x 1 + 33 x 5 + 86 x 1\n    which is 292 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 293. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 5, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 0 + 100 x 5 + 37 x 5 + 49 x 2 + 30 x 2\n    which is 843 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 844. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

I want to ensure that the value of the items I keep is greater than my outside offer value of 844.\n\nLet's explore the value of different allocations:\n\n- **Example Counteroffer 1**:\n  - Offer to Player 2: [0, 4, 3, 2, 2]\n  - Items I keep: [2, 5, 2, 1, 1]\n\n  Calculating my value:\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n  - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 100 = 500\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 49 = 49\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n  - Total Value = 845\n\nSince the value (845) is above my outside offer (844), this deal is one I should consider offering.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven this analysis, I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value, avoiding any mistakes (ensuring the value remains above 844 and is beneficial compared to my next best alternative). In this case, Example Counteroffer 1 provides a satisfactory offer.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to make a counteroffer to initiate the negotiation in a way that prioritizes my interests effectively:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 3, 2, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "To determine my action, I need to evaluate the current situation, assess the values of the offer, and make an informed decision following these structured steps:\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n- My outside offer value is 1221.\n- My value per unit of each item is:\n  - Item 1: 56\n  - Item 2: 70\n  - Item 3: 65\n  - Item 4: 30\n  - Item 5: 70\n- The total pool of items is:\n  - Item 1: 2 units\n  - Item 2: 9 units\n  - Item 3: 5 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 3 units\n- The discount factor is 0.9. Since this is round 1, it does not affect the value of an immediate acceptance.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- **Current Offer [0, 4, 3, 2, 2]**:\n  - Value = (0 * 56) + (4 * 70) + (3 * 65) + (2 * 30) + (2 * 70)\n  - Value = 0 + 280 + 195 + 60 + 140\n  - Total Value = 675\n\nThe value of accepting the current offer is 675, which is less than my outside offer value of 1221. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  I should try to devise a counteroffer where the value I retain is greater than 1221. Let's calculate one potential beneficial allocation:\n\n  For example, keeping [1, 7, 5, 3, 3] for myself (offering [1, 2, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1):\n  - Value = (1 * 56) + (7 * 70) + (5 * 65) + (3 * 30) + (3 * 70)\n  - Value = 56 + 490 + 325 + 90 + 210\n  - Total Value I retain = 1171\n  \n  Since 1171 < 1221, this is not a valid offer. Let's try another:\n\n  Let's keep more items, for instance [2, 6, 5, 3, 2] for myself (offering [0, 3, 0, 0, 1] to Player 1):\n  - Value = (2 * 56) + (6 * 70) + (5 * 65) + (3 * 30) + (2 * 70)\n  - Value = 112 + 420 + 325 + 90 + 140\n  - Total Value I retain = 1087\n\nThis is still not sufficient. Let's aim to reduce Player 1's offer further.\n\nLet's try a more aggressive counteroffer, retaining [2, 5, 5, 2, 3] for myself (offering [0, 4, 0, 1, 0] to Player 1):\n- Value of what I keep:\n  - Value = (2 * 56) + (5 * 70) + (5 * 65) + (2 * 30) + (3 * 70)\n  - Value = 112 + 350 + 325 + 60 + 210\n  - Total Value I retain = 1057\n\nThis is just a bit still not feasible. Let's try one last offer adjusting again:\n\nIf I retain [2, 8, 4, 3, 2] for myself (offering [0, 1, 1, 0, 1] to Player 1):\n- Value of what I keep:\n  - Value = (2 * 56) + (8 * 70) + (4 * 65) + (3 * 30) + (2 * 70)\n  - Value = 112 + 560 + 260 + 90 + 140\n  - Total Value I retain = 1162\n\nStill approaching, let's refine:\n\nLet's try [2, 4, 5, 3, 3] for myself (offering [0, 5, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1):\n- Value = 112 + 280 + 325 + 90 + 210\n- Total value I retain = 1017 (less than 1221)\n\nI cannot seem within current constraints to deeply exceed it for this potential. But this indicates current options may need further aggressive negotiation and not yet walking away. However, based on this retracing - no initially viable more exceeding than except walk. Thus,\n\n### 3) Decision:\n- The current offer value (675) is not acceptable as it's less than my outside offer (1221).\n- The counteroffers attempted result in values below 1221, so I cannot currently propose a feasible better offer.\n\nTherefore, to avoid Mistake 5 (rejecting a potentially exceeding in future with walk), I'd counter and enter future rounds for improvement and potential concessions awareness. So my action right now yet a significant:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

I will offer fewer of my high-value items.\n\nLet's propose an initial counteroffer where Player 2 receives:\n- 3 units of Item 1 (I keep 2 \u00d7 17 = 34 value from Item 1)\n- 2 units of Item 2 (I keep 1 \u00d7 45 = 45 value from Item 2)\n- 3 units of Item 3 (I keep 2 \u00d7 15 = 30 value from Item 3)\n- 2 units of Item 4 (I keep 2 \u00d7 30 = 60 value from Item 4)\n- 0 units of Item 5 (I keep 2 \u00d7 82 = 164 value from Item 5)\n\nThis gives me (34 + 45 + 30 + 60 + 164) = 333 value, which far exceeds my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nBased on my calculations, the value of the items I keep in this scenario is far greater than the outside offer value of 73, hence it would be beneficial to propose this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 3, 2, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 643. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 643. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 4, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 0 + 21 x 3 + 70 x 4 + 37 x 3 + 94 x 2\n    which is 642 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 643. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 3, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 3, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the best action, I will evaluate the current offer, my outside offer, and any potential counteroffers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n1. **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 643.\n\n2. **Values of Items** (per unit):\n   - Item 1: 45\n   - Item 2: 21\n   - Item 3: 70\n   - Item 4: 37\n   - Item 5: 94\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items**: \n   - 5 units of item 1\n   - 3 units of item 2\n   - 5 units of item 3\n   - 4 units of item 4\n   - 2 units of item 5\n\n4. **Discount Factor Influence**: The discount factor (\u03b3 = 0.9) influences the future value of offers. In round 1, this factor doesn't yet apply. However, waiting for a better offer needs to be weighed against the risk and potential future decreased value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer Values**:\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n   - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 94 = 0\n   - **Total Value of Current Offer**: 135 + 42 + 210 + 74 + 0 = 461\n\n2. **Comparison with Outside Offer**:\n   - Current offer value (461) is less than the outside offer value (643).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Accept the Current Offer?** No, because 461 is less than 643.\n- **Walk Away?** Not yet, since it is advisable to make a counteroffer to strive for a value greater than 643.\n- **Counteroffer**: I need to propose a value that is higher than my outside offer.\n\nLet's create a counteroffer:\n\nSuppose I keep:\n- Item 1: 1 unit (value = 1 \u00d7 45 = 45)\n- Item 2: 1 unit (value = 1 \u00d7 21 = 21)\n- Item 3: 3 units (value = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210)\n- Item 4: 3 units (value = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111)\n- Item 5: 2 units (value = 2 \u00d7 94 = 188)\n\nThe total for what I keep is 45 + 21 + 210 + 111 + 188 = 575. I still need to provide a counter, amending for a value greater than 643. Let's assume another division:\n\nIf I keep:\n\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 1 unit (value = 1 \u00d7 21 = 21)\n- Item 3: 4 units (value = 4 \u00d7 70 = 280)\n- Item 4: 3 units (value = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111)\n- Item 5: 2 units (value = 2 \u00d7 94 = 188)\n\nThe value to me is: 0 + 21 + 280 + 111 + 188 = 600 which is still below 643. However, offering 0 of item 1, we need at least another unit value change in the formula:\n\nLet's finalize:\n\nIf I keep:\n- Item 1: 4 units (value = 4 \u00d7 45 = 180)\n- Item 2: 0 units\n- Item 3: 4 units (value = 4 \u00d7 70 = 280)\n- Item 4: 0 units\n- Item 5: 2 units (value = 2 \u00d7 94 = 188)\n\nThe value to me becomes: 180 + 0 + 280 + 0 + 188 = 648.\n\nThis exceeds the outside offer value.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 6, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 0 + 90 x 0 + 24 x 6 + 14 x 3 + 98 x 0\n    which is 186 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 188. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 188.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 99 per unit\n     - Item 2: 90 per unit\n     - Item 3: 24 per unit\n     - Item 4: 14 per unit\n     - Item 5: 98 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 6 units of item 1\n     - 6 units of item 2\n     - 8 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 8 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) will influence the value of the negotiation outcome by making future offers less valuable, so reaching an agreement sooner is generally preferable unless I expect to get a much better offer by waiting.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - There is currently no offer on the table from Player 2.\n   - I need to make an initial offer that ensures I receive value greater than my outside offer of 188.\n   - To avoid offering too much, I'll calculate the potential value of keeping significant units of high-value items.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - I should maximize my return by proposing to keep more of the high-value items (items 1, 2, and 5) and giving less of them to Player 2.\n   - I want to ensure my total value is well above my outside offer to account for the negotiation discount.\n   - Let's calculate a counteroffer:\n\n   Suppose I propose the following initial offer to Player 2 (what I offer to Player 2):\n   - [2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5]\n\n   This means I keep:\n   - 4 units of item 1: 4 x 99 = 396\n   - 3 units of item 2: 3 x 90 = 270\n   - 2 units of item 3: 2 x 24 = 48\n   - 0 units of item 4: 0 x 14 = 0\n   - 2 units of item 5: 2 x 98 = 196\n\n   Total value to me = 396 + 270 + 48 + 0 + 196 = 910\n\n   Since 910 is significantly greater than my outside offer of 188, this counteroffer aligns with maximizing my objectives in the negotiation.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to offer the following:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 6, 6, 6]}\n```",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 97 for item 1, 52 for item 2, 83 for item 3, 64 for item 4, 22 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1051. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1038. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1038. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 954 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 2, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 3 + 52 x 4 + 83 x 2 + 64 x 5 + 22 x 2\n    which is 1029 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1038. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on the next action, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 1038.\n   - The values of the items are:\n       - Item 1: 97\n       - Item 2: 52\n       - Item 3: 83\n       - Item 4: 64\n       - Item 5: 22\n   - Total pool of items is:\n       - Item 1: 3 units\n       - Item 2: 4 units\n       - Item 3: 2 units\n       - Item 4: 5 units\n       - Item 5: 3 units\n   - The discount factor gamma = 0.9. This means, if accepted in round 2, the value of the deal needs to be multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer on the table: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n     - My total from this offer:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 64\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 22\n     - Total direct value = 64 + 22 = 86\n     - Discounted value = 86 * 0.9 = 77.4\n\n   - Total discounted value (77.4) is far less than my outside offer value (1038).\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Accepting the current offer would be a mistake because it's significantly less than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away would guarantee my outside offer of 1038.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that would give me more than 1038 in undiscounted value (to risk the reward being lower once discounted by the gamma factor).\n\nTo create a beneficial counteroffer, I need to ensure the sum of items I keep gives a value greater than 1038. Let's calculate and decide:\n- Keep at least 3 units of item 1, which is 3 * 97 = 291\n- For item 2, keep at least 3 units, which is 3 * 52 = 156\n- For item 3, keep all 2 units, which is 2 * 83 = 166\n- For item 4, keep at least 4 units, which is 4 * 64 = 256\n- For item 5, keep at least 2 units, which is 2 * 22 = 44\n\nTotal = 291 + 156 + 166 + 256 + 44 = 913\n\nThis value is significantly lower than my outside offer. Thus, re-adjust to keep all units of items, maintaining my guaranteed fallback of 1038. Propose the following counteroffer considering keeping valuable items:\n\nI'll counteroffer giving Player 2 1 of each of item types 2 and 5. I propose:\n\nCounteroffer = [3, 1, 2, 1, 1] (keeping respectively 0, 3, 0, 4, 2 for myself)\n\nCalculating the value to me:\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 52 = 156\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 * 64 = 256\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 * 22 = 44\n\nTotal = 156 + 256 + 44 = 456\n\nUpon further adjustments, here's the strategy:\n\nSince the exact balance is challenging with this threshold, in round 2 with a high fallback 1038, opting to WALK might be the sound strategy due to possible end round discount constraints and high relative offer value.\n\nFinal Decision:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",
