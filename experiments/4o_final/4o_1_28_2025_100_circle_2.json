Since the offer was in the first round and still attractive, it seems reasonable to consider a counteroffer.\n\nLet's try to make a reasonable counteroffer.\n\n**Possible Counteroffer:**  \n- Give Player 1 fewer units of item 4 to increase my value.  \n- Offer: [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]  \n   - I will receive: [4, 3, 3, 4, 1]\n   \n**Value of Counteroffer to Me:**  \n- Item 1: 4 units, value per unit: 41, total value: 4 \u00d7 41 = 164  \n- Item 2: 3 units, value per unit: 96, total value: 3 \u00d7 96 = 288  \n- Item 3: 3 units, value per unit: 63, total value: 3 \u00d7 63 = 189  \n- Item 4: 4 units, value per unit: 100, total value: 4 \u00d7 100 = 400  \n- Item 5: 1 unit, value per unit: 74, total value: 1 \u00d7 74 = 74  \n\nTotal counteroffer value to me = 164 + 288 + 189 + 400 + 74 = 1115\n\n1115 is higher than the current offer value to me (1081) and also higher than my outside offer value (584).\n\nThus, my decision is to make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

A better positioning could be required, yet this proposed division aims to present a tougher negotiation stance.\n\nAdjust into a higher desirable configuration if there is room:\nInvestigation may occur for different partitions should it be emphasized, further constraining the counterbalance to achieve over 345 precisely in alternatives rather than trial.\n\nGiven the proposed outcome still doesn't surpass my outside offer after evaluating multiple iterations and considerations, my final decision is straightforward:\n\n**I'm going to walk away with my outside offer as it's the most reliable option for maximizing my value.**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 777. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 627 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best action, I'll need to calculate the value of the current offer to me and see if it's more than my outside offer value of 777, adjusted for the round's discount. If not, I should consider a counteroffer or walking away.\n\n### Current Offer from Player 2:\n- **Offer**: [1, 1, 1, 0, 2] (this is what Player 2 is offering to me)\n- **My Share**: \n  - Item 1: \\(1 \\times 70 = 70\\)\n  - Item 2: \\(1 \\times 17 = 17\\)\n  - Item 3: \\(1 \\times 34 = 34\\)\n  - Item 4: \\(3 - 0 = 3 \\times 18 = 54\\) (since they didn't offer any, I have all 3 units)\n  - Item 5: \\(7 - 2 = 5 \\times 70 = 350\\)\n\n- **Total Value to Me**: \\(70 + 17 + 34 + 54 + 350 = 525\\)\n\n### Discount Factor:\n- Since it's round 2, the discount factor is \\(\\gamma^{round-1} = 0.9^{2-1} = 0.9\\).\n- Adjusted Value = \\(525 \\times 0.9 = 472.5\\).\n\n### Comparison to Outside Offer:\n- My outside offer value is 777. \n- \\(472.5\\) (current offer's adjusted value) is significantly less than \\(777\\).\n\n### Decision:\nThe current offer is not acceptable since its adjusted value is much lower than my outside offer. Therefore, I should make a counteroffer that aims to give me a value at or above 777 in order to maximize my utility.\n\n### Potential Counteroffer:\n- To meet or exceed a value of 777 after the discount, I need:\n  - \\((Total\\ Value) \\times 0.9 = 777 \\)\n  - \\(Total\\ Value = \\frac{777}{0.9} = 863.33\\)\n\n#### Counteroffer Calculation:\nI want to keep the items that provide me the most value. I'll try the allocation to reach a total value of 864 or more by maximizing higher value items:\n\n1. Keep all units of item 1 and item 5 as they have the highest value:\n   - Item 1: \\(4 \\times 70 = 280\\)\n   - Item 5: \\(7 \\times 70 = 490\\)\n\n2. Allocate some units of lesser value items:\n   - Allocate all units of item 2, 3, 4 to Player 2 as keeping more of 1 and 5 maximizes the value meeting my required value.\n\nThis yields the counteroffer: [0, 3, 5, 3, 0]\n\nNow let\u2019s check the value to me:\n\n- **My Value from Counteroffer**:\n  - Item 1: \\(4 \\times 70 = 280\\)\n  - Item 5: \\(7 \\times 70 = 490\\)\n\n- **Total Value to Me for This Allocation**: \\(280 + 490 = 770\\)\n\nThis isn't meeting the target total of 863.33 after discount, but it\u2019s close, possibly leaving room to negotiate their offer valuing my competitive items more. Alternatively, prioritize Item 3 to slightly maximize applying full units:\n  - Keeping Item 3: [0, 3, 0, 3, 0].\n\nCalculate:\n- Item 1: 280\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 5 * 34 =170\n- Item 4: 0\n- Item 5: 490\n\nNew total value: \\(280 + 170 + 490 = 940 > 863.33\\)\n\nI\u2019ll offer less, retaining a robust balance maximizing high-item values to ensure meeting the target.\n\n### My Action:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

For instance, I might offer Player 1 fewer units of the higher-value items:\n\n**Counteroffer: [1, 0, 2, 0, 3] (Offer to Player 1)**\n- My kept items: [3, 3, 3, 3, 4]\n\n**Value Calculation:**\n- Total Value of My Kept Items = (3 \u00d7 63) + (3 \u00d7 4) + (3 \u00d7 7) + (3 \u00d7 76) + (4 \u00d7 16)\n- Calculate:\n  - Item 1: 189\n  - Item 2: 12\n  - Item 3: 21\n  - Item 4: 228\n  - Item 5: 64\n- Total = 514\n\nThe value of 514 exceeds my outside offer (356), providing a stronger position for me.\n\nGiven these calculations, the counteroffer ensures that I optimize the value above the outside offer value and positions me better than the current offer from Player 1.

For instance:\n     - Offer: [2, 1, 0, 3, 1]\n     - This means I offer 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2.\n   \n   **My Calculation:**\n   \n   Retained values are:\n   - Item 1: (3 units \u00d7 37) = 111\n   - Item 2: (3 units \u00d7 82) = 246\n   - Item 3: (2 units \u00d7 62) = 124\n   - Item 4: (5 units \u00d7 51) = 255\n   - Item 5: (3 units \u00d7 62) = 186\n\n   Total retained value = 111 + 246 + 124 + 255 + 186 = 922\n\nThe value I'm keeping (922) is significantly higher than my outside offer, making this a reasonable starting point.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 3, 1]}\n```",

Adjusting because our counter part is the same value as outside offer makes my offer too low value offered to me. I'll suggest a slightly better one for me to surpass the cutoff.\n\n### Refined Counteroffer:\n1. Offering Player 2: 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 1 of item 5\n2.

Offering Player 2: 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 1 of item 5\n2.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, it wouldn't be beneficial for me to accept this offer.\n\n2. **Counteroffer Calculation**\n\n   If I were to make a counteroffer, I should aim for a value greater than 481.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Despite attempts to compose a favorable counteroffer, the constraint on Player 1's possible acceptance and maximizing my value post-discount complicates surpassing my outside offer potential.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 593. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 864 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Consider the total items: [2, 3, 3, 4, 5].\n\n   My initial offer was [1, 1, 1, 2, 2], giving me remaining [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]:\n   - Value = 1\u00d734 + 2\u00d767 + 2\u00d747 + 2\u00d748 + 3\u00d749 = 238\n   \n   Player 2's offer (current offer on the table):\n   - My Value = 196\n\n   To justify a counteroffer, any proposal must still give me value exceeding 117 effectively.

A balanced approach could be offering a single unit of some items to Player 2 to retain as much of my value as possible while still being fair to Player 2.\n\n- Offer 1 unit of item 2, keeping 2 for myself:\n  - Value I retain: 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n\n- Offer 0 units of item 3, keeping all for myself (as offering any significantly reduces my value):\n  - Value I retain: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n\n- Offer 1 unit of item 4, keeping 1 for myself:\n  - Value I retain: 1 \u00d7 67 = 67\n\n- Offer 1 unit of item 5, keeping 1 for myself:\n  - Value I retain: 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n\nAdding up my retained values, I get: 178 + 84 + 67 + 45 = 374\n\nThis total, 374, is significantly below my outside offer of 495.

I could instead try offering 0 of everything to see if there's a better deal proposed by Player 2, knowing I have only a little negotiation space without offering too much.\n\nTherefore, I decide to go for a different strategy where I take the risk to see a counteroffer from Player 2 by offering nothing at first.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on the action, I need to evaluate the value of the current offer to me and compare it with my outside offer value.\n\n1. **Evaluate the Current Offer**:  \n   The current offer is [0, 3, 1, 2, 2], which means I am getting:\n   - 0 units of item 1 (Value: 0 \u00d7 80 = 0)\n   - 3 units of item 2 (Value: 3 \u00d7 89 = 267)\n   - 1 unit of item 3 (Value: 1 \u00d7 42 = 42)\n   - 2 units of item 4 (Value: 2 \u00d7 67 = 134)\n   - 2 units of item 5 (Value: 2 \u00d7 45 = 90)\n\n   Total value of the offer = 267 + 42 + 134 + 90 = 533\n\n2. **Considering the Discount Factor**:\n   Since we're in round 2, the overall value of the negotiation is the current offer value multiplied by the discount rate \u03b3^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n   Adjusted value of the current offer = 533 \u00d7 0.9 = 479.7\n\n3. **Compare with Outside Offer**:\n   My outside offer is 495.\n\n   The adjusted value of the current offer (479.7) is less than my outside offer (495).\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   Since the adjusted value of the current offer is less than my outside offer, I should not accept it. Instead, I should make a counteroffer that aims to maximize my value more than 495.\n\n5. **Determine the Counteroffer**:\n   - I need to keep a combination of items that gives me a value greater than 495 after applying the discount factor.\n\n   If I were to make a counteroffer, I should consider the distribution like:\n   - Try to keep all of item 2 for myself since it provides the highest value.\n   - Offer minimal quantities of other lower-value items to Player 2 that still keep me above the value 495 after discounting.\n   \n   Let\u2019s propose an offer where I balance items to keep my value above 550 (to ensure it meets the threshold after discount):\n   Giving Player 2:\n   - 0 units of item 2 (ensuring I retain maximum value)\n   - 1 units of item 3\n   - 1 units of item 4\n   - 1 unit of item 5\n   \n   My kept count: [0, 3, 1, 1, 1]\n\n   Calculate my value: \n   \n   Value = (0 \u00d7 80) + (3 \u00d7 89) + (1 \u00d7 42) + (1 \u00d7 67) + (1 \u00d7 45) = 454\n   \n   Adjust with discount factor for potential future rounds = 454 \u00d7 0.9 = 408.6\n   \n   Clearly, I can't propose a counter offer that would satisfy both the discount rate and my current outside offer. Therefore, knowing that the value I retain from any possible offer based on the items proposed doesn't meet or exceed 495, it is more rational to walk away and secure my outside offer. \n\nTherefore, given that the proposed scenarios cannot supersede the value of walking away when factoring in the discount rate, the most rational action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Since it's round 1, and I need to maximize my value above my outside offer of 1178, let's propose giving away items in a way that gives me a total value slightly above my outside offer after discounting:\n\n   - If I offer Player 2:\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 x 47 = 47\n     - 2 units of item 2: 2 x 63 = 126\n     - 2 units of item 3: 2 x 72 = 144\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 x 15 = 15\n     - 0 units of item 5: 0 x 86 = 0\n\n   - I will keep:\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 x 47 = 94\n     - 4 units of item 2: 4 x 63 = 252\n     - 7 units of item 3: 7 x 72 = 504\n     - 4 units of item 4: 4 x 15 = 60\n     - 3 units of item 5: 3 x 86 = 258\n   - Total value I receive: 94 + 252 + 504 + 60 + 258 = 1168\n\n   - The discounted value of this offer by my value is: 1168\n\nIn this case, my counteroffer would aim to keep a value that is slightly below my outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 219. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, if there is room for improvement, I might make a counteroffer to maximize my gain.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate a Potential Counteroffer**\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that keeps more items for myself, especially those with higher personal value:\n\n- I want to maximize the units of item 4, as it has the highest value to me. I will keep all units of item 4.\n- I will allow Player 1 to have more units of item 1, since it is less valuable to me.\n- Many of item 5\u2019s units are in their offer. I might give up item 5 if item 4 is more beneficial.\n\n**Create a Counteroffer that Maximizes My Value:**\n\nAssume I offer Player 1:\n- 2 units of item 1 (keeping 1 unit for myself)\n- 5 units of item 2 (keeping 2 units)\n- 3 units of item 3 (keeping 3 units)\n- 0 units of item 4 (keeping all 3 units)\n- 5 units of item 5 (keeping 2 units)\n\nCalculate what I keep:\n- Item 1: 1 unit x 46 = 46\n- Item 2: 2 units x 63 = 126\n- Item 3: 3 units x 36 = 108\n- Item 4: 3 units x 95 = 285\n- Item 5: 2 units x 14 = 28\n\nNew total value for me = 46 + 126 + 108 + 285 + 28 = 593\n\nThis is significantly above both the current value of 402 and my outside offer of 214.\n\n**Decision: Make a Counteroffer**\n\nThe counteroffer is worth 593 to me, which is substantially higher than the current offer and my outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 6, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 6, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's calculate the value:\n\n- Item 1: 2 units x 77 (value per unit) = 154\n- Item 2: 0 units x 95 (value per unit) = 0\n- Item 3: 0 units x 49 (value per unit) = 0\n- Item 4: 2 units x 8 (value per unit) = 16\n- Item 5: 2 units x 14 (value per unit) = 28\n\nTotal value of the current offer = 154 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 28 = 198\n\nSince it is round 2, the discount rate (gamma) should be applied. However, since the value with gamma (0.9) is still below my outside offer value, I will compare with the unadjusted value because the core fact doesn\u2019t change (discount adjusted further drops the below-threshold value).\n\n### Outside Offer\nMy outside offer is valued at 824.\n\n### Comparison\nThe unadjusted value of the current offer (198) is far less than my outside offer (824), meaning accepting this offer would be worse than taking my outside option.\n\n### Potential Counteroffer\nI need a counteroffer that gives me a value of at least 824. Calculate what I can keep for myself while making an offer to Player 2:\n\nAssume I retain most of the higher value items:\n\n- Keep 4 units of item 1 (4 x 77 = 308)\n- Keep 4 units of item 2 (4 x 95 = 380)\n- Offer 2 units of item 3 (0 x 49 = 0)\n- Offer 4 units of item 4 (0 x 8 = 0)\n- Offer 5 units of item 5 (0 x 14 = 0)\n\nRemaining total value to me with these items:\n  - Value = 308 (item 1) + 380 (item 2) = 688\n\n688 is still less than 824. I can make adjustments:\n\n- Offer 1 unit of item 2 instead:\n  - Keep 5 units of item 2 (5 x 95 = 475)\n\n  Now, the value becomes:\n  - Value = 308 (item 1) + 475 (item 2) = 783\n\n783 is still less than 824.\n\nLet's finalize my decision:\n- Since even with adjustments, no reasonable offer provides a value better than my outside option, the most secure approach is to walk away. This ensures I receive at least 824, which is better than any achievable division with Player 2 unless they offer more configurations.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe current value offered (198) and potential configurations are worse than my guaranteed outside offer of 824. Therefore, it is prudent to walk away to secure this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Sum the total value from this offer: 82 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 92 = 177\n\nNow compare this value to my outside offer, which is 361. Since 177 is significantly less than 361, accepting this offer would give me less value than my guaranteed outside offer. \n\nGiven that the current offer does not meet my minimum requirement to surpass my outside offer value, I do not want to accept it. Walking away is an option, but since it is only the first round, I will make a counteroffer to try to maximize my outcome.\n\nTo construct a beneficial counteroffer, I need it to have a value greater than 361 (my outside offer). Considering the total units available and the fact that this is a negotiation, I will attempt a fair, yet ambitious, counteroffer:\n\nLet's propose:\n- I take 3 units of item 1 (high value to me)\n- I keep 3 units of item 5 (valuable to me)\n\nOffer the rest to Player 1:\n- Give 3 units of item 2 (less valuable to me)\n- Give 1 unit of item 3 (minimally valued)\n- Give 3 units of item 4 (low value to me)\n\nThe counteroffer then: [0, 3, 1, 3, 1]\n\nThis gives me the following allocation and calculation:\n- 3 units of item 1 (82 value per unit): 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 46 = 138\n\nTotal value = 246 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 138 = 384\n\n384 is above my outside offer of 361. Thus, this counteroffer is favorable.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 3, 1]}\n```",

Given the values, let's revise to offer a lower share of high value items to Player 2, while still aiming for a fair trade.\n\nLet's propose a final counteroffer aiming to keep the valuable items:\n\n- Units to Player 2: [1, 0, 1, 2, 3]\n   \nThis would leave me with:\n- Units for Me: [2, 0, 2, 3, 4]\n\nRecalculate my value under this distribution:\n\n1. **Item 1**: 2 \u00d7 54 = 108\n2. **Item 2**: 0 \u00d7 61 = 0\n3. **Item 3**: 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n4. **Item 4**: 3 \u00d7 30 = 90\n5. **Item 5**: 4 \u00d7 28 = 112\n\n- Total value = 108 + 0 + 72 + 90 + 112 = 382\n\nThis still does not meet my outside offer, so I would adjust slightly to retain more on my side:\n\n- Adjust and finalize counter offer: [1, 0, 2, 3, 3]\n  \nThis means I get: \n- [2, 0, 1, 2, 4]\n\nVerify final value:\n\n1. **Item 1**: 2 \u00d7 54 = 108\n2. **Item 2**: 0 \u00d7 61 = 0\n3. **Item 3**: 1 \u00d7 36 = 36\n4. **Item 4**: 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n5. **Item 5**: 4 \u00d7 28 = 112\n\n- Total value: 108 + 0 + 36 + 60 + 112 = 316\n\nNow it still needs adjustment, so I'll aim to satisfy more for my outside offer with less concession:\n\nThe counteroffer should give nights below one now for adjustment!:\n\n- Counteroffer: [2, 0, 3, 4, 5]\n\nAdjust to balance more: [2, 0, 1, 2, 4]\n   \nThe final offer favored high value balance.",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 527. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 471 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

A simple strategy is to keep more units of higher-valued items to increase my value.\n\nProposing a counteroffer where I get:\n- 2 units of item 1 (so offer 4 to Player 1)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (so offer 2 to Player 1)\n- 0 units of item 3 (so offer 2 to Player 1)\n- 2 units of item 4 (so offer 1 to Player 1)\n- 0 units of item 5 (so offer 2 to Player 1)\n\nCalculating my value for this counteroffer:\n- 4 units of item 1 left for me = 4 \u00d7 29 = 116\n- 1 unit of item 2 left for me = 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n- 0 units of item 3 left for me = 0\n- 1 unit of item 4 left for me = 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n- 0 units of item 5 left for me = 1 \u00d7 71 = 71\n\nTotal value: 116 + 64 + 0 + 10 + 71 = 261\n\nThe total value of 261 is still below 690, but given that I am securing more of the high-value items, and this is just the start of the negotiation, it might pressure Player 1 to improve their offer significantly.\n\nSince my counteroffer is also below my outside offer, but closer to ideal values I prefer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 2, 1, 2]}",

Given the discount factor and the uncertainty about Player 2's values, this is a narrow margin.\n\n3. **Strategic Offering:**\n   - I want a deal that is more favorable than just my outside offer after applying the discount factor.\n   - The goal is to make an offer that maximizes my gain beyond 1354 after negotiations.\n   - A key aspect here is to keep enough high-value items (based on my values) while offering the other player something reasonable.\n\n4. **Formulate Initial Offer:**\n   - I aim to retain as much high-value items as possible while still making a reasonable offer that might be acceptable by Player 2.\n   - I will propose giving Player 2 lesser units or lower-value items to me, keeping more high-value items for myself.\n\n   Calculation based on offering:\n   Let's consider offering Player 2:\n   - Item 1: 2 units\n   - Item 2: 3 units\n   - Item 3: 3 units\n   - Item 4: 2 units\n   - Item 5: 0 units\n\n   Items I keep:\n   - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 42 = 126\n   - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 94 = 376\n   - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 24 = 72\n   - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 71 = 213\n   - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 75 = 75\n\n   Total value to me = 126 + 376 + 72 + 213 + 75 = 862\n\n   However, when multiplied by the discount factor (gamma = 0.9) in current or subsequent rounds, I need to ensure the value is acceptable.\n\n5. **Adjust Offer to Ensure Maximum Value:**\n\n   Since we are still in the first round, let's attempt a slightly stronger position:\n   Offer Player 2:\n   - Item 1: 1 unit\n   - Item 2: 2 units\n   - Item 3: 3 units\n   - Item 4: 1 unit\n   - Item 5: 0 units\n\nCalculate the remain for me:\n   - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 42 = 168\n   - Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 94 = 470\n   - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 24 = 72\n   - Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 71 = 284\n   - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 75 = 75\n\nTotal value = 168 + 470 + 72 + 284 + 75 = 1069\n\nThis is below the outside offer but in the first round before discount factor, hopefully, the negotiation will favor it.

The current offer is not favorable.\n\n5. **Counteroffer Calculation:**\n   - I should try to keep items with the highest value per unit for myself. Items 2 and 4 have the highest values to me.\n   - Possible counteroffer: Give away less of items 2 and 4, which importantly affect my value due to their high worth.\n   - Let\u2019s propose keeping maximum of items 2 and 4: Offer [1, 2, 1, 1, 0] instead.\n   - Value received: \n     - Item 1: \\(4 \\times 42 = 168\\)\n     - Item 2: \\(5 \\times 94 = 470\\)\n     - Item 3: \\(5 \\times 24 = 120\\)\n     - Item 4: \\(4 \\times 71 = 284\\)\n     - Item 5: \\(1 \\times 75 = 75\\)\n   - Total value = \\(168 + 470 + 120 + 284 + 75 = 1117\\).\n\nAfter applying gamma: \\(1117 \\times 0.9 = 1005.3\\).\n\nThis is still lower than my outside offer, but preferable to the current offer and might induce Player 2 to reconsider the division of items. However, currently any counteroffer still seems less appealing than my outside option strictly speaking in terms of total immediate value. Despite that, a slight re-strategization might prompt a better final round negotiation and create a more balanced ground:\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "To decide on my action, let's evaluate the current offer and consider creating a counteroffer if necessary. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Current Offer**: The current offer from Player 2 is [0, 2, 1, 2, 3]. It represents the units of each item being allocated to me.\n   - Item 1: 0 units, my value = 0\n   - Item 2: 2 units, my value = 2 \u00d7 16 = 32\n   - Item 3: 1 unit, my value = 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n   - Item 4: 2 units, my value = 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\n   - Item 5: 3 units, my value = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180\n   - Total value = 0 + 32 + 65 + 92 + 180 = 369\n\n2. **Consider the Discount**: Since we are now in round 2, we apply the discount factor:\n   - Discount factor (gamma) for round 2 = \\( \\gamma^{1} = 0.9^1 = 0.9 \\)\n   - Adjusted value of the offer: 0.9 \u00d7 369 = 332.1\n\n3. **Compare to Outside Offer**: My outside offer is 966. The current value of the proposal (332.1) is significantly lower than my outside offer. Therefore, accepting the current offer is not in my best interest.\n\n4. **Counteroffer Evaluation**:\n   I will attempt to create a counteroffer that aims to get me a total value closer to or higher than my outside offer of 966. Ideally, it should provide me a value that surpasses my discounted value of the current round.\n\n5. **Forming My Counteroffer**:\n   A possible strategy is to offer Player 2 a split that gives me more of the high-value items to me. For example, keeping more of item 3 and item 5.\n\n   Let's propose:\n   - Offer [0, 1, 0, 1, 2] to Player 2 (Player 1 keeps [2, 4, 4, 4, 4])\n\n   **Calculation of Potential Keeping**:\n   - Item 1: 2 units, value = 2 \u00d7 38 = 76\n   - Item 2: 4 units, value = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64\n   - Item 3: 4 units, value = 4 \u00d7 65 = 260\n   - Item 4: 4 units, value = 4 \u00d7 46 = 184\n   - Item 5: 4 units, value = 4 \u00d7 60 = 240\n   - Total value of keeping = 76 + 64 + 260 + 184 + 240 = 824\n\n   Given that the resulting value (824) is not as favorable as taking my outside offer, it still provides a substantial value but I'm able to stay in the negotiations for a potentially better conclusion because of future discounting concerns for Player 2 as well.\n\n   The risk remains because my plan is still under my ideal outcome after the discount. However, it might be enough to pressure Player 2 to accept or counter with a more favorable offer for both parties in the next round.\n\n6. **Decision**:\n   Take a strategic risk with another optimal split for value recognition to avoid walking at this stage.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By keeping more units of a high-value item:\n\nUltimately, retaining the current values doesn't satisfy my need to exceed the outside offer of 491, thus I'll generate a more competitive offer that exceeds my baseline, thereby optimizing strategy based on adjustments for retaining key values:\n\n- Give 2 of Item 4 to Player 2: Keep 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 \n\nRe-evaluation of retained value:\n- Item 1: 3 \u00d7 55 = 165\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n- Item 3: 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n- Item 4: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n- Item 5: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n\nTotal retained value = 165 + 56 + 261 + 10 + 0 = 492\n\nThis approach achieves a value greater than my outside offer and is beneficial for negotiation purposes:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 2, 3]}",

Consider keeping:\n   - 2 units of Item 1 (value to me = 2 \u00d7 38 = 76)\n   - 3 units of Item 2 (value to me = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36)\n   - 2 units of Item 3 (value to me = 2 \u00d7 42 = 84)\n   - 1 units of Item 4 (value to me = 1 \u00d7 22 = 22)\n   - 2 units of Item 5 (value to me = 2 \u00d7 36 = 72)\n\n2. Total value = 76 + 36 + 84 + 22 + 72 = 290.\n\n3. Offer to Player 2:\n   - 1 unit of Item 1\n   - 0 units of Item 2\n   - 1 unit of Item 3\n   - 1 unit of Item 4\n   - 1 unit of Item 5\n\nCalculating the value of the items I'm suggesting to offer:\n\n- Item 1: 1 unit, value to me = 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n- Item 2: 0 unit, value to me = 0 \u00d7 12 = 0\n- Item 3: 1 unit, value to me = 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n- Item 4: 1 unit, value to me = 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n- Item 5: 1 unit, value to me = 1 \u00d7 36 = 36\n\n### Are these conditions better than my outside offer?\n- Kept value (290) > Outside offer value (45)\n\nThis division heavily favors keeping items with higher personal value. Offering one unit each of a high value to Player 2. This ensures I keep a significant value for myself and exceeds my outside offer.\n\n### Offering Strategy\nSince my kept value (290) is significantly better than my outside offer (45), I will make this offer to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

I need to make a counteroffer that increases my value to at least match or exceed the outside offer.\n\n**Counteroffer Strategy:**\n\nTo achieve a value at least equal to my outside offer, I need to adjust the current offer such that my retained items have a total higher value.\n\nLet's propose the following counteroffer:\n\n- I propose to give away fewer items with high values to me, like item 3 and item 1, as follows:\n\nProposed counteroffer to Player 1: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nThis means I keep:\n\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 x 69 = 207\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 x 14 = 14\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 x 93 = 279\n- 5 units of item 4: 5 x 40 = 200\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 x 22 = 22\n\n**Total value of my retained items:** 207 + 14 + 279 + 200 + 22 = 722\n\nThis retained value exceeds my outside offer value of 513.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Offer Player 2 lesser valued or neutral items, while I keep more of the higher valued items to ensure my total retained value exceeds 504.\n\n2.

Let's iterate a strategic initial offer edging closer to 504 internal benefit toward another understanding:\n\n### Revised Offer:\n\nTo maximize my benefit within required higher realization:\n\n   - **Item 1:** 1 units\n   - **Item 2:** 1 units\n   - **Item 3:** 4 units (surrender fully if all 3 isn't sufficient)\n   - **Item 4:** 2 units\n   - **Item 5:** 2 units\n   \nLet's recalculate the reservation value based for usefulness:\n\n   - Kept generally lesser throughout, work more collaboratively for future scoped profit conversions intact after second negotiation variability.\n    \nThus maximizing possible suggestions between participant to one side retaining competitiveness up marginal sense flexibility strategically being more thrived across own respected understanding transactional adaptation indicates original stance collectively reflecting optimized advance.\n\n**Choose Counteroffer**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 4, 2, 2]}\n```",

I should make a counteroffer that gives me a better value than my outside offer when accounting for potential acceptance in the next round.\n\n### Proposed Counteroffer:\nTo maximize my return, I should offer fewer high-value items back. I will aim to keep more of the items I value highly, such as items 1 and 3.\n\n#### Goal:\nGet value greater than 1011, considering this is round 1 and a potential acceptance in round 2 should effectively discount the counteroffer value by gamma = 0.9 (because of rounding rules so far).\n\n### Counteroffer Proposal:\n- Offer the other player more items while maintaining more of item 1 and item 3 for myself.\n\nOffer Proposal:\n- **Item 1**: Keep all 3 units = \\(3 \\times 92 = 276\\)\n- **Item 2**: 1 unit to Player 1, keep 2 units = \\(2 \\times 57 = 114\\)\n- **Item 3**: 2 units to Player 1, 2 units to me = \\(2 \\times 100 = 200\\)\n- **Item 4**: 2 units to Player 1, 2 to me = \\(2 \\times 81 = 162\\)\n- **Item 5**: Offer 3 units, keep 3 units = \\(3 \\times 73 = 219\\)\n\n**Total Value of Proposed Counteroffer to Me**: \\(276 + 114 + 200 + 162 + 219 = 971\\)\n\nWhen applying the gamma discount (if accepted in the next round): 971 x 0.9 = 873.9 which is still less than 1011. Thus, I will offer slightly less:\n\nRevised offer:\n\n- **Item 2:** I'll adjust the offer of item 2 to keep 1 more unit. \n\nHere's the final counteroffer with the new value calculations:\n- **Item 1**: 0 units to Player 1\n- **Item 2**: 2 units to Player 1\n- **Item 3**: 1 unit to Player 1\n- **Item 4**: 2 units to Player 1\n- **Item 5**: 3 units to Player 1\n\nThis results in:\n- **Value of units to keep**:\n  - **Item 1**: 3 units = \\(3 \\times 92 = 276\\)\n  - **Item 2**: 1 unit = \\(1 \\times 57 = 57\\)\n  - **Item 3**: 3 units = \\(3 \\times 100 = 300\\)\n  - **Item 4**: 2 units = \\(2 \\times 81 = 162\\)\n  - **Item 5**: 3 units = \\(3 \\times 73 = 219\\)\n\nTotal Value: \\(276 + 57 + 300 + 162 + 219 = 1014\\)\n\nConsidering the gamma discount in round 2, \\(1014 \\times 0.9 = 912.6\\) but if Player 1 values more certain items too, this should increase my chance of achieving a balance to accept.\n\nGiven this counteroffer is slightly above my threshold without discount consideration, I will propose:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 2, 3]}\n```",

I realize I need to prioritize retaining as much of high value:\n\nAdjusting:\nOffer 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n\nRecompute retained value:\n- Item 1: 1 unit (1 * 10 = 10)\n- Item 2: 2 units (2 * 23 = 46)\n- Item 3: 5 units (5 * 36 = 180)\n- Item 4: 0 unit (0 * 12 = 0)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (1 * 8 = 8)\n\nTotal value = 10 + 46 + 180 + 0 + 8 = 244\n\nI now recognize that staying back with 9 units isn't going to get enough value above 291 without a high retention of item 3, items 2 and 4 and discarding overhead:\n\nTherefore, I will aim to go for a balance such that it advances next rounds:\n\nI offer: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 unit of item 5.\n\nRe-evaluate retained value:\n- Item 1: 3 units (3 * 10 = 30)\n- Item 2: 2 units (2 * 23 = 46)\n- Item 3: 3 units (3 * 36 = 108)\n- Item 4: 2 unit (2 * 12 = 24)\n- Item 5: 2 unit (2 * 8 = 16)\n\nTotal value = 30 + 46 + 108 + 24 + 16 = 224 \n\nNone of these configurations return satisfactory values because a balanced true maximization didn\u2019t land. A precise approach with more conditions may resolve optimally, hence for practical offering consternation to start and instill introduce the agreeable start path:\n\nFinally, upper-bound determination implies optimized balance through fair initial offer, to yield calculated offer as:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]}",

Let's calculate the value of this offer:\n\n- Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 86 = 172\n- Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 50 = 150\n- Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 40 = 120\n- Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 43 = 43\n- Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 17 = 17\n\n**Total Value to Me from Current Offer:**  \n172 (Item 1) + 150 (Item 2) + 120 (Item 3) + 43 (Item 4) + 17 (Item 5) = 502\n\n**2. Compare with Outside Offer:**\n\nMy guaranteed outside offer is 979.\n\n- The current offer value (502) is significantly less than my outside offer (979).\n\n**3. Consider a Counteroffer:**\n\nI need to propose a counteroffer that might persuade Player 1 to accept, but also provides me with a value greater than 979. I will propose keeping more high-value items to myself.\n\nLet's try offering fewer items to Player 1, while ensuring my value is above 979:\n\nCounterproposal: [1, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n\n- Item 1 (keeping 3): 3 units \u00d7 86 = 258\n- Item 2 (keeping 4): 4 units \u00d7 50 = 200\n- Item 3 (keeping 3): 3 units \u00d7 40 = 120\n- Item 4 (keeping 2): 2 units \u00d7 43 = 86\n- Item 5 (keeping 1): 1 unit \u00d7 17 = 17\n\n**Total Value to Me from Counteroffer:**  \n258 (Item 1) + 200 (Item 2) + 120 (Item 3) + 86 (Item 4) + 17 (Item 5) = 681\n\nEven with this new allocation, the value I calculated is still less than my outside offer (979), suggesting a need for a more aggressive counteroffer, like aiming to keep more high-value Item 1 or Item 2 due to their high individual values to me.\n\nAnother attempt might be more conservative in giving away lesser-value items while controlling more higher-value ones. \n\nLet me attempt another counteroffer which maximizes my value:\n\nCounterproposal: [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n\n- Item 1 (keeping 3): 3 units \u00d7 86 = 258\n- Item 2 (keeping 4): 4 units \u00d7 50 = 200\n- Item 3 (keeping 4): 4 units \u00d7 40 = 160\n- Item 4 (keeping 2): 2 units \u00d7 43 = 86\n- Item 5 (keeping 1): 1 unit \u00d7 17 = 17\n\n**Total Value to Me from New Counteroffer:**  \n258 (Item 1) + 200 (Item 2) + 160 (Item 3) + 86 (Item 4) + 17 (Item 5) = 721\n\nAlso, still lesser than 979, but closer than before. Given the constraints and hoping Player 1 values other items differently, offering them more evenly might tilt a bit for them to consider.\n\n- Finally, given that returning to the original stance still aims below 979 and Player 1 providing enough of every item, the attempt could still be weak at counter unless a strategic guess of them valuing items differently occurs. Considering offers to Player 1 that balances or alters slightly or highlights their value sought better should proceed.\n\nHowever, to minimize cool loss, attempt an adjust slight for particular areas:\n\nFinal Swiss Attempt: [1, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nFor instance, aiming a revised total down till value cracks calculation better representation.\n\nBut in tendency still finds the strategy:  \n\n\nWalking on, seems bleak till optimal, ensures grounded safety. \n\nSo rendering conclusion translating appropriately: find action deliberated worth without struck worst from back-bracket constraints laminating safety back to numerator deliberation.

However, the offer can be adjusted to increase my present value or test Player 2's response flexibility. \n\nSince I must maximize more than 658, I need a better strategy:\n\n3. **Improvement Strategy:**\n   Adjusting individual item offerings as follows, focusing on the remaining units left for me:\n\n   - **Give 1 units of item 1.** Keep 1 unit, yielding 68.\n   - **Give 3 units of item 2.** Keep 3 units, yielding 243.\n   - **Give 0 units of item 3.** Keep 3 units, yielding 138.\n   - **Give 0 units of item 4.** Keep 3 units, yielding 123.\n   - **Give 1 units of item 5.** Keep 1 unit, yielding 10.\n\nTotal value of keeping: 68 + 243 + 138 + 123 + 10 = 582\n\nThis still remains below my outside offer, only better action would be to hold off negotiating heavily and see if player 2 presents adjustments.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 850. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 747 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus, the raw value has to be above \\(850 / 0.9 = 944.44\\) in case of acceptance in the final round.\n\n   Consider giving more of item 4 (which has the lowest value to me) and ensuring high-value items stay with me in significant quantities:\n\n   - Let's try: [0, 0, 2, 3, 0]\n     - I get: (2 of item 1) \u2192 \\(2 \\times 72 = 144\\)\n     - I get: (2 of item 2) \u2192 \\(2 \\times 40 = 80\\)\n     - I get: (4 of item 3) \u2192 \\(4 \\times 85 = 340\\)\n     - I get: (2 of item 4) \u2192 \\(2 \\times 14 = 28\\)\n     - I get: (3 of item 5) \u2192 \\(3 \\times 38 = 114\\)\n\n     Total value = \\(144 + 80 + 340 + 28 + 114 = 706\\)\n\n     If accepted with gamma in round 3: \\(706 \\times 0.9 = 635.4\\)\n\n   This value is still lower than 850, although it would be accepted in round 2.\n\nSince making a counteroffer that improves on the current state seems difficult without making it unappealing for Player 2, and given the current offer isn't beneficial compared to my outside offer, my best choice is to WALK, ensuring I receive the 850 from my outside offer. \n\nMy action is:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 41 for item 1, 36 for item 2, 41 for item 3, 73 for item 4, 64 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1211. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 73. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 73. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 765 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To decide on the action, I need to evaluate the value of the current offer to me and compare it with my outside offer value of 73.\n\nLet's evaluate the current offer from Player 1 to see its value to me:\n\n- I am offered 2 units of item 1, valued at 41 each: 2 \u00d7 41 = 82\n- I am offered 0 units of item 2, valued at 36 each: 0 \u00d7 36 = 0\n- I am offered 1 unit of item 3, valued at 41 each: 1 \u00d7 41 = 41\n- I am offered 0 units of item 4, valued at 73 each: 0 \u00d7 73 = 0\n- I am offered 2 units of item 5, valued at 64 each: 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n\nTotal value of the current offer to me = 82 + 0 + 41 + 0 + 128 = 251\n\nThe value of the current offer (251) is much higher than my outside offer value (73). Accepting this offer gives me a better outcome than walking away.\n\nGiven that the value of the current offer is much more favorable than ignoring it and sticking with my outside offer, I will accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",
