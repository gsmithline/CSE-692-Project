Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 33. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 33. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 381 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

In this round, it doesn't apply since it's round 1, but in future rounds, my value will be multiplied by \\( 0.9^{1} = 0.9 \\).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: None\n   - Potential counteroffers:\n       - I need to choose an offer such that my value from the remaining items is greater than 33. \n       - For full assessment, let's calculate some possible distributions and value them for me.\n       - A straightforward method is to keep the items that give me the highest value.\n\nLet's try offering a portion of lower value items first and evaluate my retained value:\n   \n   - Offer 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n     - Remaining for me:\n       - Item 1: 7 (Value = 7 * 71 = 497)\n       - Item 2: 1 (Value = 1 * 7 = 7)\n       - Item 3: 1 (Value = 1 * 4 = 4)\n       - Item 4: 5 (Value = 5 * 12 = 60)\n       - Item 5: 0 (Value = 0 * 33 = 0)\n     - Total value = 497 + 7 + 4 + 60 = 568\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - The value I retain (568) is much higher than my outside offer (33).\n   - This is an initial offer in which I retain much of the high-value items while still giving Player 2 a substantial share of the items. By retaining the higher-value items, I ensure that my position is clear and strong.\n\nGiven this analysis, I make the following proposal:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 3, 1]}\n```",

If a deal is accepted in round 2, it doesn't affect immediate calculations, but waiting may reduce value due to further discounting.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer [0, 0, 0, 2, 2] (being offered to me):\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n     - Total value = 36 + 56 = 92\n   - My value for the current offer (92) is far below my outside offer (391).\n\nGiven this analysis, the current offer is not acceptable as its value is significantly lower than the outside offer value. I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value above my outside offer.\n\n- Let's try offering [2, 2, 0, 4, 5] to Player 2, keeping for myself:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 (I keep both units)\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 28 = 0\n  - Total value = 96 + 70 + 10 + 18 + 0 = 194\n\nWhile 194 is still below the outside offer, further negotiation might yield better results. However, as this offer is more strategic, it could prompt the other player to raise value. Adjusting to maintain maximum or reasonable gains is key in negotiations.\n\nConsidering the current stance and future rounds, providing this counteroffer now is favorable.\n\nMy action is:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 4, 5]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 516. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 804 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 4, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 4, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 4, 4, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on an action, I will evaluate the options:\n\n1.

This doesn't impact the current decision since potential offers in round 3 would be less valuable due to further discounting.\n\n2. Assess the value of the offers:\n   - Current offer to me: [2, 2, 2, 0, 1]\n     - Value of items for me if I accept:\n       - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n       - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n       - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\n       - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 45 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 100 = 100\n     - Total value if I accept = 96 + 38 + 68 + 0 + 100 = 302\n\n   - My current offer to the other player: [3, 4, 4, 1, 2] was not accepted, so I need to assess the current offer versus making a counteroffer.\n\n3. Decision making:\n   The value of accepting the current offer (302) is significantly higher than my outside offer (47).

This affects the current value compared to my outside offer by considering the immediate round value versus a hypothetical future offer in round 3.\n\n### 2) Offer Value Assessment:\n\n- **Current Offer to Me:** [1, 3, 1, 1, 0]\n  - Value I receive if accepting this offer:\n    - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 20 = 20\n    - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 11 = 33\n    - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 16 = 16\n    - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 74 = 74\n    - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 94 = 0\n  - Total value to me if accepting: 20 + 33 + 16 + 74 + 0 = 143\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  Let's consider a potential counteroffer that improves my value over the outside offer adjusted for discount. Assume aiming for a value higher than 285, accounting for the discount, i.e., 285/0.9 \u2248 317.\n\n  Trying to maximize value while being reasonable, a counteroffer where:\n  - I keep more high-value items, specifically focusing on items 4 and 5 for which my values are highest.\n  - Potential counter: Offer to Player 2: [1, 2, 1, 0, 0] \n  - Value I receive if counteroffer is accepted:\n    - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 20 = 80\n    - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 11 = 44\n    - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 16 = 64\n    - Item 4: 5 units \u00d7 74 = 370\n    - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 94 = 188\n  - Total value: 80 + 44 + 64 + 370 + 188 = 746\n\n### 3) Decision:\n\n- **Accept the Current Offer?** No, as its value to me (143) is below my outside offer (285).\n- **Walk Away?** Not optimal now unless we cannot secure a better offer.\n- **Counteroffer?** Yes, propose a counteroffer to keep more valuable items to maximize my gain.\n\nGiven this analysis, my action will be to make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

The offer value is considerably less than my outside offer.\n\n   - Assess potential counteroffers:\n     - Ideally, any counteroffer should give me more than 580 in value. Let\u2019s propose keeping more high-value items:\n     - Offer Player 1: [1, 1, 0, 3, 2] \n     - My items: [4, 5, 5, 2, 0]\n       - Value = (4 * 82) + (5 * 23) + (5 * 95) + (2 * 58) + (0 * 44) \n                  = 328 + 115 + 475 + 116\n                  = 1034\n\n    This potential counteroffer gives me a total value of 1034, which is higher than my outside offer of 580.

This incentivizes reaching an agreement sooner to preserve the maximum value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**\n     - My total value of all items is 1091.\n     - I need to aim for an offer where my value is at least 1036 (my outside offer value) in this round since a future reduction in value from the discount factor would make it harder for me to achieve this target.\n     - Let's calculate a few potential counteroffer divisions for maximizing my value while offering something reasonable to Player 2:\n\n     For example, let's consider an offer where I propose to keep most high-value items:\n\n     Counteroffer: Giving Player 2:\n     - 2 units of Item 1\n     - 4 units of Item 2\n     - 1 unit of Item 3\n     - 2 units of Item 4\n     - 0 units of Item 5\n     \n     My received units (for this counteroffer):\n     - 3 units of Item 1 = 198\n     - 1 unit of Item 2 = 17\n     - 3 units of Item 3 = 258\n     - 2 units of Item 4 = 58\n     - 8 units of Item 5 = 216\n\n     Total value for me = 198 + 17 + 258 + 58 + 216 = 747\n\n     This value (747) is significantly below my outside offer value (1036).\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Given that the counteroffer above does not meet the minimum threshold of my outside offer value of 1036, I have to reconsider how I might re-distribute items to at least meet or exceed my outside offer value.\n   - However, given the way the item values are, achieving a sum close to 1036 might be challenging without possessing the majority of high-value items, which might be unfair to propose and lead to rejection without negotiation history.\n   - Another strategy would be to go with a high initial offer for potential negotiation rather than immediate walk-off but ensure the outcome is beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer that keeps as much of my valued items as needed to maximize my position while leaving room for potential negotiation in subsequent rounds.\n\nLet's propose a new counteroffer:\n\nCounteroffer: Giving Player 2:\n- 0 units of Item 1\n- 2 units of Item 2\n- 1 unit of Item 3\n- 3 units of Item 4\n- 4 units of Item 5\n\nMy received units (for this counteroffer):\n- 5 units of Item 1 = 330\n- 3 units of Item 2 = 51\n- 3 units of Item 3 = 258\n- 1 unit of Item 4 = 29\n- 4 units of Item 5 = 108\n\nTotal Value for me = 330 + 51 + 258 + 29 + 108 = 776\n\nUnfortunately, the 776 is still significantly lower than my outside offer of 1036. Balancing the units to beat the outside offer value and considering potential acceptance by the other player requires further attempts.\n\nIn light of the immediate issue, after careful re-calculation per iteration I would still end at values lower than my outside offer value if I wish to leave something reasonable for negotiation later on.\n\nThus **Action:** {\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n\nThis is based on the current private offer guarantee being significantly higher, ensuring a completely valid beneficial outcome secured by my calculated approach without direct conflict with projected discounts or negotiation faults in forthcoming rounds.",

Making a counteroffer that focuses on maximizing high-value items (item 1, item 2, item 4) is critical. I will propose keeping all units of item 1, item 2, and item 4, while offering the remainder. \n\nLet's make a counteroffer that gives:\n\n- Offer item 3 and some of item 5 to Player 1, keeping higher-value items primarily for me.\n\n- Proposed counteroffer to Player 1: [0, 1, 0, 8, 9]\n\nCalculating the value for this counteroffer to ensure it exceeds the outside offer:\n- My share: [4, 4, 2, 0, 1]\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 388\n  - 4 units of item 2 = 396\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 166\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 14\n- Total value = 964\n\nHowever, this is still less than my outside offer; thus, crafting another proposal or using more strategic distributions might be necessary.

                    "response": "To analyze and decide on the action to take, let's follow the steps one by one:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1313.\n   - The values of the items involved are:\n     - Item 1: 100\n     - Item 2: 77\n     - Item 3: 42\n     - Item 4: 98\n     - Item 5: 89\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 8 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - There is no current offer. I can make the initial offer.\n   - The discount factor, gamma, is 0.9, which means values reduce with each round if negotiations continue.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - I need to make an initial offer. I should select an allocation that gives me a value that is better than my outside option, 1313.\n   - Calculate some potential allocations to propose.\n     - Let\u2019s consider keeping as many high-value items as possible while sharing others minimally.\n\n     For example:\n     - Proposal: Give Player 2 [0 items of item 1, 1 item of item 2, 1 item of item 3, 4 items of item 4, 1 item of item 5]\n     \n     Value to me if I keep:\n     - 2 items of item 1: 2 \u00d7 100 = 200\n     - 4 items of item 2: 4 \u00d7 77 = 308\n     - 2 items of item 3: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n     - 4 items of item 4: 4 \u00d7 98 = 392\n     - 2 items of item 5: 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n     \n     Total value = 200 + 308 + 84 + 392 + 178 = 1162\n\n   - This potential division gives me a value of 1162, which is below my outside option value of 1313. Hence, I need to revise the allocation to maximize my value.\n\n   Let's adjust the proposal for a better offer:\n   - Proposal: Give Player 2 [0 items of item 1, 1 item of item 2, 1 item of item 3, 3 items of item 4, 1 item of item 5]\n\n   Value to me if I keep:\n   - 2 items of item 1: 2 \u00d7 100 = 200\n   - 4 items of item 2: 4 \u00d7 77 = 308\n   - 2 items of item 3: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n   - 5 items of item 4: 5 \u00d7 98 = 490\n   - 2 items of item 5: 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n\n   Total value = 200 + 308 + 84 + 490 + 178 = 1260\n\n   - This revised proposal still has value less than my outside option. I should walk away, as I can't reach a satisfactory proposal in this initial attempt.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Given the calculations, the best offer I could think of doesn't meet my outside offer's value. Considering the values and my outside option, I will WALK.\n\n   {\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

In round 1, this does not impact the current value but will in future rounds.\n\n2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n   - Current offer ([2, 1, 1, 1, 1]) gives me:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 94 = 94\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n     - Total value for the current offer = 6 + 53 + 82 + 94 + 3 = 238\n   - Since the current offer value (238) is greater than my outside offer (237), it is already slightly better.\n   - However, considering the presence of more valuable items like item 3 and item 4, I could instead maximize my value through negotiation. A reasonable counteroffer could aim to increase my share of these items further while still ensuring a value above 237.\n\n3) Make a Decision:\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me a value slightly above my outside offer, but because there's potential to increase it further, I will instead propose a counteroffer.\n   - I notice the significant values I get from items 3 and 4. Let me propose a counteroffer to increase my number of these items.\n\nLet's consider a situation where I take 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5:\n\n- This offer would leave:\n  - [3, 3, 1, 1, 2] units for Player 1.\n\nFor such a division keeping:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 94 = 188\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n- Total value for this division = 6 + 53 + 246 + 188 + 3 = 496\n\nBy considering the counteroffer that gives me 496 value, which is substantively greater than my current and outside offers, the counteroffer would maximize my payoff quite effectively.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 392. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 3, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means accepting offers sooner rather than later is generally more valuable.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer (from Player 2 to me): [3, 3, 1, 1, 2]\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 68 = 68\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n     - Total value = 638\n\n   Since this is round 2, the value of accepting the current offer now would be 638 \u00d7 0.9^1 = 638 \u00d7 0.9 = 574.2.\n\n   - Compare this value to my outside offer value of 392: 574.2 > 392, which makes accepting more attractive than my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - The value of the current offer, after adjusting for the discount rate, is significantly higher than my outside offer value.\n   - Given the higher value compared to my outside offer and the possibility of Player 2 not accepting a more favorable counteroffer, it's beneficial for me to accept the current offer.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Let's attempt a better value configuration:\n\n- Offer Player 2: \\( [0, 4, 1, 3, 0] \\)\n- Keeping for me: 2 units of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5.\n- My total value:\n  - 190 (2 units of Item 1)\n  - 28 (2 units of Item 2)\n  - 184 (2 units of Item 3)\n  - 53 (1 unit of Item 4)\n  - 136 (2 units of Item 5)\n  - Total: \\(190 + 28 + 184 + 53 + 136 = 591\\), also less than my fallback.\n\nLet's further improve:\n- Offer Player 2: [0, 3, 1, 3, 0] \n  - Keeping: 2 units of Item 1, 3 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5.\n  - My total value:\n    - 190 (2 units of Item 1)\n    - 42 (3 units of Item 2)\n    - 184 (2 units of Item 3)\n    - 53 (1 unit of Item 4)\n    - 136 (2 units of Item 5)\n    - Total: \\(190 + 42 + 184 + 53 + 136 = 605\\)\n\nNone of these counteroffers get me above 788, so the viable strategy is to retain each item's contribution carefully. If it seems I'll gain substantially by retaining all valuable items for myself or marginally adjust:\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n- Since I cannot beat my external offer easily in this first round, and given the uncertainty about Player 2's willingness to accept the offer, I choose to initiate by offering a reasonable split to probe, with slight preference to essential items except:\n  \n   Offer Player 2: `[0, 3, 1, 3, 1]` \n\n- Retaining: 2 units of Item 1, 3 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5.\n- My total value: \n  - 190 (2 units of Item 1)\n  - 42 (3 units of Item 2)\n  - 184 (2 units of Item 3)\n  - 53 (1 unit of Item 4)\n  - 68 (1 unit of Item 5)\n  - Total: \\(190 + 42 + 184 + 53 + 68 = 537\\)\n\nThis configuration still leaves room for future negotiation rounds, as the current gain is not preferable to my outside option (falling short), but further opportunities may adjust values. This is merely a probing first-round strategy.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 3, 1]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1157. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 876 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on my initial action, I'll walk through the steps provided:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 1157.\n   - The values per unit of each item to me are:\n     - Item 1: 37\n     - Item 2: 87\n     - Item 3: 76\n     - Item 4: 48\n     - Item 5: 44\n   - The total pool of items:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor gamma is 0.9. As we are in Round 1, if I make an offer and it is accepted, there will be no discount applied yet.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer on the table for me to assess.\n   - I must propose an initial offer. I need to consider that the total present value of items I'll keep should ideally be greater than my outside offer (1157).\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Analyzing potential counteroffers:\n     - I need to ensure that the total value of the items I keep is greater than or equal to my outside offer to consider the offer worthwhile.\n     - Some potential offers might include giving fewer high-value items to maximize the value I retain.\n\nLet's calculate a plausible initial offer:\n\nLet's say I consider offering Player 2 possibly half (or nearest reasonable split) of each item type while ensuring the value of items I keep exceeds 1157.\n\nFor example, consider the value-to-me of each unit of the total items if I give Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\n\nLet's check if keeping the remainder aligns with strategic maximization:\n- My items:\n  - Items I'm keeping: 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 2 of item 5.\n  - Values of items to me:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 44 = 88\n  - Total value to me = 74 + 174 + 152 + 144 + 88 = 632\n    \nHowever, since 632 is significantly less than my outside offer, this isn't satisfactory.\n\nI'll consider another division to maximize items with the highest value and closer to my offer threshold. High-value items are item 2 and item 3, so I should bias towards keeping them:\n\nOffer 1 unit each of items 1, 4, 5, but keep the maximum of items 2 and 3.\n\nCalculate this offer's effect:\n\n- Offer to Player 2:\n  - 1 unit of item 1, 3 of item 4, 4 of item 5\n- I keep:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 74\n  - 4 units of item 2 = 348\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 228\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 144\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 44\n- Total value to me: 74 + 348 + 228 + 144 + 44 = 838\n\nThis is still not sufficient compared to my outside offer. \n\nI will further rationalize, aiming to keep combinations focusing on maximizing items 2 and 3:\n\nGive less of items that are crucial for my own gain while trying to entice by still making an acceptable offer:\n\nOffering closest minimal such that a negotiation consideration arises:\n- Offer none of item 2, less of items 1, 3, and reasonable redistribution of 4 and 5 since item 4 though large, does not contribute a lot per unit to my outside offer.\nAttempt another:\n- Offer: [0, 0, 0, 4, 5]\n\n- Results in:\n  - Keep: 3 of item 1 = 111\n  - Keep: 4 of item 2 = 348\n  - Keep: 3 of item 3 = 228\n  - None of item 4 = 0\n  - None of item 5 = 0\n  - Total calculated value to me: 111 + 348 + 228 = 687.\n\nThis doesn't meet my outside offer, so I'll consider the offer that maximizes value closer to outside share:\n\nAttempt to propose counter as:\n- More rational offer setup:\n\nKeeping in mind splitting equality, and restating divisive negotiation if this final thinking.\n\nPostulate maximal value items 2, present further through my:\n- Offer Setup: [1, 2, 1, 2, 4]\n\nSo dynamically calculating for total attraction finally present:\n\n- Maximal gotten: \n  - 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 of 3, 4 of 4, inclusion offer.\n  \nI believe an optimal strategic candidate better max: \n- Offer: [1, 2, 1, 2, 4]\n\nGiven continual assuring higher option relative comparison will fill:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 2, 4]}\n```",

However, since this is the first round, it has no immediate impact.\n\n2) **Value Assessment for Offers:**\n   - There is no current offer to evaluate.\n   - I will calculate the total value if I retain the most valuable items for myself. Let's say I keep:\n     - 3 units of item 1 (285 value)\n     - 3 units of item 2 (120 value)\n     - 6 units of item 3 (288 value)\n     - 1 unit of item 4 (68 value)\n     - 2 units of item 5 (100 value)\n     \n     The other player would receive:\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 0 unit of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n     \n     My calculated value in this case would be:\n     - 3\u00d795 + 3\u00d740 + 6\u00d748 + 1\u00d768 + 2\u00d750 = 285 + 120 + 288 + 68 + 100 = 861\n   \n   - Compare the above value (861) to my outside offer (1077). My offer needs improvement since the calculated value is less than 1077.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - My offer must generate a value greater than 1077 for me.\n   - I'll adjust to keep all of item 1 (4 units) since it has the highest value, then a different combination for improvement:\n     - 4 units of item 1 (380 value)\n     - 3 units of item 2 (120 value)\n     - 5 units of item 3 (240 value)\n     - 1 unit of item 4 (68 value)\n     - 2 units of item 5 (100 value)\n   \n   Total Value = 380 + 120 + 240 + 68 + 100 = 908\n\n   Since 908 < 1077, I need to revise further. Let me try keeping less to improve the outcome value with respect to my outside offer. The situation is clear; anything below 1077 is unsatisfactory.\n\n   Final decision and offer:\n   - Offer other player 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 5, while I keep:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5 (4, 2, 3, 1, 2)\n   \n   This yields:\n   - 4\u00d795 + 2\u00d740 + 3\u00d748 + 1\u00d768 + 2\u00d750 = 380 + 80 + 144 + 68 + 100 = 772\n\n   I realize my action ought to allow room for negotiation benefit through a counteroffer. As none yet satisfies exceeding the critical, it suggests strategic & probable assertive \u2018WALK\u2019 appears the prudent decision.\n\n   - Therefore, I should walk away based on my values still being unaligned with outside guaranteed reward.\n\nFinal Decision:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the negotiation goes to a further round, my potential gain is multiplied by 0.9. \n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Currently, there is no offer on the table, so I need to consider what competitive offer could benefit me most while also being potentially attractive to Player 2.\n   - Calculate the total value based on different divisions, ensuring my value exceeds 275 after accounting for the discount.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - My objective is to maximize my value and ensure it is greater than the outside offer value.\n\nGiven that it is round 1, I should try to propose an initial offer that ensures I receive a higher value than 275 in current terms or in future rounds when multiplied by gamma.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "1) **Current Situation Analysis**:\n   - My outside offer value is 677.\n   - My values per unit of each item are:\n     - Item 1: 18\n     - Item 2: 76\n     - Item 3: 28\n     - Item 4: 56\n     - Item 5: 84\n   - The total pool of items is 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor of 0.9 means the longer the negotiation goes, the less valuable future outcomes become. However, since it's round 1, the discount won't affect a final decision made now.\n\n2) **Value Assessment**:\n   - For the current offer: I'm being offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1].\n     - Value = (1 x 18) + (1 x 76) + (0 x 28) + (0 x 56) + (1 x 84) = 18 + 76 + 0 + 0 + 84 = 178\n   - Compare this value of 178 to my outside offer value of 677:\n     - The current offer provides much less value than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Decision**:\n   - Accepting the current offer is not reasonable since 178 is much lower than 677.\n   - Walking away guarantees me a value of 677, which is currently better than the value of the ongoing offer.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my total value, aiming to get at least the value of my outside offer.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer. Ideally, I want to keep a combination of items where total value is higher than my outside offer:\n\n- If I propose to give Player 1 the following: [3, 0, 3, 3, 2], I keep [2, 1, 2, 1, 3].\n\n  Total value for me:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 x 18 = 36\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 x 76 = 76\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 x 28 = 56\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 x 56 = 56\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 x 84 = 252\n\n  Total value = 36 + 76 + 56 + 56 + 252 = 476\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer, but I want to test Player 1's willingness to concede more. However, this is a risky move as it doesn't surpass my outside offer, but it can set a tone for negotiation improvement. Walking might be the ultimate option if future offers remain low.\n\nTherefore, I will propose this counteroffer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 3, 3, 2]}\n```",

Since we are in round 1, the discount factor for this round is \\( \\gamma^{0} = 1 \\).\n   - Hence, any decision based on item values isn't affected by the discount factor in this particular round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer (Offered to Me): [1, 2, 2, 1, 0]**\n   - My total value if I accept:\n     - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 64 = 64\n     - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 20 = 40\n     - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 100 = 200\n     - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 72 = 72\n     - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 3 = 0\n   - Total value = 64 + 40 + 200 + 72 + 0 = 376\n\n2. **Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n   - Current Offer Value (376) < Outside Offer Value (544)\n\n3. **Potential Counteroffer:**\n   - Given that I'm looking to exceed a value of 544, let's consider keeping 3 units of item 3 and a couple of the valuable units from other items while offering minimal common-value items to Player 1. \n\n### Step 3: Decide on Action\n\nSince the current offer is less than my outside offer value, I should propose a counteroffer that achieves a value of at least 544.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal:**\n- Offer Player 1: [1, 4, 2, 2, 0] (I keep: [3, 0, 1, 2, 0])\n\n**Value Calculation for Counteroffer:**\n- Items I keep:\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 64 = 192\n  - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 20 = 0\n  - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 100 = 100\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n  - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n- Total Value = 192 + 0 + 100 + 144 + 0 = 436\n\nThe value of this counteroffer is still below my outside offer value. However, it's the first round, and a slightly strategic risk is necessary considering long-term negotiations. It might entice player 1 to respond with a better offer.\n\nThus, I will proceed with this counteroffer for negotiation, aiming to increase my value prospects in the following rounds:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 2, 2, 0]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 4, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 4, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

However, in a negotiation context, it positions me better than accepting or initially proposed splits.\n\n### Decision\nThe current offer is below my outside offer value. A proposed counteroffer allows re-negotiation and potential improvement in subsequent rounds since the discount factor still preserves significant value in this early round.

Currently, there is no offer on the table, so there is nothing to accept. This means my options are to propose a counteroffer or walk away and take my outside offer.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   Since there's no offer on the table yet, I\u2019ll calculate a potential offer. \n\n   For simplicity, I'll start by considering keeping the high-value items for myself and offering lower value items to Player 2 to maximize my total value:\n\n   **Proposed Offer to Player 2:**\n   - Offer them 2 units of item 1 (leaving me 4)\n   - Offer them 1 unit of item 2 (leaving me 3)\n   - Offer them 0 units of item 3 (leaving me 2)\n   - Offer them 4 units of item 4 (leaving me 4)\n   - Offer them 1 unit of item 5 (leaving me 1)\n\n   **My Total Value from Keeping:**\n   - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 97 = 388\n   - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 18 = 54\n   - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 56 = 112\n   - Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 100 = 400\n   - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 47 = 47\n\n   Total value = 388 + 54 + 112 + 400 + 47 = 1001\n\n   This is below my outside offer of 1100. Therefore, I need to adjust to achieve a deal better than the outside offer.\n\n   I'll reconsider:\n\n   **Proposed More Favorable Offer to Player 2:**\n   - Offer them 0 units of item 1 (leaving me 6)\n   - Offer them 0 units of item 2 (leaving me 4)\n   - Offer them 1 unit of item 3 (leaving me 1)\n   - Offer them 0 units of item 4 (leaving me 8)\n   - Offer them 0 units of item 5 (leaving me 2)\n\n   **My Total Value from Keeping:**\n   - Item 1: 6 units \u00d7 97 = 582\n   - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 18 = 72\n   - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 56 = 56\n   - Item 4: 8 units \u00d7 100 = 800\n   - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 47 = 94\n\n   Total value = 582 + 72 + 56 + 800 + 94 = 1604\n\n   Now, this potential offer provides a total value of 1604 to me, which is way above my outside offer of 1100. \n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\nI will start by proposing this offer to Player 2 to maximize my value, as it provides a higher value to me than the outside offer.\n\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 282. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 864 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that acceptance in future rounds reduces the effective value according to the formula: value * 0.9^(round-1).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer on the table to evaluate.\n   - Calculating the total value if I kept all items (i.e., I offer zero units of each item to the other player):\n     - Total value = 3*44 + 3*4 + 5*9 + 2*27 + 8*72\n     - Total value = 132 (item 1) + 12 (item 2) + 45 (item 3) + 54 (item 4) + 576 (item 5)\n     - Total value = 819\n      \n     As the total value (819) is significantly higher than my outside offer (11), it's beneficial to negotiate.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Since there's no offer to accept and my outside offer is much lower than the potential value I can receive, proposing a counteroffer makes sense.\n   - I will propose a counteroffer where I still keep a significant portion of the value. Let's try:\n     - Offer Player 2 a small portion of items but try to keep high-value items:\n     - Offer: [1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5].\n     - My share, under this offer:\n       - Item 1: 2*44 = 88\n       - Item 2: 2*4 = 8\n       - Item 3: 4*9 = 36\n       - Item 4: 2*27 = 54\n       - Item 5: 4*72 = 288\n     - Total value = 88 + 8 + 36 + 54 + 288 = 474\n\n   This offer gives me a total value of 474, which exceeds my outside offer of 11 by a large margin. \n\nHere's my action based on the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 4]}\n```",

I will propose a counteroffer that aims to increase my total value above the 914 benchmark.\n\n**Counteroffer Strategy**:\n- Focus on items with higher personal values: Items 1, 4, and 5.\n- Consider a distribution that maximizes my value while still being reasonable for Player 1.\n\nLet's try offering:\n- Give Player 1: [0, 2, 2, 1, 3] \n  - I receive: [3, 1, 3, 1, 5]\n  - **My Value Calculation**:\n    - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 81 = 243\n    - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 22 = 22\n    - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 27 = 81\n    - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 76 = 76\n    - Item 5: 5 units \u00d7 56 = 280\n    - **Total Value** = 243 + 22 + 81 + 76 + 280 = 702\n\n702 is still less than my outside offer. However, to maximize negotiation chances, let's try a slightly more skewed offer:\n\n- New Counteroffer:\n  - Give Player 1: [0, 1, 3, 1, 4]\n  - I receive: [3, 2, 2, 1, 4]\n  - **My Value Calculation**:\n    - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 81 = 243\n    - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 22 = 44\n    - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 27 = 54\n    - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 76 = 76\n    - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 56 = 224\n    - **Total Value** = 243 + 44 + 54 + 76 + 224 = 641\n\nAlthough 641 is still below my outside option, it seeks a potentially acceptable compromise to move the negotiation forward, given the constraints of sharing the total items. \n\nHowever, based on this computation, another attempt would focus even more on item 1 and 5:\n- **Final Counteroffer**:\n  - Give Player 1: [1, 2, 3, 0, 4]\n  - I receive: [2, 1, 2, 2, 4]\n  - **My Value Calculation**:\n    - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 81 = 162\n    - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 22 = 22\n    - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 27 = 54\n    - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 76 = 152\n    - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 56 = 224\n    - **Total Value** = 162 + 22 + 54 + 152 + 224 = 614\n\n**As 614 is not above 914 and I'm unable to formulate a better counteroffer within the constraints**, optimization indicates the negotiations won't pass the outside offer value.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 548. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 861 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

                    "response": "To determine my action, let's evaluate the current situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 1121.\n   - **Values of the items involved:** My values per item are:\n     - Item 1: 55\n     - Item 2: 31\n     - Item 3: 30\n     - Item 4: 8\n     - Item 5: 82\n   - **Total pool of items:** There are 9 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n   - **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means if a deal is reached in later rounds, the effective value of the agreement will be reduced. Thus, making an advantageous deal early is preferable.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** No current offer is on the table since this is round 1, and I am expected to make the initial offer.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** \n     - My aim is to propose a division where my retained value from the items is greater than 1121, while attempting to leave some flexible value for Player 2.\n     - Let's consider keeping a high value of the high-value items and propose a counteroffer where I retain more values. \n    \n   Let's evaluate a possible offer where I keep:\n   - 7 units of item 1: \\(7 \\times 55 = 385\\)\n   - 3 units of item 2: \\(3 \\times 31 = 93\\)\n   - 3 units of item 3: \\(3 \\times 30 = 90\\)\n   - 2 units of item 4: \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\)\n   - 4 units of item 5: \\(4 \\times 82 = 328\\)\n   \n   Total value = \\(385 + 93 + 90 + 16 + 328 = 912\\)\n\n   The proposed offer to Player 2 would be:\n   - 2 units of item 1\n   - 2 units of item 2\n   - 2 units of item 3\n   - 0 units of item 4\n   - 1 unit of item 5\n   \n   My total value retained would be 912, which is significantly less than my outside offer value of 1121. So, I need to propose a more favorable offer to myself.\n\n   Let's adjust to retain:\n   - 8 units of item 1, offer 1 to Player 2.\n   - 4 units of item 2, offer 1 to Player 2.\n   - 4 units of item 3, offer 1 to Player 2.\n   - 2 units of item 4, offer 0 to Player 2.\n   - 5 units of item 5, offer 0 to Player 2.\n\n   My retained value would be:\n   - \\(8 \\times 55 = 440\\)\n   - \\(4 \\times 31 = 124\\)\n   - \\(4 \\times 30 = 120\\)\n   - \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\)\n   - \\(5 \\times 82 = 410\\)\n   \n   Total retained value = \\(440 + 124 + 120 + 16 + 410 = 1110\\)\n\n   Even with this configuration, it's slightly below my outside offer.

Hence, I need a much more aggressive stance.\n\nReassessing to offer:\n   - 4 units of item 1 \n   - 0 units of item 2 \n   - 0 units of item 3 \n   - 0 units of item 4 \n   - 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis leaves me with:\n   - 4 units of item 1: 48\n   - 2 units of item 2: 114\n   - 2 units of item 3: 74\n   - 1 units of item 5: 69\n\nTotal = 48 + 114 + 74 + 69 = 305, still undervalued.

This affects the net present value of any negotiated deal.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nGiven that there is no current offer, I'll calculate a potential offer scenario. The goal is to construct a division where the value to me is higher than my outside offer value of 257.\n\nLet's consider keeping a major portion of high-value items for myself to ensure the value exceeds 257:\n\n#### Example Counteroffer to Player 2:\n- **Offer to Player 2**:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit\n  - Item 2: 0 unit\n  - Item 3: 3 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 1 unit\n\n- **Items I Keep**:\n  - Item 1: 5 units (5 x 55 = 275)\n  - Item 2: 1 unit (1 x 49 = 49)\n  - Item 3: 3 units (3 x 22 = 66)\n  - Item 4: 3 units (3 x 19 = 57)\n  - Item 5: 1 unit (1 x 2 = 2)\n\n**Total Value to Me**: 275 + 49 + 66 + 57 + 2 = 449\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**: There is no offer to accept.\n- **Should I Walk Away?**: Walking away now gives me a sure value of 257.\n- **Should I Make a Counteroffer?**: A counteroffer that provides me a value of 449 is definitely better than my outside offer of 257, assuming Player 2 is willing to accept it or counter close enough to it.\n\nGiven this calculation from an initial proposal, I should make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 3, 3, 1]}\n```",

I will aim for a division where I keep the maximum value items. I want the total value of my retained items to exceed my outside offer value.\n   - Let's calculate a potential offer:\n     - Offer Player 2 one unit of item 1, one unit of item 2, four units of item 3, two units of item 4, and three units of item 5.\n     - This offer allows me to keep:\n       - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 58 = 174\n       - 2 units of item 2: 2 * 70 = 140\n       - 0 units of item 3: 0 * 2 = 0\n       - 3 units of item 4: 3 * 45 = 135\n       - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 44 = 88\n     - Total value retained = 174 + 140 + 0 + 135 + 88 = 537.\n\n   Although 537 is below my outside offer of 665, it's essential to see if my strategy of gradually conceding gives room for a deal over the next rounds. However, since the initial retention isn't exceeding my outside offer, another strategy must be proposed.\n\n   - Since this offer does not exceed my outside offer value, the best approach might be offering less initially and adjusting in subsequent rounds while still maximizing my held values. Let's adjust it:\n\n     Proposed offer to Player 2:\n     - Offer one unit of item 1, two units of item 2, four units of item 3, two units of item 4, and two units of item 5.\n     - I retain:\n       - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 58 = 174\n       - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 70 = 70\n       - 0 units of item 3: 0 * 2 = 0\n       - 3 units of item 4: 3 * 45 = 135\n       - 3 units of item 5: 3 * 44 = 132\n     - Total value retained = 174 + 70 + 0 + 135 + 132 = 511.\n\n   Note that my total value is still below my outside option. However, since this is the first round, it might be exploratory to start with a division and see if it suits Player 2, expecting a counter or adjustment in upcoming rounds if possible. Ensuring it's ended profitably in the final round could be more strategic for a counterbalance.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 4, 2, 2]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 260. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 648 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

The current offer is significantly lower than my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n- I should not ACCEPT the current offer as 503 is much lower than my outside offer of 1216.\n- WALK would give me a guaranteed 1216, which is preferable to the current offer.\n- Consider a counteroffer. I\u2019ll need a distribution that gets my value as close as possible to 1216.\n\nLet's construct a counteroffer:\n\nI want to aim for a value above at least 1216 if this were the last round:\n- Allocating myself all of item 3 (5 units), item 4 (5 units) which is high value for me:\n\n  Max possible from items 3 and 4:\n  - Item 3: 5 \u00d7 62 = 310\n  - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 97 = 485\n  - Remaining pool post current offer use:\n    - Item 1: 3 units left\n    - Item 2: 2 units left\n    - Item 5: 6 units left\n\nMy attempt is to maximize item 1 further:\n  - Take all of item 1: 3 \u00d7 97 = 291\n\nWith these allocations, I reach a value:\n- Item 1: 291\n- Item 3: 310\n- Item 4: 485 \nTotal = 1086\n\nThis total is still below my outside offer, indicating I should consider leaving more items towards item 5 instead to improve bargaining, without hitting below the required value. Given the complexity and valuation, keeping my position strong is necessary:\n\nGiven this, since actual reduction isn't enough from 1361 to my offer, any other allocation risks value generation. Rather than counter unbalanced, opting for WALK in this scenario is more strategically safe choice as offers nearer value 1216 upon a counter won\u2019t ensure player\u2019s own agreement and undesirable lose option similarly.\n\nTherefore, the best option is to:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

I'll keep a large portion of the most valuable items for myself and offer the rest strategically.\n\n   A possible offer could involve:\n   - Offering Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\n   Calculating my value for this setup:\n   - **My kept units and value:**\n     - Item 1: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 33 = 33\n     - Item 2: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 55 = 55\n     - Item 3: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n     - Item 4: 5 units = 5 \u00d7 87 = 435\n     - Item 5: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273\n   - **Total value to me:** 33 + 55 + 30 + 435 + 273 = 826\n\n   This proposed offer gives me a total value of 826, which is slightly below my outside offer. To ensure negotiations stay flexible, I will adjust slightly to maintain a higher value than 875.\n\n   Adjusting to keep a better portion:\n   - Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   - **Re-calculated my kept units and value:**\n     - Item 1: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n     - Item 2: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n     - Item 3: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n     - Item 4: 6 units = 6 \u00d7 87 = 522\n     - Item 5: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 91 = 364\n   - **New total value to me:** 66 + 110 + 60 + 522 + 364 = 1122\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n    - The new offer I propose allows me a value of 1122, which is above my outside offer of 875, securing a better outcome for me in this initial round.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

I should aim for a minimum personal value equal or exceeding the discounted future outside offer value if not achievable immediately.\n   \n   Let's construct a counteroffer that exceeds 368, considering the discounting implication of future rounds. I'll target a substantial part of the higher-value items like item 1 and item 4. For example, I could propose giving Player 1 as minimal of the high-value items as possible while ensuring a fair division.\n\n   Proposed counteroffer to Player 1: [1, 4, 3, 1, 1].\n   - Value to me:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 80 = 80\n     - 2 units left (earned) of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 12 = 24\n     - 2 units left (earned) of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 16 = 32\n     - 3 units left (earned) of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n     - 1 unit left (earned) of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 28 = 28\n     - Total value = 80 + 24 + 32 + 153 + 28 = 317\n\n   Even though 317 is less than the outside offer, future negotiation rounds may allow for better offers without ending the negotiation immediately.\n\nGiven the situation and prediction about future offers, a cautious counter-offering strategy is preferred this round.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 3, 1, 1]}\n```",

Since we are in round 2, any future offer would be multiplied by 0.9. This implies that the value I derive is decreased as the rounds progress, making it more beneficial to conclude earlier if possible.\n\n2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n   - My current offer from Player 2 [1, 4, 3, 1, 1]:\n     - Value for item 1: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n     - Value for item 2: 4 \u00d7 37 = 148\n     - Value for item 3: 3 \u00d7 67 = 201\n     - Value for item 4: 1 \u00d7 59 = 59\n     - Value for item 5: 1 \u00d7 80 = 80\n     - Total current offer value = 4 + 148 + 201 + 59 + 80 = 492\n\n   The value of 492 is lower than my outside offer of 499. Therefore, the current offer is not better than walking away.\n\n3) Decision Making:\n   - I should not accept the current offer because 492 (offer) < 499 (outside offer).\n   - Walking away would give me 499, which is better than what is on the table.\n   - I can propose a counteroffer that aims to maximize my gain while being acceptable to Player 2 to improve my outcome over my outside offer. \n\n   Let's compute a potential counteroffer.

Thus, it seems challenging, considering the total pool's full value.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nGiven the above, if I cannot receive at least value 933 from available items, and considering a future discounted value by the rounds, it seems I should propose a position that might entice counteroffers from Player 2:\n\n- Counteroffer:\n  - 0 units of item 1 for Player 2 (I keep 1)\n  - 3 units of item 2 for Player 2 (I keep 1)\n  - 3 units of item 3 for Player 2 (I keep 0)\n  - 5 units of item 4 for Player 2 (I keep 1)\n  - 2 units of item 5 for Player 2 (I keep 1)\n\nThis counteroffer results in a balance between pressure on Player 2 and negotiations going forward into better counteroffers in successive rounds.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 3, 5, 2]}",

However, with the distribution of item values and the high outside offer, any feasible counteroffer would likely still be below my outside offer after considering the round discount.\n   - As the current value offered is far below my outside offer and any logical improvement in offers through a counteroffer would not reach my outside offer, it makes sense to opt for the outside offer.\n\nBased on this reasoning, my action will be:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This influences the negotiation by reducing the value of later rounds, with current value being highest, thus emphasizing the strategic importance of making decisions earlier rather than later.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer to me by Player 1 is [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 70 = 140\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 77 = 154\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n     - Total value = 140 + 29 + 154 + 13 + 152 = 488\n   - The current offer value (488) is significantly less than my outside offer value (657).\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Given that the current offer value to me is lower than my outside offer, I should not accept.\n   - Walking away would guarantee me the outside offer of 657, so it is currently more advantageous than accepting.\n   - However, a counteroffer could be structured to see if a better division that maximizes my value is possible. Let\u2019s consider what counteroffer could maximize my value while still enticing Player 1:\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that aims to maximize my value without immediately risking a walk. I'll propose a division such that my share of these items exceeds my outside offer value, mitigating risk while optimizing gains.\n\n   - Let\u2019s consider proposing: [3, 1, 3, 1, 2] to Player 1:\n     - I keep: 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 70 = 350\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n     - Total value to me = 350 + 87 + 231 + 39 + 152 = 859, which exceeds my outside offer value.\n\nThis proposed counteroffer aims to get a better value from the negotiation while attempting to keep it attractive to Player 1. \n\nThus, the action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 3, 1, 2]}\n```",

Given this is round 1, the discount factor is not applied yet (i.e., 1.0).\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer:** None yet.\n  \n- **Assessing Potential Counteroffers:**\n  Let's propose a division and calculate the value to me. I need a value greater than my outside offer (1095).\n\nSuppose I propose to give:\n- Item 1: 3 units to Player 2, I keep 4 units.\n- Item 2: 3 units to Player 2, I keep 3 units.\n- Item 3: 1 unit to Player 2, I keep 2 units.\n- Item 4: 2 units to Player 2, I keep 2 units.\n- Item 5: 2 units to Player 2, I keep 3 units.\n\n**Calculate my Value from this Division:**\n- Value from Item 1: 4 units * 25 = 100\n- Value from Item 2: 3 units * 94 = 282\n- Value from Item 3: 2 units * 76 = 152\n- Value from Item 4: 2 units * 37 = 74\n- Value from Item 5: 3 units * 48 = 144\n  \nTotal value = 100 + 282 + 152 + 74 + 144 = 752\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 1095. Thus, this proposed division is not favorable.\n\nTo maximize my value, I must ensure that the total value to me is higher than 1095, even after applying the discount factor in future rounds.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\nGiven the high value of my outside offer, I should aim for a deal that gives me significantly more than 1095 to account for possible counteroffers from the other player. This means I should aim to keep a majority of the higher-value items for myself. \n\nHere's a revised proposal:\n- Item 1: 2 units to Player 2, I keep 5 units.\n- Item 2: 1 unit to Player 2, I keep 5 units.\n- Item 3: 0 units to Player 2, I keep 3 units.\n- Item 4: 1 unit to Player 2, I keep 3 units.\n- Item 5: 1 unit to Player 2, I keep 4 units.\n\n**Calculate the Value of this Offer:**\n- Value from Item 1: 5 units * 25 = 125\n- Value from Item 2: 5 units * 94 = 470\n- Value from Item 3: 3 units * 76 = 228\n- Value from Item 4: 3 units * 37 = 111\n- Value from Item 5: 4 units * 48 = 192\n\nTotal value = 125 + 470 + 228 + 111 + 192 = 1126\n\nThis offer gives me a value of 1126, which is slightly above my outside option of 1095, thus making it a valid offer to propose initially.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Therefore, a prompt resolution is preferable, but only if it is above my outside offer value of 721.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I should propose a division that maximizes my value above my outside offer.\n\n   Let's calculate potential offers:\n   - One approach is to aim for a total value slightly above my outside offer, considering the discount in future rounds.\n   - If I keep all units for Item 1 and Item 3, and split the rest, I would receive:\n     - 3 units of Item 1: 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n     - 4 units of Item 3: 4 \u00d7 79 = 316\n     - Thus, I'd start by offering Player 2 no Items 1 and 3, and none of Item 2 (since there\u2019s only one unit):\n     - Assign all units of Item 4 and 5 to Player 2 initially, then modify to make a feasible offer without revealing my valuation.\n   - Potential counteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 3, 4]\n\n   However, I must test to ensure this division gives me a total greater than or equal to 721 with future adjustments.\n\n   - Total my value in this scenario:\n     - I keep: 3 units Item 1 (270) + 1 unit Item 2 (0) + 4 units Item 3 (316) = **586** \n     - This total is under 721, so I need to adjust.\n  \n   Adjustments needed: Give more low-value items or another strategy shift in counters, while making it maintainable for Player 2 to agree potentially on future rounds.\n\nI will next calculate an adjusted proposal. If I want to make at least 721, I must propose:\n   - [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5] such that I achieve value = 721 + buffer against next values after discounting:\n   - Say, giving 2 items of Item 3:\n     - Remaining: 2 items with my valuation.\n     - Recalculate:\n       - [0, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n\nFinal calculation for outcome through safer custom planning for least follow-ups:\n   - My kept in terms:\n     - 3 item 1, 1 item 2, 2 item 3, 2 item 4, 2 item 5.\n\nOverall total should be comfortably above my outside offer if calculated correctly.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 477. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 570 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 3, 3, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 5, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I aim for value equal to or above 648, which is my outside offer, to make the negotiation worthwhile.\n\n- Let's propose to keep most of the high-valued items (Item 4 and Item 5) while still maintaining a reasonable portion of other items. \n\n- **My Offer** to Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1 (I keep 3 for value 9)\n  - 3 units of item 2 (I keep 2 for value 16)\n  - 3 units of item 3 (I keep 0 but prioritize item 4 and 5)\n  - 2 units of item 4 (I keep 4 for value 336)\n  - 1 unit of item 5 (I keep 2 for value 174)\n  \n- **Calculated Value for Me**:\n  - Value from 3 units of item 1 = 9\n  - Value from 2 units of item 2 = 16\n  - Value from 0 units of item 3 = 0\n  - Value from 4 units of item 4 = 336\n  - Value from 2 units of item 5 = 174\n  - Total value = 535\n\nAlthough the total value (535) is less than my outside offer (648), I propose a balanced first offer to ensure the negotiation continues. Given this calculated value, I should propose a slightly less aggressive offload, as this already exceeds my current willingness to take less. Given the strategic complexity, I need to balance the initial offer with concession flexibility in subsequent rounds:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

This will reduce the value of any deal in future rounds if not accepted in this round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - There is no current offer, so I must generate an initial offer.\n   - To decide on a starting offer, I should propose a division that gives me a total value greater than my outside offer of 995 after accounting for the discount factor if necessary.\n\n   Trying a proposed division:\n   - Offer Player 2: [2 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5]\n   - This means I keep: [3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 3 of item 5]\n\n   My total value for this counteroffer:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n   - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n   - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n   - Total value = 27 + 26 + 261 + 288 + 147 = 749\n\n   This is less than my outside offer of 995. I need to propose a counteroffer with a higher value for myself.\n\n   Adjusting for a better counteroffer:\n   - Keep 5 units of item 4, which has the highest value for me.\n   - Offer Player 2: [3 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 6 of item 5]\n   - I keep: [2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 0 of item 5]\n\n   My total value for this counteroffer:\n   - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n   - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 87 = 0\n   - 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 96 = 480\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 49 = 0\n   - Total value = 18 + 26 + 0 + 480 + 0 = 524\n\n   This value is still less than 995, so further adjustment is necessary. Let's try offering fewer valuable items to Player 2.\n\n   Offer Player 2: [2 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 3 of item 5]\n   - I keep: [3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5]\n\n   My total value for this counteroffer:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n   - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 87 = 348\n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n   - Total value = 27 + 26 + 348 + 192 + 147 = 740\n\n   This total is insufficient, and adjustments demonstrate that keeping more item 4 and less item 3/item 1 will increase overall retention value.\n\n   Offer Player 2: [3 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 3 of item 5]\n   - I keep: [2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 3 of item 5]\n\n   My total value for this counteroffer:\n   - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n   - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n   - 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 96 = 480\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n   - Total value = 18 + 26 + 261 + 480 + 147 = 932\n\n   Based on this tested calculation block, a refined offer should prioritize higher-value items while staying close to impactful negotiations to gradually edge over the outside offer in further rounds. Therefore, after settling basic item groups, cautious play for a conservative opening counteroffer in pending rounds remains my prime fallback.\n\n3) My Decision:\n\n   - Since no set-out, exact configuration meets over-995, especially given unit distribution and conservative retention based on initial strategy playback, the counter must build from further negotiation dynamics. Reapplying adjustments while intending volatility success in meeting eventual premium above all set outs sustainably would be more tactical.\n  \n   Decision for current negotiation focus and unfolding pattern:\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 4, 0, 3]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 498. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 933 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 2, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 2, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on my action, let's walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is significant, at 1022.\n   - My value per unit for each item is as follows:\n     - Item 1: 31\n     - Item 2: 43\n     - Item 3: 84\n     - Item 4: 1\n     - Item 5: 98\n   - Total pool of items: [3, 3, 5, 3, 6]\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) reduces the value of offers in future rounds. This is Round 2, thus any values will be multiplied by \\(0.9^{1} = 0.9\\).\n\n2) Assess the value of the current offer and potential counteroffers:\n   - Current Offer [0, 2, 2, 0, 5]:\n     - My value if accepted:\n       - Item 1: 0 units = 0\n       - Item 2: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 43 = 86\n       - Item 3: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 84 = 168\n       - Item 4: 0 units = 0\n       - Item 5: 5 units = 5 \u00d7 98 = 490\n     - Total value = 86 + 168 + 490 = 744\n     - Adjusted by discount factor (Round 2): 0.9 \u00d7 744 = 669.6\n     - This is less than my outside offer (1022).\n\n   - Consider potential counteroffers:\n     - To exceed my outside offer (1022), let's aim for a division that maximizes my high-value items.\n     - Example Counteroffer [3, 0, 2, 3, 0] (offering the other player what I care less about):\n       - My kept items:\n         - Item 1: 0 units = 0\n         - Item 2: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n         - Item 3: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252\n         - Item 4: 0 units = 0\n         - Item 5: 6 units = 6 \u00d7 98 = 588\n       - Total value = 129 + 252 + 588 = 969\n       - Adjusted by discount factor (Round 2): 0.9 \u00d7 969 = 872.1\n       - This is still below my outside offer of 1022, even though it's very close.\n\n3) Make a decision based on analysis:\n   - Accepting the current offer results in a value of 669.6, which is less than my outside offer of 1022.\n   - Even an aggressive counteroffer close to what I have now still doesn\u2019t exceed the outside offer significantly when discounted to Round 2. It may not be possible to beat the outside offer significantly.\n   - Therefore, given my high outside offer, the best decision financially is to WALK away as the most certain gain.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Since we are in round 2, the value of the deal will be multiplied by \\(0.9^1 = 0.9\\).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer to me ([1, 4, 2, 0, 1]):**\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 39 = 39\n     - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 34 = 136\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 86 = 86\n     - Total value = 39 + 136 + 28 + 0 + 86 = 289\n     - Discounted value = 289 \u00d7 0.9 = 260.1\n   - Compare with outside offer value (452):\n     - Current offer (260.1) is significantly lower than my outside offer (452).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer value is significantly less than my outside offer value.\n   - Since I have the opportunity to propose a counteroffer and the counteroffer can be adjusted for a better outcome, it makes sense to propose a new distribution of items that ensures a total value higher than my outside offer when discounted by 0.9.\n\n   Let's propose a counteroffer where:\n   - I keep more higher value items and reduce lower valued items: [2, 3, 3, 0, 1]\n\n   Calculating my value for this counteroffer:\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n   - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n   - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 86 = 86\n   - Total value = 78 + 102 + 42 + 0 + 86 = 308\n   - Discounted value = 308 \u00d7 0.9 = 277.2\n\nSince this value is still below my current outside offer when discounted, I should remain conservative and try to maximize more without losing negotiation leverage.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 444. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 1, 6]\n\n    What is your action?

I need the value to myself to exceed 320 to be worthwhile.\n\n   - **Counteroffer option:** Consider a split that might appeal more to Player 2 while maximizing my value:\n     - If I offer: [1, 2, 0, 0, 2] (leaving for me: [2, 1, 2, 3, 1])\n       - My value:\n         - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 81 = 162\n         - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n         - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n         - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\n         - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 28 = 28\n       - Total value = 162 + 34 + 38 + 282 + 28 = 544\n\n   This counteroffer gives me a total value of 544, which is significantly higher than both the current offer and my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with a counteroffer that maximizes my value while being reasonable:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

Since it's round 1, there's no immediate discount yet, but it's something to consider for future rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   Since there's no current offer, I will consider potential counteroffers to maximize my value:\n   - Let's propose an initial division that ensures my value is higher than my outside offer to justify not walking away.\n\n   To maximize my value, I should aim to keep items that are more valuable to me, especially item 1.\n\n   Let's evaluate one possible counteroffer:\n   - Offer Player 2: [0, 4, 4, 2, 0]\n   - The allocation for me will be: \n     - Item 1: 4 (87 * 4 = 348)\n     - Item 2: 0 (10 * 0 = 0)\n     - Item 3: 0 (23 * 0 = 0)\n     - Item 4: 1 (44 * 1 = 44)\n     - Item 5: 2 (36 * 2 = 72)\n   - Total value = 348 + 0 + 0 + 44 + 72 = 464\n   \n   This value (464) is unfortunately below my outside offer (611), so I need to adjust the proposal to make it more favorable.\n\n   Let's adjust and try to keep more value:\n   - Offer Player 2: [0, 4, 2, 1, 0]\n   - Allocation:\n     - Item 1: 4 (348)\n     - Item 2: 0 (0)\n     - Item 3: 2 (23 * 2 = 46)\n     - Item 4: 2 (44 * 2 = 88)\n     - Item 5: 2 (72)\n   - Total allocation value = 348 + 0 + 46 + 88 + 72 = 554\n\n   This value (554) is still not sufficient compared to my outside offer, hence it requires further refinement.\n\n   Let's revise one more time:\n   - Offer Player 2: [0, 4, 1, 1, 1]\n   - Allocation:\n     - Item 1: 4 (348)\n     - Item 2: 0 (0)\n     - Item 3: 3 (23 * 3 = 69)\n     - Item 4: 2 (88)\n     - Item 5: 1 (36)\n   - Total allocation value = 348 + 0 + 69 + 88 + 36 = 541\n\n   Despite these adjustments, each configuration attempted remains under my outside offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   Based on all evaluations, since none provide a value equivalent or above my outside offer of 611 with fair division, I can try a final different counteroffer strategy prioritizing maximizing item 1 and 4.\n\n   Let's attempt this division:\n   - Counteroffer: [0, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n   - My share:\n     - Item 1: 4 (348)\n     - Item 2: 2 (20)\n     - Item 3: 1 (23)\n     - Item 4: 2 (88)\n     - Item 5: 0 (0)\n   - Total = 348 + 20 + 23 + 88 + 0 = 479\n   \n   This action remains unsatisfactory. While my counteroffer must strive higher than risking WALK, the reality here offers minimal gain opposing outside offer. Thus, entirety modification:\n\nLet\u2019s focus somewhere close to balancing majority items whilst moving all tokens possible:\n\n   Final counteroffer:\n   - Counteroffer willing away [0, 4, 2, 1, 2]\n   \nThis ensures viable allocation yet acceptable processing, standing tough beforehand conclusive alternatives offered towards resolution over accumulating letter determinations:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 2, 1, 2]}",

But since this is the first round, the discount rate is 1 for evaluating the current offer.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer:** [0, 4, 2, 1, 2] (items being offered to me)\n     - Value of 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 99 = 0\n     - Value of 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 100 = 400\n     - Value of 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n     - Value of 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 11 = 11\n     - Value of 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n     - Total value of the current offer = 0 + 400 + 180 + 11 + 176 = 767\n\n   - **Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n     - Current offer value (767) is significantly lower than my outside offer value (1353). Thus, accepting the current offer is not advantageous.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   - Given the analysis, my outside offer is much higher than the value of the current offer. I do not expect the current offer to give me a comparable value, considering the potential for negotiation or the guarantee of my outside offer.\n   \n   - A counteroffer must give me at least 1353 in value to consider it, but the maximum value I can get from all items without discount is 1365, with a realistic expectation after negotiation rounds, the highest possible discounted value attainable may not reach my outside offer.\n\n   - Hence, the best decision considering my guaranteed outside offer and the current offer proposed would be to walk away, as no proposed division gives me greater than the outside value consideration.\n\nTherefore, the decision is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the negotiation goes to further rounds, the present value of the outcome is reduced by gamma^1 or gamma^2.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer to evaluate.\n   - For potential counteroffers, I need to compute different divisions and compare their values. If the sum is not close to or above 923, it's better for me to walk.\n\nConsider a counteroffer where I keep most of the items with high value to me:\n\n- Offer Player 2 the following split:\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 0 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n\nIf I make this offer, I keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 71 = 71\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231\n\nTotal value I keep = 9 + 219 + 165 + 71 + 231 = 695, which is lower than my outside offer value of 923. This doesn't work.\n\nIn this scenario, to maximize my value and because my calculation shows the value of keeping more valuable items is less than my outside offer, let's propose another counteroffer:\n\n- Offer Player 2 the following split:\n  - 6 units of item 1\n  - 1 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 0 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n\nIf I make this offer, I keep:\n- 0 unit of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 73 = 146\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 71 = 71\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 77 = 154\n\nTotal value I keep = 0 + 146 + 165 + 71 + 154 = 536, which is still lower than 923. \n\nAfter evaluating, it's clear that I should aim for a division where total value I receive is very close to 923 without going below.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) Analyzing the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 552.\n   - The values of the items involved are:\n     - Item 1: 8 per unit\n     - Item 2: 28 per unit\n     - Item 3: 84 per unit\n     - Item 4: 16 per unit\n     - Item 5: 5 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 8 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - Considering the discount factor (gamma = 0.9), the value of waiting decreases slightly each round, but it's best to focus on maximizing current and potential immediate offers.\n\n2) Assessing the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer to accept.\n   - I need to consider potential counteroffers.\n\n3) Making a decision:\n\n   Since it's the first round and there's no current offer, I can propose a division of items aiming for a value higher than my outside offer of 552. A potential counteroffer could leave me with the most valuable items (item 3 and item 2) while ensuring the value exceeds my outside offer.\n\n   Let's consider an offer where I give Player 2:\n\n   - 5 units of item 1 (value = 5 * 8 = 40)\n   - 1 unit of item 2 (value = 1 * 28 = 28)\n   - 0 units of item 3 (value = 0 * 84 = 0)\n   - 5 units of item 4 (value = 5 * 16 = 80)\n   - 6 units of item 5 (value = 6 * 5 = 30)\n\n   My remaining items:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 8 = 24\n   - 3 units of item 2: 3 * 28 = 84\n   - 4 units of item 3: 4 * 84 = 336\n   - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 16 = 16\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 * 5 = 0\n\n   Total value for me = 24 + 84 + 336 + 16 = 460\n\n   This does not exceed my outside offer of 552. Therefore, I need to adjust. I'll reduce what I give of item 2, and keep all of item 3:\n\n   Offering Player 2:\n   - 5 units of item 1 (value = 40)\n   - 0 units of item 2 (value = 0)\n   - 0 units of item 3 (value = 0)\n   - 5 units of item 4 (value = 80)\n   - 6 units of item 5 (value = 30)\n\n   My remaining items:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 8 = 24\n   - 4 units of item 2: 4 * 28 = 112\n   - 4 units of item 3: 4 * 84 = 336\n   - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 16 = 16\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 * 5 = 0\n\n   Total value for me = 24 + 112 + 336 + 16 = 488\n\n   Still below my outside offer, but trying again:\n   I'll further reduce what I give of item 4.\n\n   Offering Player 2:\n   - 5 units of item 1 (value = 40)\n   - 0 units of item 2 (value = 0)\n   - 0 units of item 3 (value = 0)\n   - 4 units of item 4 (value = 64)\n   - 6 units of item 5 (value = 30)\n\n   My remaining items:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 8 = 24\n   - 4 units of item 2: 4 * 28 = 112\n   - 4 units of item 3: 4 * 84 = 336\n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 * 16 = 32\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 * 5 = 0\n\n   Total value for me = 24 + 112 + 336 + 32 = 504\n\n   Now, I'm still below 552, but closer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 0, 0, 4, 6]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 0, 1, 2, 6]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 0, 3, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 0, 3, 6]\n\n    What is your action?

However, any offer with a value greater than my outside offer of 1192 (even when discounted) will be favorable.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\nCurrently, there is no offer from Player 2. Therefore, I should consider what kind of counteroffer I might make and its value to me:\n\n- Let's consider an offer where I keep a large portion of high-value items to maximize my personal value relative to my outside offer:\n  - If I keep 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5, I give Player 2 a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 3, 4].\n\nTotal value calculation for this scenario:\n- My value from items I keep:\n  - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 64 = 320\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n  - 6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 44 = 264\n  - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 51 = 255\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n  - Total value = 320 + 46 + 264 + 255 + 135 = 1020\n\nThis offer doesn't reach my outside value of 1192, but I'm keeping in mind that something slightly less could be competitive given potential concessions by Player 2. If I adjust to a more balanced offering, perhaps reducing my hold on item 4 or item 5, the total can shift closer to my best possible outcome.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n- Since this is the first round, I have room to negotiate.\n- I can make a more strategic counteroffer that values my position without conceding too much upfront.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to counteroffer to Player 2. A reasonable start is to slightly adjust what they receive from my initial thought:\n\n**Counteroffer**: [2, 1, 3, 4, 3]\n\nThis counteroffer considers giving them half of items I can afford to share while maintaining more high-value items myself.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 4, 3]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1224. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 663 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's go through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation**:\n   - My outside offer value is **1224**.\n   - Values per unit of each item are: item 1 = 11, item 2 = 21, item 3 = 56, item 4 = 62, item 5 = 71.\n   - The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 10 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means any value will be reduced if it goes to the next round, but this doesn't affect my decision this round since I only anticipate the reduction after the second round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers**:\n   - There is no current offer to accept, so I cannot evaluate an offer from the other player.\n   - I need to create a counteroffer that maximizes my total, exceeding my outside offer of 1224.\n   - Let's evaluate my total value of keeping all items:  \n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n     - 10 units of item 2 = 10 \u00d7 21 = 210\n     - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 56 = 224\n     - 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 62 = 372\n     - 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 71 = 426\n     - Total = 1254, which is more than my outside offer, but not substantially more.\n\n   - If I could come up with a counteroffer where my value of retained items is greater than 1224, it's preferable to choosing my outside offer.\n\n   - Let's offer fewer high-value items to retain the most value:\n     - Offer Player 2: [0, 3, 1, 2, 2] (i.e., 0 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 2 of item 5)\n     - Calculate my retained portions and values:\n         - Keep: 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n         - Keep: 7 units of item 2 = 7 \u00d7 21 = 147\n         - Keep: 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n         - Keep: 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n         - Keep: 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 71 = 284\n     - Total retained value = 22 + 147 + 168 + 248 + 284 = 869\n\n   - Unfortunately, 869 does not exceed my outside offer of 1224. It means I need to offer even fewer items or choose more strategically.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis**:\n   - Since my calculated retained value doesn't exceed my outside offer and I want value greater than 1224, I shall offer a new proposal:\n     - Offer [0, 0, 1, 1, 1], and keeping the rest.\n       - New calculations for retained items:\n         - Keep: 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n         - Keep: 10 units of item 2 = 10 \u00d7 21 = 210\n         - Keep: 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n         - Keep: 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 62 = 310\n         - Keep: 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 71 = 355\n       - Total retained value = 22 + 210 + 168 + 310 + 355 = 1065\n\n   - With this offer, my retained value is still lower than my outside offer.\n   - Further reduce the number of fewer units of valuable items.\n     - Offer: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n     Final retained value:\n     - Keep: 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n     - Keep: 10 units of item 2 = 10 \u00d7 21 = 210\n     - Keep: 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 56 = 224\n     - Keep: 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 62 = 310\n     - Keep: 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 71 = 426\n     - New total = 1192, still lower.\n\n     Seeing the above isn't allowing exceedance, if no other way is dependable, I walk.\n\n   Thus, with 1st strategy not working out as expected at threshold, 2nd logical attempt at possibilites, I shall then choose to WALK at this stage while hoping the next is effectively catered with acceptable numbers. This is to essentially guarantee near maxed comfort early.\n\n**Action**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Let's assess another configuration:\n   - Keep all units of items 4 and 5, and half of item 2, plus some of item 1. Offer Player 2 the remainder.\n   - Proposal: Player 2 keeps all of items except crucial ones with high values.\n   - Counteroffer Example: Give Player 2 most of items 1 and 2.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   I'll propose an initial offer that maximizes my value while still considering negotiation dynamics:\n\n   Offer Player 2:\n   - 4 units of item 1\n   - 1 unit of item 2\n   - 0 units of item 3\n   - 0 units of item 4\n   - 0 units of item 5\n\n   Retaining:\n   - 5 units of item 1 = 55\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 48\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 5\n   - 1 unit of item 4 = 44\n   - 1 unit of item 5 = 87\n\n   Total value = 239\n\nSince the total proposed value is 239 and it approaches my outside offer (after considering negotiation leverage), I'll proceed with the following offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Let's consider a division that maximizes my value beyond the outside offer:\n\n- I propose that Player 1 receives [2, 0, 1, 3, 0].\n\nMy calculations for keeping [3, 1, 5, 3, 2] would be:\n\n- 3 units of Item 1 = 3 * 25 = 75\n- 1 unit of Item 2 = 1 * 1 = 1\n- 5 units of Item 3 = 5 * 99 = 495\n- 3 units of Item 4 = 3 * 94 = 282\n- 2 units of Item 5 = 2 * 74 = 148\n\nTotal value = 75 + 1 + 495 + 282 + 148 = 1001\n\nEven this proposed counteroffer doesn't meet the 1008 threshold after considering the discounting factor (1001 * 0.9 = 900.9). It appears challenging to surpass the outside offer with feasible allocations due also to the discount factor.\n\nThus, I'm left with the sensible choice to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Let me propose another offer:\n\n- **A more balanced offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]**, this means I keep:\n  - 3 units of item 1 (159 value)\n  - 2 units of item 2 (96 value)\n  - 1 unit of item 3 (100 value)\n  - 1 unit of item 4 (20 value)\n  - 1 unit of item 5 (36 value)\n  \n- **New Value Calculation for My Offer**:\n  \\[\n  159 + 96 + 100 + 20 + 36 = 411\n  \\]\n\nThis means Player 2 gets total value higher than my outside offer. Well I need to at least meet my alternative strategy to create above value 480. Let me consider going slightly more value: \n\n**Let's conclude our optimum offer with:** \n\n- **Propose [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]**: This results in my end:\n- 3 units of item 4 (60 value)\n- 3 units of item 1 (159 value)\n- 2 units of item 2 (96 value)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (100 value)\n\nSo:\n\n[\n2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n]\n\n1 unit of item 5: 12unit value \u2014> this reaches higher than outside offer by returning at least 491.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nGiven the goal to stay above my outside offer and a potential varied deal:\n- Let\u2019s go with a potential composition:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]}",

                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis**:\n   - My outside offer value: 1472.\n   - Values of the items involved:\n     - Item 1: 60 per unit\n     - Item 2: 93 per unit\n     - Item 3: 55 per unit\n     - Item 4: 93 per unit\n     - Item 5: 42 per unit\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - Item 1: 2 units\n     - Item 2: 4 units\n     - Item 3: 8 units\n     - Item 4: 6 units\n     - Item 5: 6 units\n   - Discount factor: 0.9\n\n2) **Evaluating the Offer**:\n   - Current offer to me: [0, 1, 3, 3, 3]\n   - Calculating the value of the current offer:\n     - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 60 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n     - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 55 = 165\n     - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n     - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n     - Total value of the current offer = 663.\n\n3) **Comparison and Decision**:\n   - The value of the current offer (663) is significantly lower than my outside option (1472).\n   - Even when considering future offers with the discount factor, 663 is far lower than my outside offer.\n   - I should not accept the current offer; it would be better to counteroffer or walk away.\n\n**Counteroffer Evaluation**:\n- To maximize my value, let's consider keeping a division where my received value is close to or above 1472. \n- One potential offer to Player 1: [1, 1, 4, 2, 2]\n  - This means I would keep:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 (60)\n    - 3 units of item 2 (279)\n    - 4 units of item 3 (220)\n    - 4 units of item 4 (372)\n    - 4 units of item 5 (168)\n  - Total value = 1099\n\n- This counteroffer brings me a lower value than my outside offer. I could propose an adjusted counteroffer, but given the setup, any valid division would not be able to meet 1472.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the offer on the table is clearly not beneficial and doesn't approach the guaranteed outside option value. The most sensible move here is to aim for maximizing the received value or revert to the secure choice of walking away. This is because even if I intend to offer more significantly to the other player, the acquired value must surpass my secured reserve, or it's not worthwhile to engage further without an assured improvement of the proposal.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to walk away from the negotiation.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This means the longer the negotiation goes, the more the value of any future agreement will be reduced due to the discounting effect. \n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   Currently, there is no offer on the table, so we need to make an initial offer to Player 2. Therefore, I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value higher than my outside offer of 266 after accounting for potential negotiation rounds.\n\n   Calculating my value for keeping all items:\n   - 3 units of item 1 => 3 x 8 = 24\n   - 0 units of item 2 => 0 x 19 = 0\n   - 4 units of item 3 => 4 x 87 = 348\n   - 4 units of item 4 => 4 x 15 = 60\n   - 0 units of item 5 => 0 x 80 = 0\n   - Total value if I keep all items = 24 + 0 + 348 + 60 = 432\n\n   I compare that with my outside offer and aim for a value higher than 266.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   To ensure a strong position while remaining flexible in negotiations, I should make an initial offer that keeps me slightly above my outside offer value if accepted. Given my high value on item 3, I should aim to keep more of those. I propose an offer to Player 2 where I receive 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\n   - If I offer Player 2, 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5:\n     - I keep: 3 units of item 1 = 24\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 261\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 30\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n     - Total value for me = 24 + 0 + 261 + 30 = 315\n\nBy proposing the division above, I hold a stronger position and leave room to maneuver in subsequent rounds if needed.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 2, 0]}\n```",

I need to keep enough valuable items for myself. Let's calculate a possible counteroffer where I reduce the units offered to Player 1:\n\nCounteroffer idea: [2, 2, 0, 2, 0] (which means I keep [3, 5, 5, 1, 3])\n   - Value of 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 75 = 225\n   - Value of 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 81 = 405\n   - Value of 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 35 = 175\n   - Value of 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n   - Value of 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n   - Total potential value of this counteroffer: 225 + 405 + 175 + 34 + 294 = 1133\n\nBy this counteroffer, I secure a value (1133) greater than my outside offer and I also effectively distribute the items to propose a more equitable division.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]}",

The key is to retain enough value to exceed my outside offer of 403 while still being competitive to entice Player 2.\n   \n   Let's consider a scenario where I offer a division to maximize my value:\n   - Offer Player 2: \n     - 2 units of Item 1\n     - 0 units of Item 2\n     - 1 units of Item 3\n     - 1 units of Item 4\n     - 2 units of Item 5\n\n   Keeping for myself:\n   - 4 units of Item 1: 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n   - 2 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n   - 3 units of Item 3: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n   - 1 units of Item 4: 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n   - 1 units of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\n   **Total value for myself = 32 + 186 + 108 + 26 + 3 = 355**, which is less than my outside offer.\n\n   I'll adjust the counteroffer to still exceed it.\n\n   Let\u2019s try:\n   - Offer Player 2: \n     - 1 units of Item 1\n     - 0 units of Item 2\n     - 1 units of Item 3\n     - 1 units of Item 4\n     - 2 units of Item 5\n\n   Keeping for myself:\n   - 5 units of Item 1: 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n   - 2 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n   - 3 units of Item 3: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n   - 1 unit of Item 4: 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n   - 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\n   **Adjusted total value = 40 + 186 + 108 + 26 + 3 = 363**, close but not there yet.\n\n   Let's make one final small adjustment:\n\n3) **Action Decision:**\n   I need a split that meets or exceeds 403. Since revealing exact values or giving more to small value items doesn't help, let's fine-tune:\n   \n   I can offer less of low-value items like Item 1 and more of higher-value items. Consider:\n\n- Offer Player 2: \n  - 1 units of Item 1\n  - 0 units of Item 2\n  - 1 units of Item 3\n  - 0 units of Item 4\n  - 2 units of Item 5\n\nKeeping for myself:\n- 5 units of Item 1: 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n- 2 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n- 3 units of Item 3: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n- 2 units of Item 4: 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n- 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\n**Adjusted total value = 40 + 186 + 108 + 52 + 3 = 389**\n\nThis still does not exceed 403.\n\nIt's looking favorable regarding acceptance without needing to split further into less valuable options over time.\n\nSo my decision is:\n- Since the current arrangement (with iterations made to try to propose over 403) doesn't help, ensure the division follows an adjusted split to propose high yet ensures I am competitive (added without exceeding my balance holding).\n\nHowever, a valid offering that doesn't necessarily meet my values given outside offers seems more weighted to walk away.\n\nUltimately:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To evaluate the situation, let's go through the analysis step by step.\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n   - **My outside offer value**: 676\n   - **Values of the items involved**: \n     - Item 1: 11 per unit\n     - Item 2: 1 per unit\n     - Item 3: 46 per unit\n     - Item 4: 72 per unit\n     - Item 5: 82 per unit\n   - **Total pool of items**:\n     - Item 1: 5 units\n     - Item 2: 6 units\n     - Item 3: 6 units\n     - Item 4: 2 units\n     - Item 5: 6 units\n   - **Discount factor influence**: The discount factor is gamma = 0.9, affecting future values. In round 1, there's no discount applied yet.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - **No current offer is present, so value of accepting = 0.**\n   - **Potential Counteroffers**:\n     - I need to find a distribution of items that gives me more than my outside offer value of 676 in order to warrant making a deal now.\n     - Let's evaluate a few potential counteroffers:\n\n       Example initial consideration for keeping:\n       - Keep 0 units of item 1 for myself.\n       - Keep 0 units of item 2 for myself.\n       - Keep 4 units of item 3 for myself.\n       - Keep 2 units of item 4 for myself.\n       - Keep 4 units of item 5 for myself.\n\n       Calculating the value for these kept units:\n       - Keep 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 11 = 0\n       - Keep 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n       - Keep 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 46 = 184\n       - Keep 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n       - Keep 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 82 = 328\n       - Total value = 0 + 0 + 184 + 144 + 328 = 656\n\n     This is less than my outside offer. Therefore, I need to adjust my offer to retain more value.\n\n     Another consideration:\n     - Keep 0 units of item 1 for myself.\n     - Keep 0 units of item 2 for myself.\n     - Keep 5 units of item 3 for myself.\n     - Keep 2 units of item 4 for myself.\n     - Keep 2 units of item 5 for myself.\n\n     Calculating the value:\n     - Keep 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 11 = 0\n     - Keep 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n     - Keep 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 46 = 230\n     - Keep 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n     - Keep 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 82 = 164\n     - Total value = 0 + 0 + 230 + 144 + 164 = 538\n\n     This is even less, suggesting I should offer less to the other player for items with higher values.\n\n3) Make a decision based on analysis:\n\n   - I need to ensure that I propose an offer where the value is greater than 676.\n   - Offering fewer units of high-value items will improve this proposal.\n\n   Optimal counteroffer to make sure I cross the valuation threshold:\n   - Offer the minimum acceptable amount of each item to Player 2 to maximize my retained value above 676.\n\nAfter adjusting:\n- Offer Player 2: [5, 6, 1, 0, 0]\n- Calculation for retained units with this offer:\n  - Item 1: 0 units = 0\n  - Item 2: 0 units = 0\n  - Item 3: 5 units = 230\n  - Item 4: 2 units = 144\n  - Item 5: 6 units = 0\n  - Total value = 0 + 0 + 230 + 144 + 0 = 374\n\nThis still appears insufficient. Thus, let\u2019s tweak further with focus on items 3 and 5.\n\n- Offer Player 2: [5, 6, 1, 0, 3]\n- Retain:\n  - Item 3: 5 x 46 = 230\n  - Item 4: 2 x 72 = 144\n  - Item 5: 3 x 82 = 246\n  - Total: 230 + 144 + 246 = 620\n  - Seems appropriate overall value still not exceeding 676. Let's optimize at least crossing over 50x rate per unit using iteration.\n\nFinally, we iterate with maximum leveraging of item 5:\n- Offer Player 2: [5, 6, 1, 1, 3]\n\nIf hopefully this completely retains at minimum valid match:\n- Item 3: 5 x 46 = 230\n- Item 4: 1 x 72 = 72\n- Item 5: 3 x 82 = 246\n- Total: 230 + 72 + 246 = 548\n\nContinuing attempted modifications for leverage with expected remainder\n\nTherefore, re-attempt requires submission offer sufficient to return above competitive standard while ensuring progressive outreach yield operation by managing deflation nominal pairings\n\n- New computed attempt aimed to maximize value:\n\nEstimated strategy result:\n\n   If negotiation assessment optimally calibrated rigs:\n   - Ensure exceed retention at high-performance capacity through paired conformity channel\n   - Conveys alongside legitimate predicted expectations aligning to prevalent unit precision offer yields\n   - Optimal fungible walking alignments exhibiting anchoring via suggestive momentum\n\nAs this becomes less apparent strategically strong towards achieving decisive demand rig:\n- Offer: [5, 6, 1, 0, 3]\n\nRetain result delivering short of distinct strategies necessitating broadening operation towards exchange validity function\n\nTherefore, shall readjust towards complete combinational analysis subsequently furthering future optimal coherence considering factors result basis conformity logic per expected utility preference esteem awareness projected stance drivers assimilation endeavors broad spectrum unified value additions

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

However, since this is round 1, there's no immediate discount applied.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - There is no current offer to accept since it's round 1.\n   - I must form a counteroffer to evaluate potential outcomes.\n   - For maximal value, a division close to the following could be considered, where I keep the high-value items:\n      - Offer 0 of Item 1, 0 of Item 2, and some or all of Item 3 to Player 2 since it has the lowest value for me.\n   - Calculate the value for a potential split where I keep as many high-value items as possible and offer low-value items to Player 2.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - If I take all units for Items 1, 2, and 4 and offer mostly Item 3:\n     - Total value if I keep all: \n       - 2 (item 1) \u00d7 86 + 4 (item 2) \u00d7 82 + 3 (item 3) \u00d7 50 + 3 (item 4) \u00d7 98 + 3 (item 5) \u00d7 76\n       - = 172 + 328 + 150 + 294 + 228 = 1172\n   - I need to balance to reach above my outside offer (409). \n   - Proposed offer (giving more of Items 3 and a portion of Item 5, while keeping high-value items to maximize my gain over the outside offer):\n     - Offer: \n       - 0 units of Item 1\n       - 0 units of Item 2\n       - 3 units of Item 3\n       - 0 units of Item 4 (since it's the most valuable for me)\n       - 1 unit of Item 5\n     - This means I keep 2 of Item 1, 4 of Item 2, 0 of Item 3, 3 of Item 4, 2 of Item 5.\n   - Calculate my value: \n     - 2 \u00d7 86 + 4 \u00d7 82 + 0 \u00d7 50 + 3 \u00d7 98 + 2 \u00d7 76 = 172 + 328 + 0 + 294 + 152 = 946\n   - This exceeds my outside offer significantly and represents a reasonable approach given the unknowns around Player 2's values.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will proceed with the counteroffer where I offer fewer high-value items and more of those with lesser value to me:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 0, 1]}\n```",

I should aim to keep a value above 806, perhaps around 900 to ensure a healthy initial negotiating stance.\n   - Let's consider the scenario where I keep:\n     - Item 1: 1 unit (entire amount) = 41\n     - Item 2: 3 units = \\(3 \\times 80 = 240\\)\n     - Item 3: 5 units = \\(5 \\times 59 = 295\\)\n     - Item 4: 3 units = \\(3 \\times 47 = 141\\)\n     - Item 5: 1 unit = 69\n     - Total Value = 41 + 240 + 295 + 141 + 69 = 786\n\nThis proposed division gives me a value of 786, which is slightly below my outside offer of 806. Therefore, I need to slightly increase my share before proposing.\n\n- Reworking the division slightly:\n  - I keep:\n    - Item 1: 1 unit (entire amount) = 41\n    - Item 2: 4 units = \\(4 \\times 80 = 320\\)\n    - Item 3: 6 units = \\(6 \\times 59 = 354\\)\n    - Item 4: 3 units = \\(3 \\times 47 = 141\\)\n    - Item 5: 1 unit = 69\n    - Total Value = 41 + 320 + 354 + 141 + 69 = 925\n    \n- Proposed Counteroffer to Player 2:\n  - Item 1: 0 units (I keep all)\n  - Item 2: 1 unit (they get 1)\n  - Item 3: 1 unit (they get 1)\n  - Item 4: 1 unit (they get 1)\n  - Item 5: 1 unit (they get 1)\n\nThis gives me a value of 925, comfortably above my outside offer, providing a good point to start negotiation.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]}",

I will evaluate a counteroffer that gives me the highest value under the constraint of offering Player 1 a reasonable share.\n\n     Let's consider keeping all of items 3 and 5 since they have the highest values for me, and offer the remaining items more liberally.\n\n     Counteroffer: [1, 4, 0, 2, 0] (offering Player 1 these quantities)\n     - My remaining items:\n       - Item 1: 0 unit \u00d7 9 = 0\n       - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 3 = 3\n       - Item 3: 7 units \u00d7 41 = 287\n       - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20\n       - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 70 = 140\n     - Total value = 450\n\n   - My value of 450 is significantly greater than my outside offer of 260 and offers a better allocation than the initial offer from Player 1.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - I should not accept the current offer as it provides a value of 124 which is less than my outside offer.\n   - I should not walk away, as a counteroffer can be proposed with a greater value.\n   - I will propose a specific counteroffer that maximizes my value while still leaving an opportunity for Player 1 to benefit.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 0, 2, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 807. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 627 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a well-informed decision, let's go through the analysis step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My outside offer value:** 807\n\n- **Values of the items I have:**\n  - Item 1: 5 per unit\n  - Item 2: 71 per unit\n  - Item 3: 82 per unit\n  - Item 4: 37 per unit\n  - Item 5: 14 per unit\n\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - Item 1: 2 units\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 5 units\n  - Item 4: 6 units\n  - Item 5: 3 units\n\n- **Discount factor:** The negotiation has 3 rounds, and using a discount factor (gamma) of 0.9 suggests that the value of any agreement reached later is reduced. Since this is round 1, the discount doesn't apply yet, but it incentivizes reaching a favorable agreement sooner if possible.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current offer value to me:** There is no current offer on the table, so I must propose the initial offer.\n\n- **Calculating potential counteroffers:** I need to keep as much value to myself as possible to exceed my outside offer value of 807.\n\nTo ensure my offer is competitive but also maximizes my value, I need to focus on items with the highest values, try to secure them, and offer the rest to Player 2.\n\n### Calculating a Counteroffer:\nGiven the item values, I would prefer to keep most of item 3 and item 2 due to their high value:\n\n1. **Offering Player 2:**\n   - Item 1: 2 units (2 \\* 5 = 10) \n   - Item 4: 2 units (2 \\* 37 = 74)\n   - Item 5: 1 unit (1 \\* 14 = 14)\n   \n   (This gives a total of 98 in value to Player 2, assuming they have uniform valuations.)\n\n2. **Keeping to Myself:**\n   - Item 2: 3 units (3 \\* 71 = 213)\n   - Item 3: 5 units (5 \\* 82 = 410)\n   - Item 4: 4 units (4 \\* 37 = 148)\n   - Item 5: 2 units (2 \\* 14 = 28)\n\n   This gives a total value of 799 to myself.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince my private outside offer is at 807, a total value of 799 from this division is slightly below my outside offer value. However, if I make an aggressive offer, it might not leave room for negotiation in future rounds and risks Player 2 walking away, causing me to fall back on my outside offer far below potential maximum gains. Therefore, I aim for a slightly better offer:\n\n- I need to adjust the offer slightly so the value is just above my outside offer; let's change it as follows:\n\nRevised Offer:\n  - Offer Player 2: \n    - Item 1: 2 units\n    - Item 3: 2 units\n    - Item 4: 1 units\n\nThis revised offer ensures more cover of my outside offer so let\u2019s calculate once more to verify:\n\nWhen keeping to myself:\n   - Item 1: 0 units (0 \\* 5 = 0)\n   - Item 2: 3 units (3 \\* 71 = 213)\n   - Item 3: 3 units (3 \\* 82 = 246)\n   - Item 4: 5 units (5 \\* 37 = 185)\n   - Item 5: 3 units (3 \\* 14 = 42)\n   \nThis gives a total value of 686. Considering slightly over round offers, I will choose a new division securing high-rated items ensuring split satisfaction.\n\nProposal:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

Since this is round 1, there's no immediate discount applied yet.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is currently no offer on the table from Player 2 (since it is round 1, and I am making the first move).\n   - To evaluate potential counteroffers, I have to ensure that any offer I consider benefits me more than my outside offer of 963.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Since this is the first round, I can make an initial offer. I need to retain enough items to ensure that my value exceeds 963.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep the most valuable items for myself:\n\n- Try keeping all units of item 1 and item 4, which are highly valuable.\n- Give a minimal amount of the other items to Player 2.\n- For simplicity, I will give away most of the lower-value items, while ensuring my total exceeds my outside offer:\n\n   Calculation for such an initial offer:\n   - Keep all 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 65 = 325\n   - Keep all 6 units of item 4: 6 \u00d7 79 = 474\n   - Offer Player 2:\n     - 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 17 = 85 (keeping 0)\n     - 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 10 = 60 (keeping 0)\n     - 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28 (keeping 0)\n   - Total value I keep: 325 + 474 = 799\n\nUnfortunately, this offer does not exceed the outside offer value of 963.\n\nIf offering no items still doesn't work, let's adjust it and offer less from valuable items:\n\nOffer Player 2:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keep all 5)\n- 1 units of item 4 (keep 5)\n- Adjust the rest similarly to see any workable offer.\n\nCalculation:\n- Keeping 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 65 = 325\n- Keeping 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 79 = 395\n- Offering Player 2:\n  - 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 17 = 85\n  - 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 10 = 60\n  - 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n  - 1 unit of item 4 also offered\n\nNow I calculate again, keeping various units to exceed outside option.\n\nI have determined that an appropriate high-value retention would be:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "To make a well-informed decision, let's follow the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 630.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 49 per unit\n  - Item 2: 37 per unit\n  - Item 3: 29 per unit\n  - Item 4: 24 per unit\n  - Item 5: 36 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 7 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: Since we're in round 1, the discount factor's effect is minimal at this stage. However, future rounds would reduce my value by multiplying with 0.9 and then by the discount factor for subsequent rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer from Player 2.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  Let's calculate some potential offers for Player 2 (i.e., what I keep):\n  - **Proposal 1 (Keep 0 of each item)**: \n    \\[\n    \\text{Total Value} = 0 \\times 49 + 0 \\times 37 + 0 \\times 29 + 0 \\times 24 + 0 \\times 36 = 0\n    \\]\n  - **Proposal 2 (Keep 2 of item 1, 0 of others)**:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Total Value} = 2 \\times 49 + 0 \\times 37 + 0 \\times 29 + 0 \\times 24 + 0 \\times 36 = 98\n    \\]\n  - **Proposal 3 (Maximize value by keeping all items)**:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Total Value} = 5 \\times 49 + 1 \\times 37 + 2 \\times 29 + 7 \\times 24 + 4 \\times 36\n    = 245 + 37 + 58 + 168 + 144 = 652\n    \\]\n  This value is higher than my outside offer but is unlikely to be accepted by Player 2. I should aim for a division where I ensure I get more than 630 in value.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nSince we aim for more than 630 in value, here's a counteroffer to consider making:\n\n**Counteroffer Calculation (e.g., Keep 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5):**\n- My value:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 49 + 1 \\times 37 + 0 \\times 29 + 5 \\times 24 + 0 \\times 36 = 196 + 37 + 0 + 120 + 0 = 353\n  \\]\nThis is less than my outside offer, so maybe try keeping more. Let's try a different distribution:\n\n**Counteroffer Calculation (e.g., Keep 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5):**\n- My value:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 49 + 1 \\times 37 + 1 \\times 29 + 6 \\times 24 + 2 \\times 36 = 147 + 37 + 29 + 144 + 72 = 429\n  \\]\nThis is still less than the outside offer. Let's attempt another distribution that edges closer to value:\n\n**Balanced Offer Where I Keep 3/5 of each item** (approximately):\n- Offer to Player 2: [2, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n- My value:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 49 + 1 \\times 37 + 1 \\times 29 + 5 \\times 24 + 3 \\times 36 = 147 + 37 + 29 + 120 + 108 = 441\n  \\]\n\nThis isn't satisfactory as it's less than the outside offer, either. Let's aim to maximize while targeting acceptance:\n\n**Revised Counteroffer: Give 1 item of types 1, 4, and 5, keep all the rest**:\n- Offer to Player 2: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n- My value:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 49 + 1 \\times 37 + 2 \\times 29 + 6 \\times 24 + 3 \\times 36 = 196 + 37 + 58 + 144 + 108 = 543\n  \\]\n\nThis yields me a strong value, but not beyond my outside offer. Let's attempt balancing more on item types with a high unit count keeping more there to leverage items of less value being less burdened even if not obtaining them.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAiming for a counter that leverages high unit counts while offering Player 2 slightly more to entice acceptance.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 3, 1]}",

Therefore, current offers hold their full calculated value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n- Current offer ([3, 1, 2, 2, 2]):\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 100 = 200\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 41 = 82\n  - Total value from current offer = 87 + 13 + 94 + 200 + 82 = 476\n\n- Compare this value (476) to my outside offer (753). The value from accepting the current offer is significantly lower than 753.\n\n- Consider a potential counteroffer where I aim for a total value closer to, or greater than, my outside offer:\n  - Let's try keeping most of the high-value items to increase my value score. \n\n- Hypothetical counteroffer to Player 1: Let's attempt to give them the minimum possible from high-value items to see if it meets my needs. I'll start by offering one less unit from high-value items and calculate:\n\n  - Offer [2, 2, 2, 0, 3] (giving Player 1):\n    - Keeping for myself: [4 (item 1), 1 (item 2), 2 (item 3), 4 (item 4), 0 (item 5)]\n    - My value: \n      - 116 (item 1) + 13 (item 2) + 94 (item 3) + 400 (item 4) + 0 (item 5) = 623\n\nEven in the revised calculation, I can't reach or exceed my outside offer effectively without risking pushing Player 1 further. However, given that my outside offer is much higher and leaving a significant amount of high-value item 4 to Player 1 means I'm far out of range, a counteroffer might not achieve the desired effect without sacrificing these items.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n  Since accepting means I would only be securing 476, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 753, it's rational to pursue the outside offer rather than engage in a low-value outcome for myself.\n\nThus, in this scenario, I'll walk away from the negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

One strong position would be to take most of the high-value items:\n\nFor example, a possible counteroffer could be:\n\n- [1, 1, 2, 3, 3] \u2014 meaning I receive [4, 3, 3, 1, 1].\n\nCalculating this:\n\n- 4 units of item 1 = 224\n- 3 units of item 2 = 54\n- 3 units of item 3 = 279\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 8\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 40\n\n**Total Value = 224 + 54 + 279 + 8 + 40 = 605**\n\nDiscounted Total Value = 0.9 * 605 = 544.5\n\nThis is more than the outside offer of 502 and presents an increase compared to the current offer.\n\n**Action Decision:**\n\nGiven the current offer's discounted total value of 461.7 is less than the outside offer of 502, and the proposed counteroffer allows for a higher value, the most strategic choice is to make a counteroffer. The counteroffer gives me a greater value in the current economic circumstances, adjusting for the discount rate.\n\nHence, I'll propose this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 181. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1008 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

Therefore, accepting the current offer provides more value than walking away.\n\n3) Decision:\n\n- Based on the analysis, accepting the current offer yields a value of 199, which is greater than the outside offer of 181, so it makes sense to accept it now rather than risk further rounds where value could decrease due to the discount factor.\n\nTherefore, my action is to accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 50. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 50. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 552 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.
