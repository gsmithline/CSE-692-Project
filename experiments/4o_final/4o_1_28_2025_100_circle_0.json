                    "response": "To decide on the best action for round 2, let's carefully analyze the current offer from Player 2 and assess our potential value in comparison to our outside offer.\n\n**Current Offer Analysis:**\n\nThe current offer from Player 2 is [1, 3, 0, 2, 3]. This means:\n- I receive: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n- Player 2 receives: 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n\n**Calculating My Value from the Current Offer:**\n\n1. Item 1: 2 units * 78 value/unit = 156\n2. Item 2: 2 units * 23 value/unit = 46\n3. Item 3: 2 units * 82 value/unit = 164\n4. Item 4: 4 units * 69 value/unit = 276\n5. Item 5: 3 units * 44 value/unit = 132\n\nTotal value if I accept the current offer = 156 + 46 + 164 + 276 + 132 = 774\n\n**Discounted Value Assessment:**\n\nThis deal value would be adjusted by the discount rate for round 2, which is gamma = 0.9:\n- Discounted value = 774 * 0.9 = 696.6\n\n**Compare Against Outside Offer:**\n\n- My outside offer = 56\n\nSince 696.6 (adjusted negotiation value) is significantly higher than my outside offer of 56, accepting this offer would give me a much better outcome than walking away. \n\nFurthermore, since we're now in round 2 and any counteroffer by Player 2 would be treated as a walk (should negotiation reach round 3), accepting what seems to be a beneficial agreement now maximizes the deal potential rather than risking a walk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the above analysis, the current offer provides a substantially higher value compared to my outside offer and is likely the best outcome I can secure without risking walking away with less favorable terms.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Items with higher value should be prioritized.\n\n### Forming an Initial Offer:\nGiven that rounds are limited, securing a deal with a higher valuation is critical. Thus, I'll formulate an offer to give some control over items 4 and 5 to Player 2 since they are my least valued items.\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - Item 1: 0 units\n  - Item 2: 1 unit\n  - Item 3: 0 units\n  - Item 4: 2 units\n  - Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThis allocation allows me to still keep higher value items primarily for myself, aimed at exceeding my outside offer adjusted for the discount factor. \n\nNow let's calculate the remaining value for myself:\n- Remaining for me:\n  - Item 1: 4 units = 340 value\n  - Item 2: 1 unit = 94 value\n  - Item 3: 2 units = 108 value\n  - Item 4: 3 units = 120 value\n  - Item 5: 1 unit = 10 value\n\nTotal Value for me = 340 + 94 + 108 + 120 + 10 = 672\n\n### Decision and Action:\nThis offer keeps my valuation significantly above my threshold, while leaving room for Player 2 to benefit and considering potential negotiation outcomes.

Since 518.4 is greater than 321, the current offer provides more value than walking away.\n\nHowever, I may consider making a counteroffer that is more favorable to me while still being acceptable for Player 2. To maximize my outcome, I can try providing a counteroffer that could potentially yield a higher value.\n\nA possible counteroffer that likely gives me higher value while possibly being acceptable to Player 2 could be:\n\n- I keep more units of high-value items while conceding low-value items, potentially offering them:\n  - [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\nThis offer leaves me with:\n\n- Item 1: 2 units\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 3 units\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\nMy new values with this counteroffer:\n\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 * 7 = 14\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 * 14 = 28\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 * 33 = 99\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 * 39 = 117\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 * 83 = 249\n\nTotal value = 507, and applying the discount factor for the next round will be less favorable due to reduced future value opportunity from fewer remaining valued units. However, for decision calculations here:\n\n\\[ \\text{Discounted value for me in next round} = 507 \\times 0.9^{2} = 410.67 \\]\n\nEven with future discounting factored above, I would prepare the counter here as follows in real conditions based on competitive perspectives overall. Thus, acceptance or precisely computing and reasoning more deeply on current stage contexts for round standings is challenging without further details (other conditions included for broad outcomes).\n\nGiven these realistic conditions:\n\nI will offer:\n\n\\[ \\text{Counter: } \\text{[1, 0, 1, 1, 2]} \\]\n\nThis aims to yield potential relative acceptance leaning decisions within flexible trade measures applied for negotiation interactions. Addressing broader bargaining prospects distinctly entails valuable consideration by remaining insightful, staunchly forward.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

I want to keep the items with the highest values per unit (items 3 and 5), since those are the most valuable to me.\n\nTherefore, I propose an initial offer to Player 2 by giving them the entire supply of items 1 and 4, which have lower values for me.

This means that the value I need to secure through negotiation should be more than 1184 to make it worthwhile to agree to a deal rather than take the outside offer.\n\n3. **Strategy**:  \n   Given that the total potential value for me in this deal is 1351 and my outside offer is 1184, I need an outcome that provides a value of at least 1184/1351 = 0.876 or more of the total item value. Considering the discount factor (gamma) of 0.9 (that only applies should I need to counter or wait further rounds), I should aim to get the maximum value in this round.\n\n4. **Initial Offer Consideration**:  \n   To maximize my retained value from the negotiation:\n   - I should focus on retaining items with the highest value to me.\n   - Item 3 has the highest unit value (99), followed by item 1 (97) and item 5 (81). Items 2 and 4 have relatively lower values.\n\n5. **Formulating the Offer**:  \n   - I can propose giving away all of items that have lower importance based on my value system and retain the high-value items for myself.\n   - Thus, I'll aim to secure items 1, 3, and 5 for myself primarily.\n\nTherefore, my initial offer to Player 2 would be: \n\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 3 units\n- Item 3: 0 units\n- Item 4: 3 units\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- All 4 units of Item 1\n- 3 units of Item 2\n- All 3 units of Item 3\n- 0 units of Item 4\n- 2 units of Item 5\n\nLet\u2019s calculate my value from this proposal:\n- Item 1: 4 * 97 = 388\n- Item 2: 3 * 63 = 189\n- Item 3: 3 * 99 = 297\n- Item 4: 0 * 15 = 0\n- Item 5: 2 * 81 = 162\n\nTotal value = 388 + 189 + 297 + 0 + 162 = 1036\n\nGiven my outside reservation offer of 1184, this proposal does not meet my minimum requirement. I need to adjust my offer to get more than 1184 worth in the first round.\n\nSo, I will revise my strategy, targeting the most valuable items and considering I am also aiming to maximize my value above the outside offer on initial offer round. To allow a better offer than my last suggestion:\n\nNew offer adjustment:\n- Item 1: 0 units (keep all 4)\n- Item 2: 4 units (give)\n- Item 3: 0 units (keep all 3)\n- Item 4: 3 units (give)\n- Item 5: 0 unit (keep all 3)\n\nRetained value:\n- Item 1: 4 * 97 = 388\n- Item 2: 2 * 63 = 126\n- Item 3: 3 * 99 = 297\n- Item 4: 0 * 15 = 0\n- Item 5: 3 * 81 = 243\n\nTotal retained value = 388 + 126 + 297 + 0 + 243 = 1053\n\nThis value after adjusting is still under my outside offer threshold, yet this counteroffer aims to still benefit in further rounds or accept further negotiation feedback.\n\nThe appropriate action would be:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 3, 0]}",

I'll aim for about 70% of the total value, calculated as:\n\n70% of 1135 = 794.5\n\nNow, I'll determine the offer for Player 2 that would maintain my value:\n\n1. I'll keep all of Item 4, as it's the highest value per unit at 77.\n2. I'll keep both units of Item 5, as it's the second highest value per unit at 85.\n3. I'll make a balanced allocation decision for Items 1, 2, and 3.\n\nPropose:\n- Offer Player 2 three units of Item 1 (thus, value to me remains 4)\n- Offer Player 2 two units of Item 2 (leave four to me, value remains 184)\n- Offer Player 2 two units of Item 3 (leave four to me, value remains 192)\n\nChecking the values I intend to keep:\n- Item 1: 1 unit * 4 value = 4\n- Item 2: 4 units * 46 value = 184\n- Item 3: 4 units * 48 value = 192\n- Item 4: 5 units * 77 value = 385\n- Item 5: 2 units * 85 value = 170\n\nValue to me: 935\n\nThis allocation provides me with a value higher than my aspirational target of 794.5 and significantly higher than my outside offer, while still leaving substantial value on the table for Player 2.

A reasonable approach is to create a counteroffer that attempts to improve my share so that my value is closer to or above my outside option.\n\n4. **Formulating a Counteroffer:**\n   - I want more of the items I value highly: items 1, 2, and 3.\n   - Let's revise the offer to improve my values:\n     - Take all units of item 1, as I value it high: 4\n     - Increase units of item 2 to 5\n     - Increase units of item 3 to 5\n     - Leave some items for player 1 to still be reasonable.\n\n   My counteroffer: [0, 1, 1, 5, 2]\n\nNow let's calculate the value of the counteroffer for me:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 * 58 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 61 = 61\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 60 = 60\n- 5 units of item 4: 5 * 54 = 270\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 * 36 = 72\n\nNew offer's value: 0 + 61 + 60 + 270 + 72 = 463\n\nThis value is still below 1196 but increases pressure on Player 1 to improve the offer or accept my terms, getting it closer to my outside option.

I need to make an initial offer considering my values of the items and assuming Player 2 will also value the negotiation more than their outside offer.\n- To maximize appeal to Player 2, I should offer items that are of relatively lower value to me, possibly of higher value to them, so that they might accept.\n\nLet's consider an initial offer:\n1. Aim to keep high-value items for myself or a significant portion thereof.\n2. Offer some units of items that might be of lower value to me relative to their perceived value.\n\n### Calculation\n- I value item 3 (94) and item 5 (51) highest. I should distribute them carefully.\n- I value item 1 (19) lowest, which might appeal to them if they value it higher.\n\n#### Tentative Initial Offer to Player 2:\n- Offer all 6 units of Item 1: Total value to me = 114\n- Offer 2 units of Item 3: Total value to me = 188\n- Offer 3 units of Item 2: Total value to me = 243\n\nSubtotal offered value = 114 + 188 + 243 = 545\n\nBy keeping:\n- 2 units of Item 2 (162), 2 units of Item 3 (188), all units of Item 4 (27), and all units of Item 5 (306), I retain value = 683\n\nThis offer leaves me slightly in deficit to my outside offer, but given dynamics of negotiation and the possibility of further negotiation, this is reasonable for an initial round to gauge Player 2's preferences.\n\nAccordingly, the initial offer for Player 2 will be:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 3, 2, 0, 0]}",

Since this is round 1, there are two potential rounds of negotiation after this, but if we assume the negotiation continues to round 3, the value would be subject to the discount factor:\n\nIf I go to round 3 and accept a similar value:  \n- Expected value if similar deal accepted in round 3 = 256 * 0.81 = 207.36\n\nClearly, this expected value is significantly lower than my outside offer (597), and even accepting it right now (256) is much lower than the outside offer.\n\nGiven these calculations, accepting the current offer doesn't make sense, as it's much lower than my outside offer. Thus, it would be beneficial to counteroffer to improve my value or, if not possible by the last round, consider walking.\n\n**Counteroffer Strategy:**\nCreate a counteroffer that attempts to increase the total value closer to or above my outside offer while ensuring it could be potentially acceptable to Player 1.

Now let\u2019s calculate the value I would keep for myself from this offer:\n\n\\[\n\\text{My Kept Value} = (65 \\times 4) + (57 \\times 2) + (16 \\times 1) + (74 \\times 4) + (2 \\times 5) = 260 + 114 + 16 + 296 + 10 = 696\n\\]\n\nThus, if Player 2 accepts this offer, I would get a value considerably higher than my outside offer.

I'll aim for an offer that gives me a higher portion of items with high personal value. Particularly, I value Items 2 and 4, so I'll try to secure more units of these.\n\nTo counteroffer, I will propose:\n- A split that still favors me in high-value items while distributing lower-value ones to Player 1.\n- I'll provide more of the items that are equal or less valuable to me but ensure I gain enough of Items 2 and 4 to exceed the value of my outside offer.\n\nBased on these insights, my counteroffer will be:\n- Item 1: 1 (since Player 1 offered me 1, I offer 1 back)\n- Item 2: 0 (I want all 3 to maximize my value in the next round, assuming they're valuable to both)\n- Item 3: 0 (not available)\n- Item 4: 1 (I secure 3 to increase my value significantly)\n- Item 5: 2 (sharing more, slightly reduces my total value gain but is negotiable)\n\nThe counteroffer to Player 1 will be [1, 0, 0, 1, 2].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 2]}",

This is the minimum value I need to achieve in the negotiation for it to be worth more than walking away.\n\n3. **Formulate an Initial Offer:**\n\n   I need to propose a division such that I retain a value greater than 465 after the negotiation while offering enough to Player 2 to make them consider accepting or counteroffering favorably.\n\n   Let's consider offering reasonable portions, ensuring I prioritize high-value items to maximize my retained value:\n\n   - Offer 0 units of item 1 (since it's highly valuable to me).\n   - Offer 3 units of item 2 (my value is low here).\n   - Offer 1 unit of item 3 (while valuable, offering a single unit might entice Player 2).\n   - Offer 2 units of item 4 (since it has high value for me, but sharing reduces negotiation friction).\n   - Offer 2 units of item 5 (retaining 2 for myself).\n\n4. **Calculate the Retained Value:**\n\n   - Retained Item 1: 2 x 71 = 142\n   - Retained Item 2: 4 x 4 = 16\n   - Retained Item 3: 2 x 13 = 26\n   - Retained Item 4: 4 x 81 = 324\n   - Retained Item 5: 2 x 53 = 106\n\n   - Total Retained Value = 142 + 16 + 26 + 324 + 106 = 614 \n\n5. **Discount Value Based on Negotiation Round:**\n\n   - As we are in round 1, the discount factor is \\( \\gamma^0 = 1 \\).\n   - Therefore, my present value from this offer is 614, which is greater than my outside offer of 465.\n\nSince the retained value of 614 is greater than my outside offer, I will proceed to make my initial offer based on the above calculations.\n\n**Initial Offer to Player 2:**\n\n- Offer [0, 3, 1, 2, 2] representing the units of each item type offered to them.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMy action is to make the following initial offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

This means in the second round, offers are worth 90% of their first-round value for evaluation. Therefore, I must carefully consider offers that significantly surpass my outside offer when adjusted for the discount factor.\n\n4. **Strategy for Negotiation:**\n\n   Since I am making the first offer, I want to ensure that the offer is closer to my maximum potential value (556) rather than the minimum (424), taking into account that Player 2 may counter and I can adjust accordingly. It\u2019s strategically beneficial to begin with a high offer to leave room for negotiation.\n\n5. **Initial Counteroffer Strategy:**\n\n   I'll make an initial offer where I keep the higher-value items for myself while giving fewer items to Player 2. Since my high-value items are mostly item 5, I should aim to keep those.\n\n   A possible division could be:\n   - I offer Player 2: \n       * 2 units of item 1\n       * 3 units of item 2\n       * 0 units of item 3\n       * 0 units of item 4\n       * 1 unit of item 5\n\n   This way, I keep a significant share of item 5 for its high value, while offering Player 2 enough such that they can potentially be interested in a counter-deal.\n\nGiven this reasoning, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the value of items in the current offer:**\n   - Item 1: 0 units (because the offer is for me and Player 1 offered 3 to me) * 70 = 0\n   - Item 2: 5 units * 37 = 185\n   - Item 3: 4 units * 84 = 336\n   - Item 4: 4 units * 85 = 340\n   - Item 5: 3 units * 25 = 75\n   - Total value for the offer = 0 + 185 + 336 + 340 + 75 = 936\n\n2. **Consider the value of the outside offer:**\n   - My outside offer is 1429.\n\n3. **Discount factor for round 1:** \n   - \\( \\text{Value of the offer with discount} = 936 \\times 0.9^0 = 936 \\)\n   \n4. **Compare the discounted offer value with the outside offer:**\n   - 936 (current offer value) is less than 1429 (outside offer value).\n\nBecause the value of accepting the current offer is less than my outside offer, which is 1429, it would not be beneficial to accept this offer as it stands.\n\n5. **Make a counteroffer:** \n   I need to make a counteroffer that increases my value to be closer to or exceed my outside offer, if possible.\n\nLet's propose an offer where:\n- I want more items that are of higher personal value to make it preferable to my outside offer.\n- Ensure Player 1 receives at least one unit of each item to keep the negotiation moving.\n\nA potential counteroffer could be:\n- Offer more of items with lower personal utility: Item 2 and Item 5.\n- Negotiate to keep more of my high-value items: Item 3 and Item 4.\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer:**\n- Give Player 1: [0, 4, 2, 2, 2]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value for the proposed counteroffer:\n- My units (left over from my offer to Player 1):\n  - Item 1: 3 * 70 = 210\n  - Item 2: 3 * 37 = 111\n  - Item 3: 3 * 84 = 252\n  - Item 4: 6 * 85 = 510\n  - Item 5: 3 * 25 = 75\n- Total value to me = 210 + 111 + 252 + 510 + 75 = 1158\n\nThe value of my counteroffer to myself is 1158, which is less than my outside offer but still keeps the negotiation open and may be adjusted in favor of higher value in the next round.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 2, 2, 2]}",

Essentially, it means I need to receive almost all the value to prefer a deal over just walking away.\n\n### Strategy\nGiven that my outside offer is a significant share of the total value, my approach should aim to retain as much total item value as possible, only offering minimal amounts to Player 2. I'll aim to propose an offer that keeps most high-value items with me.\n\n### Initial Offer\nWe know my valuation for each item, so I should try to offer what minimally reduces my total value but still could seem somewhat reasonable as a starting point for negotiation. Since item 3 and item 5 have the lowest value to me, I'll start by offering those plus a minimal amount from the less valuable high-value items.\n\nHere's the offer breakdown:\n- Item 1 (value/unit 17): Offer 1 unit to minimize loss.\n- Item 2 (value/unit 70): Offer 0 units since it's the most valuable.\n- Item 3 (value/unit 3): Offer 3 units (it's very low-valued to me).\n- Item 4 (value/unit 10): Offer 0 units to retain value.\n- Item 5 (value/unit 5): Offer 3 units (lower value).\n\nWith this calculation:\n- My retained value after offer: \n  - Item 1: (6-1) * 17 = 85\n  - Item 2: 4 * 70 = 280\n  - Item 3: (4-3) * 3 = 3\n  - Item 4: 2 * 10 = 20\n  - Item 5: (4-3) * 5 = 5\n  - Total retained value = 85 + 280 + 3 + 20 + 5 = 393\n\nWith a retained value of 393, which is more than what I'd receive from my outside offer in terms of negotiation value, this approach should still be favorable unless Player 2 makes a substantially better offer. \n\nNow to provide a counteroffer in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 3, 0, 3]}\n```",

Gammas (0.9)^1 = 0.9. Hence, the adjusted value of the offer is 319 * 0.9 = 287.1.\n\n3. **Comparison with Outside Offer**: My outside offer is 433, which means if I walk away, I will receive a value of 433.\n\n4. **Accept or Counteroffer Logic**: The current offer from Player 2 is valued at 287.1 for me, which is significantly lower than my outside offer of 433. Accepting this offer would lead to a lesser value than walking away.\n\n5. **Counteroffer Consideration**: Given that my outside offer (433) is higher, I should aim to propose a distribution that increases my net value closer to my outside offer. Player 2's last counteroffer showed they were willing to give a significant portion of the items, so they might accept fewer items if I propose a slightly more favorable offer from their perspective.\n\n   - My counteroffer should allow me to keep more valuable items aligning with my value, improving the offer while balancing Player 2\u2019s potential value needs.\n\n6. **Strategizing the Counteroffer**: My values suggest I should prioritize securing more of item 2 (value 70) and item 1 (value 17) to maximize my gain. Here's a potential counteroffer:\n\n   - Offer the minimal units of items, focusing on keeping valuable units for myself (the opposite of what Player 2 proposed).\n\nConsidering these factors, my counteroffer aims to increase my gain slightly closer to what I value, fostering a chance for acceptance in the final round if Player 2 sees value in this new proposal.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 2, 2]}\n```",

My private outside offer is 357.\n\nGiven that this is the first round (round 1), there is no immediate discount on my total value. Therefore, my goal is to propose an offer that maximizes my retained value while being potentially acceptable to Player 2.\n\nTo set a reasonable initial offer:\n- I should keep items that have high value for me and might not be as valuable to Player 2.\n- My assumption is Player 2 will have different valuations and might prioritize items I value less.\n\nAn intuitive approach might be to offer items I value less to see if Player 2 finds them valuable. I could start by offering:\n- Offer all units of Item 1 as it has the lowest per-unit value to me.\n- Offer some units of Item 4 and Item 5 to diversify what I'm offering, but retain some since their values are moderate for me, yet might be crucial for trade.\n\nHere's a strategic initial offer:\n- Item 1: 5 units (all)\n- Item 2: 0 units (none)\n- Item 3: 0 units (none)\n- Item 4: 2 units\n- Item 5: 2 units\n\nThis offer:\n- Retains my high-value items (Item 3 and some of Items 4 and 5) while offering a significant amount of the lowest value items for me.\n- Enables me to test the water across multiple items to gauge Player 2's reactions.\n\nBy offering some units of items I value moderately, I attempt to strike a balance between retaining a high value for myself and making the offer attractive enough for Player 2 to consider.\n\nBased on this reasoning, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 0, 2, 2]}\n```",

Therefore, I should either walk away or make a counteroffer that increases my total value closer to 781.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy:\nTo create a counteroffer, I aim to boost my share of the items to meet or exceed my outside offer value. The target is to improve the offer without overly disadvantaging Player 1 or creating an unrealistic counteroffer.\n\nTo increase the value:\n- **Item 1** is most valuable to me. I will try to receive more units.\n- Adjust item distribution slightly, focusing mainly on item 1 and item 4, which also has a decent value for me.\n\n### Counteroffer Calculation:\n- Keep more units of **Item 1** and **Item 4**.\n- Offer balanced proportions.\n\nI will propose: \n\n- Give Player 1: 2 units of Item 1, 3 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 1 units of Item 4, 1 units of Item 5.\n\nCalculating my total value with this counteroffer:\n\n- **Item 1**: 6 units (8 - 2 offered) \u00d7 96 = 576\n- **Item 2**: 3 units (6 - 3 offered) \u00d7 30 = 90\n- **Item 3**: 1 unit (1 - 0 offered) \u00d7 22 = 22\n- **Item 4**: 3 units (4 - 1 offered) \u00d7 30 = 90\n- **Item 5**: 2 units (3 - 1 offered) \u00d7 10 = 20\n\nTotal with new counteroffer = 576 + 90 + 22 + 90 + 20 = 798\n\nThis total exceeds my outside value, which is a good reason for me to propose this counteroffer.\n\n### Conclusion:\nI will make a counteroffer with this distribution to maximize my value without walking away. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Walking away would guarantee a value of 222, which is higher.\n\nSince this is round 2 and I can make a counteroffer, let's aim to increase the total value beyond 222 considering the discount factor.\n\nA reasonable counteroffer could be to request more of the items with the highest value to me, such as Item 5.

Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. **Evaluate My Total Value of Items:**\n   - Item 1: 3 units, value 7 each = 21\n   - Item 2: 0 units, value 43 each = 0\n   - Item 3: 2 units, value 62 each = 124\n   - Item 4: 9 units, value 50 each = 450\n   - Item 5: 3 units, value 80 each = 240\n   - Total value = 835\n\n2. **Current Offer from Player 2:** [1, 0, 0, 4, 1]\n   - Using the values:\n     - Item 1: 2 units to me (21 - 7 = 14 value remains)\n     - Item 2: 0 units (no change, 0 value remains)\n     - Item 3: 2 units to me (124 value remains)\n     - Item 4: 5 units to me (450 - 200 = 250 value remains)\n     - Item 5: 2 units to me (240 - 80 = 160 value remains)\n   - Total value if I accept: 548 (after offering items)\n\n3. **Adjust for Discount Factor (Round 2):**\n   - Discount factor for round 2: \\(0.9^{2-1} = 0.9\\)\n   - Adjusted value if I accept: \\(548 \\times 0.9 = 493.2\\)\n\n4. **Compare to Outside Offer:**\n   - My outside offer is valued at 494.\n\n5. **Decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 493.2, which is slightly less than my outside offer of 494.\n   - Since accepting yields a slightly lower value than my outside offer, walking away is slightly preferable.\n   - A more aggressive counteroffer could potentially improve my outcome.\n\nCounteroffer Considerations:\n   - To exceed my outside offer, I should try a distribution where I get higher total adjusted values.\n   - Focusing on higher-valued items, I might adjust the offer to retain more high-value items.\n\nMy counteroffer will be: [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n   - Item 1: Offer 1 (Retain 2, Value 14)\n   - Item 2: Offer 0 (Retain 0, Value 0)\n   - Item 3: Offer 1 (Retain 1, Value 62)\n   - Item 4: Offer 2 (Retain 7, Value 350)\n   - Item 5: Offer 1 (Retain 2, Value 160)\n   - Total retained: 586 (subject to 0.9 factor): 586 * 0.9 = 527.4\n\nThus, the counteroffer gives me more value adjusted for discount than the current or outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]}",

Accepting this would result in a much lower utility compared to walking away with my outside offer.\n\nGiven that it is only round 1 and we have additional rounds to negotiate, it's worthwhile to attempt a counteroffer that provides me with a value at least higher than 648, before accounting for future discounts.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy:\nLet's aim to maximize my value without risking an outright rejection. I should try a more favorable division with this aim in mind. Here's a proposal to ensure my total value from items is notably higher:\n\n- **Counteroffer to Player 1:**\n  - 0 units of item 1 (kept for me)\n  - 1 units of item 2 (kept for me, as item 2 has a lower value than item 1 and 3, maybe they'll accept more of these)\n  - 0 units of item 3 (kept for me)\n  - 2 units of item 4 (given to them, as I need some compromise)\n  - 2 units of item 5 (given to them, less valuable to me)\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \\* 80 = 240\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \\* 65 = 130\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \\* 82 = 164\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \\* 85 = 85\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \\* 12 = 12\n\nWith this I would have a value of: 240 + 130 + 164 + 85 + 12 = 631\n\nThis is an improvement over the current offer but slightly below my outside offer without further rounds. Given the nature of negotiation, it\u2019s strategic to start higher.\n\n### Conclusion:\nI will make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 2, 2]}\n```",

Item 1: 2 units, value to me = 2 x 90 = 180\n2. Item 2: 2 units, value to me = 2 x 68 = 136\n3. Item 3: 1 unit, value to me = 1 x 10 = 10\n4. Item 4: 2 units, value to me = 2 x 22 = 44\n5. Item 5: 1 unit, value to me = 1 x 85 = 85\n\nTotal value = 180 + 136 + 10 + 44 + 85 = 455\n- Adjusted value with discount = 0.9 x 455 = 409.5\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe adjusted value of this counteroffer still doesn't exceed my outside option, but it brings me closer while maximizing my value in the negotiation. \n\nThus, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

However, for evaluation against the outside offer, I'll keep this in mind but first compare the raw values for clarity.\n  \n4. **My Outside Offer:**\n   - My guaranteed outside offer value is 183.\n   - Without considering the discount yet, the offer value of 706 is significantly higher than my outside offer.\n\n5. **Comparison with My Outside Offer:**\n   - Current offer's value (706) > Outside offer (183).\n   - This makes the current offer more valuable than the outside option.\n\n6. **Strategy Consideration:**\n   - My aim is to maximize my value. The value of the current offer is much greater than my outside option. Given the substantial difference in the value of the offer compared to my outside offer, even with any potential reduction from negotiation rounds or potential future counteroffers, the current offer is immediately compelling.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most logical course of action is to accept the current offer, as it maximizes my immediate value and exceeds my outside option value significantly.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Clearly, 252 from the current offer is significantly lower than 1389.\n\nGiven this comparison, accepting the current offer would not be beneficial. I should try to make a counteroffer that maximizes my value without going below 1389, even after discounting.\n\n4. **Counteroffer Calculation:**  \n   I need to offer Player 2 a distribution that potentially leaves me with a much higher value than the 252 from the current offer, even after discounting. Ideally, I want a distribution that gives me a value greater than my discounted outside offer (1389 * 0.9^1 = 1250.1), or as close to it as possible.\n\n   Items I value highly and should try to retain the most of are items 3, 4, and 5.\n\n5. **Construct a Counteroffer:**  \n   - To keep a higher value, let's try [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]. This is more favorable to me than my initial offer in terms of higher units of high-value items 4 and 5.\n   \n   Let's see this counteroffer's value:  \n   - **Item 1:** 3 units left for me -> 3 * 50 = 150  \n   - **Item 2:** 5 units left for me -> 5 * 35 = 175  \n   - **Item 3:** 5 units left for me -> 5 * 80 = 400  \n   - **Item 4:** 3 units left for me -> 3 * 89 = 267  \n   - **Item 5:** 5 units left for me -> 5 * 67 = 335  \n   \n   Total value = 150 + 175 + 400 + 267 + 335 = 1327  \n   Discounted value = 1327 * 0.9 = 1194.3\n\nWhile this isn't higher than the discounted outside offer, it's better than player 2's current offer. Since outright walking gives 1389 directly without any discount concern, I'd ensure the counteroffer value is compelling enough to play another round.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]}",

This is attractive if Player 1 values something else more strongly:\n   - **Item 1 to Player 1:** 0\n   - **Item 2 to Player 1:** 5 (I keep 3)\n   - **Item 3 to Player 1:** 3 (I keep 2)\n   - **Item 4 to Player 1:** 1 (I keep 5)\n   - **Item 5 to Player 1:** 2 (I keep 5)\n\nChecking value for me from this arrangement:\n- Item 1: 3 * 80 = 240\n- Item 2: 3 * 79 = 237\n- Item 3: 2 * 39 = 78\n- Item 4: 5 * 72 = 360\n- Item 5: 5 * 77 = 385\n\nTotal value = 240 + 237 + 78 + 360 + 385 = 1300.\n\nThis counters with an offer still under the outside offer accounting for discount but potentially more valuable to Player 1 than their initial. Since we're proposing more now but awaiting evaluation and gameplay improvements or counter-counters depending on Player 1's values, this can advance the negotiation significantly.\n\nTherefore, making the counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 3, 1, 2]}\n```",

Therefore, the discount factor applied is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n- Discounted value = 817 * 0.9 = 735.3\n\n**Step 3: Compare Against My Outside Offer**\n- My outside offer is valued at 1578.\n\nThe current discounted value of Player 1's offer (735.3) is less than my outside offer value (1578). Thus, accepting this offer would give me a lower value than walking away with my outside offer.\n\n**Step 4: Consider Making a Counteroffer**\n- In the final round, any counteroffer is considered a walk. Thus, this is my last opportunity to counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that might bring more value to me:\n- Focus on the higher value items for me: item 1, item 2, item 4, and item 5.\n- Based on remaining quantities, a possible redistribution could be [1, 5, 0, 1, 2] to Player 1, to get higher value units for myself.\n\nRecalculate the values for:\n- Items I would receive:  \n  - Item 1: 2 units (value = 160)\n  - Item 2: 3 units (value = 237)\n  - Item 3: 4 units (value = 156)\n  - Item 4: 5 units (value = 360)\n  - Item 5: 5 units (value = 385)\n\n  Total value if Player 1 accepts my counter is 1298, without applying the discount.\n\n  *Discounted value of this potential offer = 1298 * 0.9 = 1168.2.*\n\nBy shifting the balance further, while remaining reasonable, my countervalue comes closer to myself but still far from my outside offer.\n\nGiven this analysis, it's strategically still beneficial to counteroffer. \n\nCounteroffer:\n- Offer: [1, 5, 0, 1, 2]\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 0, 1, 2]}",

It is not beneficial for me to accept this offer. Walking away guarantees a value of 1180 for me without further risk.\n\n### Making a Counteroffer:\nI need to propose an offer that could potentially increase my value while staying realistic to possibly gain Player 1's acceptance.\n\n#### Counteroffer Proposal:\nTo negotiate a deal better than my outside offer, my aim should be to improve the value significantly towards at least matching or exceeding my outside offer value after accounting for the discount. \n\n### Let's propose:\n1. Take control of high-value items for myself while giving less valuable items to Player 1.\n2. Adjust an offer where I control more units of items 1, 4, and 3 which are very crucial given my high values for these.\n\n#### New Counteroffer Action:\n- Give Player 1: [1, 1, 0, 3, 3]\n  - I Receive: [2, 1, 2, 4, 3]\n\n- Calculating potential value:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit * 74 = 74\n  - Item 2: 1 unit * 82 = 82\n  - Item 3: 0 units * 75 = 0\n  - Item 4: 3 units * 85 = 255\n  - Item 5: 3 units * 59 = 177\n  - Total given to Player 1 = 588\n\n- Calculating what I keep:\n  - Item 1: 2 units * 74 = 148\n  - Item 2: 1 unit * 82 = 82\n  - Item 3: 2 units * 75 = 150\n  - Item 4: 4 units * 85 = 340\n  - Item 5: 3 units * 59 = 177\n  - Total value = 897\n\n- This still doesn't reach my outside offer when discounted, so let's improve it by giving less of high value items to Player 1.\n\n#### Final Counteroffer:\nUnsafe to change the deal smaller extensively due to the lack of available information about Player 1's values at this round.\n\nThus, ideal action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n\nThis ensures I receive my outside offer value of 1180 without taking undue risk since the negotiation offer stands far from acceptable.",

My focus should be on obtaining a deal that exceeds my outside offer of 326. To form this strategy, I need to balance between what I'm attaining in value and what I'm offering.\n\nSince I will be making the initial offer, I can start by proposing a distribution that gives me a higher percentage of the overall value, leaving room for negotiation. Therefore, I will propose an offer skewed in my favor initially, understanding that future rounds might require concessions.\n\n### Proposed Offer to Player 2:\nI want to persuade player 2 to engage in negotiation while still benefiting substantially myself.

Calculate the units I receive for each item based on Player 1's offer and the total available units:\n   - Item 1: Total 4 units - 1 offered to Player 1 = 3 units for me\n   - Item 2: Total 3 units - 3 offered to Player 1 = 0 units for me\n   - Item 3: Total 4 units - 1 offered to Player 1 = 3 units for me\n   - Item 4: Total 2 units - 0 offered to Player 1 = 2 units for me\n   - Item 5: Total 3 units - 1 offered to Player 1 = 2 units for me\n\n2. Calculate my value for the offer based on my item preferences:\n   - Item 1: 3 units * 38 = 114\n   - Item 2: 0 units * 90 = 0\n   - Item 3: 3 units * 5 = 15\n   - Item 4: 2 units * 36 = 72\n   - Item 5: 2 units * 10 = 20\n\n   Total value from the offer = 114 + 0 + 15 + 72 + 20 = 221\n\n3. Compare this value to my outside offer:\n   - My outside offer is 113.\n\n4. Considering the discount factor (gamma = 0.9), in round 1, the effective value from the negotiation is not discounted yet.\n\nSince 221 > 113, the current offer is better than my outside option.

Therefore, the value from this offer is still 373 in this round.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Current offer value (373) is significantly lower than my outside offer value (485).\n   - The value I gain from staying in the negotiation must be higher than 485, especially if the negotiation proceeds into further rounds where the discount factor applies.\n\n5. **Counteroffer**:\n   - I would need to propose a counteroffer where the value of the items I receive totals more than 485.\n   - Aiming for more favorable allocation, let's try offering Player 1 an offer that keeps valuable items for myself:\n     - Let me propose a counteroffer that boosts my value:\n       - I can offer Player 1: [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n       - This would leave me with: [1, 3, 3, 1, 2]\n     - Value from this counteroffer:\n       - Item 1: 1 unit (value: 1 * 9 = 9)\n       - Item 2: 3 units (value: 3 * 63 = 189)\n       - Item 3: 3 units (value: 3 * 33 = 99)\n       - Item 4: 1 unit (value: 1 * 46 = 46)\n       - Item 5: 2 units (value: 2 * 36 = 72)\n     - Total value: 9 + 189 + 99 + 46 + 72 = 415\n\nThe value 415 is still less than 485, indicating even this isn't advantageous. I realize I need more units or another strategic combination, yet finding the optimal one while ensuring it passes my threshold is proving complex. Thus, I'll attempt to improve negotiations slightly again. Let's reassess what I can keep as much valuable item, especially Item 2:\n\n**Revised Counteroffer**: [0, 1, 2, 1, 3] \n\n- This proposed distribution yields:\n  - Player 1: [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n  - Me (Player 2): [0, 1, 2, 1, 3]\n\n- Calculating received value:\n  - Item 1: 0 unit (0 value)\n  - Item 2: 1 unit (1 * 63 = 63)\n  - Item 3: 2 units (2 * 33 = 66)\n  - Item 4: 1 unit (1 * 46 = 46)\n  - Item 5: 3 units (3 * 36 = 108)\n\n- Total value = 0 + 63 + 66 + 46 + 108 = 283 (Still lower than 485)\n\nThis indicates a complex counteroffer. Given initial constraints and not finding optimal realignment, outright walking emerges as optimal, safeguarding my 485 outside offer exceeds anything foreseeably countered.\n\nHence, moving to secure outside offer gain, I reach walk decision:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting more value, but needing to ensure it doesn't result in a worse offer or Player 1 walking away.\n\nGiven that 582 is substantially less than 1088, I should aim to make a counteroffer that has a value for me closer to my outside offer and see if Player 1 accepts it in the subsequent rounds. An aggressive counteroffer is needed to bridge the gap between this offer and my outside offer. I should aim for a balance between negotiation value and getting as close as possible to my demanding threshold.\n\nI'll try to take more valuable items based on my preferences in the counteroffer.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal (that slightly favors my valuation and hopes for future bargaining):**\n- Offer Player 1: [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n  - I receive: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n\nBased on my valuations, let\u2019s calculate the value of what I would receive in this offer:\n- Value from item 1: 4 units \u00d7 73 = 292\n- Value from item 2: 3 units \u00d7 98 = 294\n- Value from item 3: 0 units \u00d7 74 = 0\n- Value from item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 26 = 26\n- Value from item 5: 2 units \u00d7 69 = 138\n\nTotal value to me = 292 + 294 + 0 + 26 + 138 = 750\n\nThis is a more favorable arrangement closer to my outside offer's value.

My private valuation per item is:\n   - Item 1: 70\n   - Item 2: 61\n   - Item 3: 3\n   - Item 4: 44\n   - Item 5: 84\n\n   The total value of all items is 446.\n\n2. **Outside Offer**: My outside offer is 19, which is relatively low compared to the total value of all items. This means I'm incentivized to strike a deal that maximizes my item values.\n\n3. **Discount Rate**: Each round of negotiation reduces the present value of any potential deal due to a discount factor of 0.9. Delaying a deal reduces the effective payout.\n\n4. **Initial Offer Strategy**: As the first player in round 1, I have to make an initial partition of items, leaving some with Player 2 and keeping others for myself. Ideal initial offers should favor items of low value to me while attempting to retain highly valued items.\n\n5. **Choice of Counteroffer**:\n   - Prioritize retaining as many units of high-value items (item 1 and item 2) as possible.\n   - Be flexible with low-value item (item 3), giving a larger portion.\n   - Balance item 4 since it has moderate value, ensuring the offer remains attractive.\n\nWith these factors in mind, my initial offer to Player 2 would aim to keep the higher value predominately:\n- Offer 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This leaves me with 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4.\n\nCalculating my retained value with the offer:\n- Item 1: 2 units * 70 = 140\n- Item 2: 2 units * 61 = 122\n- Item 3: 1 unit * 3 = 3\n- Item 4: 1 unit * 44 = 44\n- Item 5: 0 unit * 84 = 0\n- Total Value: 140 + 122 + 3 + 44 = 309\n\nThis strategy should yield a present value of 309, against a fallback of 19, aligning with my objective to acquire significant value.\n\nThus, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

Let's determine the value of this distribution for me:\n\n- **Item 1**: 1 unit at 74 per unit = 74\n- **Item 2**: 1 unit at 28 per unit = 28\n- **Item 3**: 2 units at 40 per unit = 80\n- **Item 4**: 0 units at 38 per unit = 0\n- **Item 5**: 0 units at 31 per unit = 0\n\nTotal value of the current offer: 74 + 28 + 80 + 0 + 0 = 182\n\n### Outside Offer Evaluation\nMy outside offer value is 15.\n\n### Decision Factors\n- My value from the current offer is 182, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 15.\n- If I accept now, I get the value of 182 without any discount.\n- Given the discount rate of 0.9, if I enter the next round, any deal would be worth 0.9 times its face value.\n\nGiven that the current deal provides me significantly more than my outside option, and considering future rounds would discount the value, accepting this offer could be favorable. However, I should consider if I can make a counteroffer that improves my position without risking a worse outcome in subsequent rounds.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy\nTo improve my outcome, I should try to increase the items that have the highest value to me moderately without risking a collapse in negotiations. My most valuable items are:\n\n- Item 1: 74 per unit\n- Item 3: 40 per unit\n\nStaying reasonable, I aim to propose a slight increase in these that respects both negotiation balance and fairness.\n\nLet's propose I take 2 units of item 1 (giving 1 to Player 1) and keep 2 units of item 3 (giving 1 to Player 1):\n\n### Counteroffer:\n- **Item 1**: Offer 1 unit (I keep 2)\n- **Item 2**: Offer 2 units (I keep 1)\n- **Item 3**: Offer 1 unit (I keep 2)\n- **Item 4**: Offer 0 units (I keep 0)\n- **Item 5**: Offer 0 units (I keep 0)\n\nNew distribution offered to Player 1: [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]\n\nThis distribution attempts to improve my standing with a slight shift in the items with higher weight for me. I aim to secure a better outcome on these more valuable items while ensuring the total offer isn't seen as unfair, considering the value perceptions are different for Player 1 as well.\n\nTherefore, my decision is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

I can offer a higher portion of items 1, 2, and 5, hoping Player 2 values these items.\n\n#### Potential Offer:\n- Offer player 2:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit (keeping 3 * 40 = 120)\n  - Item 2: 2 units (keeping 5 * 44 = 220)\n  - Item 3: 0 units (keeping 3 * 81 = 243)\n  - Item 4: 2 units (keeping 2 * 48 = 96)\n  - Item 5: 1 unit (keeping 2 * 44 = 88)\n\n### Offer Evaluation:\n- My portion: (3 * 40) + (5 * 44) + (3 * 81) + (2 * 48) + (2 * 44)\n- My portion: 120 + 220 + 243 + 96 + 88 = 767\n\nThis offer gives me a calculated value of 767, which is below 1035 but would require an adjustment by Player 2 to reach an acceptable deal or for them to counteroffer.\n\n#### Action:\nGiven the above analysis and my need to outperform the outside offer adjusted by multiple rounds, I will provide the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 2, 1]}",

One potential viable offer could involve adjusting towards my value:\n\n- Proposed counteroffer: [0, 1, 0, 1, 4]\n  - This gives Player 2:\n    - Item 1: 0 unit\n    - Item 2: 1 unit\n    - Item 3: 0 units\n    - Item 4: 1 unit\n    - Item 5: 4 units\n\n- My items:\n  - Item 1: 2 units\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 1 unit\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 2 units\n\nMy resulting value from accepting my own counteroffer (should Player 2 accept) would be higher than the current offer.

My highest valued items are:\n\n- Item 5: Value per unit = 85\n- Item 3: Value per unit = 72\n- Item 4: Value per unit = 50\n\nGiven the total items available:\n- Item 1: 2 units\n- Item 2: 4 units\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 4 units\n- Item 5: 6 units\n\nFor a counteroffer, I can propose that I keep more of items 5 and 3 potentially, altering the balance for maximum gain.\n\n### My Counteroffer Proposal\nOne option is to offer Player 1:\n- 0 units of item 1 (I take all)\n- 0 units of item 2 (I take all)\n- 0 units of item 3 (I take all)\n- 2 units of item 4 (I get equal share)\n- 4 units of item 5 (I give up an additional unit)\n\nThis yields Player 1:\n- Item 5: 4 units\n\nLeaving me with:\n- Item 1: 2 units * 17 = 34\n- Item 2: 4 units * 43 = 172\n- Item 3: 1 unit * 72 = 72\n- Item 4: 2 units * 50 = 100\n- Item 5: 2 units * 85 = 170\n\nTotal = 34 + 172 + 72 + 100 + 170 = 548\n\nAdjusted with discount = 548 * 0.9 = 493.2\n\nSince this adjusted value (493.2) is lower than my outside option, but still relatively closer, I will make this counteroffer hoping Player 1 can value items 5 sufficiently to justify my counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 1, 2, 4]}\n```",

I'll aim for a distribution where my value exceeds the discounted value of my outside offer while still leaving some incentive for Player 2 to accept.\n\nPossible Counteroffer Design:\nI could keep a significant portion of high-value items for myself to try and increase my total value. Let's give Player 2 a portion of each type but skew it towards my highest perceived value.\n\nCounteroffer proposal to Player 2: [2, 0, 3, 0, 2]\n\nMy proposed counteroffer:\n- Item 1: 3 units for me, 2 units for Player 2\n- Item 2: 2 units for me, 0 units for Player 2\n- Item 3: 5 units for me, 3 units for Player 2\n- Item 4: 2 units for me, 0 unit for Player 2\n- Item 5: 4 units for me, 2 units for Player 2\n\nLet's calculate the value for me:\n- Value from item 1 = 3 * 58 = 174\n- Value from item 2 = 2 * 21 = 42\n- Value from item 3 = 5 * 65 = 325\n- Value from item 4 = 2 * 39 = 78\n- Value from item 5 = 4 * 89 = 356\n\nTotal value = 174 + 42 + 325 + 78 + 356 = 975\nDiscounted value (0.9): 975 * 0.9 = 877.5\n\nThis counteroffer boosts my value to 877.5, which still might not surpass my outside offer, but should keep Player 2 engaged while enhancing my position from their current offer.

Thus, I need resources that increase the value above 768, especially given the reduction in value due to the discount rate in the final round.\n   - Given Player 2 values items differently, an offer that both provides me with an adequate deal and may engage Player 2 could include fewer high-value items they might not prioritize.\n\n5. **Potential Counteroffer**:\n   - I should aim to secure enough units of higher-valued items to ensure a total adequate value adjusted by the future discount (0.9^2), which means getting a higher immediate value to counter diminishing returns.\n   - A counteroffer targeting their possible lower preference for my high-value items might involve taking full advantage of item 3 due to its high value to me.\n   - Possible counteroffer: [7, 0, 0, 0, 2]. \n     - This keeps the less valuable item 1 and item 5, appealing if they value other items higher.\n\nSince Player 2 has shown willingness to share item 5, but I need more to counter against the discount and achieve closer to 768, let's slightly modify offer keeping higher value items.\n\n**Final Counteroffer**: Adjust to slightly less aggressive to leave more of item 5 with them.

Making a counteroffer might risk losing this favorable position.\n   - Given that the value I receive is much higher than my outside offer, it's better to secure the current deal rather than risk it in further negotiation rounds.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe current offer significantly benefits me versus my outside offer, even when considering the discount factor in subsequent rounds. Therefore, accepting it is the most strategic choice at this point in the negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Compare the value of the offer with my outside option which is 189.\n\nThe current offer's value (454) is significantly higher than my outside option (189), meaning accepting this offer would be beneficial.\n\nThe negotiation could potentially have more rounds, during which I might try to increase my value. However, given that the offer already surpasses my outside option by a substantial amount, and considering the risk of receiving a lower offer or ending up with the outside offer in subsequent rounds, it would be strategic to accept this beneficial offer now.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

I could offer more of this item.\n- Offer 1 of item 1 and 1 of item 2, as they are of moderately high value but offering partly might help gain acceptance.\n- Keep item 4 entirely to myself as its value is very high.\n- Offer 1 of item 5 while keeping most of it due to high value.\n\nA possible initial offer to Player 2 might be:\n- [1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5] \n\nValue retention for me:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (86) + 1 unit of item 2 (76) + 1 unit of item 3 (45) + 1 unit of item 4 (81) + 1 unit of item 5 (91) = 86 + 76 + 45 + 81 + 91 = 379\n\nValue obtained by Player 2 from the offer (assuming moderate values):\n- 1 unit of item 1 (X) + 1 unit of item 2 (X) + 2 units of item 3 (X each) + 0 units of item 4 (X) + 1 unit of item 5 (X) \n\nIt may provide an even division depending on Player 2's valuation.\n\nConsidering these thoughts, let's proceed with a strategic opening offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]}\n```",

Securing most of these while offering the others in a manner I believe might still keep Player 2 interested and above their outside offer might let me push for an advantageous initial offer.\n\n### Initial Offer:\nTo start the negotiation process, I will offer:\n\n- **Item 1:** 1 unit (keeping 3 for myself)\n- **Item 2:** 1 unit (entirety)\n- **Item 3:** 2 units (keeping 1 for myself)\n- **Item 4:** 2 units (keeping 1 for myself)\n- **Item 5:** 1 unit (keeping 2 for myself)\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer:** [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]\n\nThis offer ensures that I hold onto the majority of the items that have significantly high values to me (Item 1 and Item 5) and distribute the other items, attempting to hit the balance where my value retained is above 666, assuming the counterparty has interest in other items that might not be as valuable to me but are crucial to them.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

Moreover, any counteroffer or decision to walk away is likely to reduce my potential gains because Player 1 might not accept, or the negotiation could fail, leaving me only with my outside offer value.\n\nTherefore, the optimal action is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If I walk away, I get 688.\n\n### Step 3: Decide the Action\n\nSince the value of the current offer to me (387) is less than my outside offer (688), it is not beneficial for me to accept the current offer. Therefore, I should either make a counteroffer or choose to walk away. As it is only round 1, it may be beneficial to attempt a counteroffer.\n\n### Step 4: Make a Counteroffer\n\nI need to retain items or quantities that maximize my value given my private values. A simple strategy is to ensure that the value I receive is closer to or exceeds the current round discount-adjusted outside option if I counteroffer.\n\nIf I make a counteroffer intending to improve my share of items, consider retaining all of item 2 because it has the highest unit value for me and adjust other items slightly.\n\nLet's propose an offer that improves my value considerably:\n\nTrying an offer giving Player 1 some of other items, with more item 1 due to its lower value to me:\n\n- [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n\nFor me, this means I would receive:\n\n- 1 unit of item 1 (value = 1 * 28 = 28)\n- 4 units of item 2 (value = 4 * 74 = 296)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (value = 1 * 29 = 29)\n- 4 units of item 4 (value = 4 * 40 = 160)\n- 2 units of item 5 (value = 2 * 22 = 44)\n\nThe total value = 28 + 296 + 29 + 160 + 44 = 557\n\nWith a discount applied for the subsequent round, this would still offer more prospectively than the current offer with a potential to negotiate.\n\nTherefore, I will propose this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

Total value = 2 * 70 = 140.\n- **Item 4:** Offered 2 units. My value per unit is 98. Total value = 2 * 98 = 196.\n- **Item 5:** Offered 1 unit. My value per unit is 4. Total value = 1 * 4 = 4.\n\nTotal value of the offer = 26 + 0 + 140 + 196 + 4 = 366.\n\nThe value with the discount factor for round 1 (since gamma^0 = 1):\n- Adjusted offer value = 366 * 1 = 366.\n\n### Comparison to Outside Offer\n\nMy outside offer is 827, which means I would receive 827 if I choose to WALK away. Currently, the offer of 366 is significantly less than my outside offer of 827.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that my outside offer is 827, which is much higher than the adjusted value of Player 1's offer (366), it is not in my best interest to accept this offer as it stands or to walk away since I still have room to negotiate for a potentially better deal.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy\n\nTo make a useful counteroffer, I will attempt to negotiate for higher-value items that will increase my total value. My approach will focus on getting more of item 4, which has the highest individual value for me at 98 per unit:\n\n- **Counteroffer Proposal:** \n  - I will offer Player 1: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0].\n\nIn this counteroffer, I am trying to secure:\n- **Item 1:** 2 units (value = 2 * 13 = 26)\n- **Item 2:** 1 unit (value = 1 * 52 = 52)\n- **Item 3:** 2 units (value = 2 * 70 = 140)\n- **Item 4:** 4 units (value = 4 * 98 = 392)\n- **Item 5:** 3 units (value = 3 * 4 = 12)\n\nTotal value = 26 + 52 + 140 + 392 + 12 = 622.\n\n622 is still lower than my outside offer of 827, but this counteroffer tests if Player 1 is willing to concede more. If they resist, I may reconsider the offer based on subsequent rounds and adjusted values due to the discount factor.\n\n### Action\n\nTherefore, my action is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]}\n```",

Here's my step-by-step evaluation:\n\n1. **Current Offer Evaluation:**\n   - I am being offered:\n     - 1 unit of item 1, with a value of 13 each.\n     - 0 units of item 2, with a value of 52 each.\n     - 1 unit of item 3, with a value of 70 each.\n     - 1 unit of item 4, with a value of 98 each.\n     - 0 units of item 5, with a value of 4 each.\n   - Total value from current offer: \n     - \\(1 \\times 13 + 0 \\times 52 + 1 \\times 70 + 1 \\times 98 + 0 \\times 4 = 13 + 70 + 98 = 181\\).\n\n2. **Adjusted Value with Discount Factor:**\n   - The negotiation is now in round 2, so the discount factor is \\( \\gamma = 0.9 \\).\n   - Adjusted value of the offer: \n     - \\( 181 \\times 0.9^{1} = 181 \\times 0.9 = 162.9 \\).\n\n3. **Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n   - My outside offer is 827. This is significantly higher than the adjusted value of the current offer (162.9).\n\n4. **Counteroffer Consideration:**\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that gives me more value than what is currently on the table and potentially more than Player 1 would accept.\n   - However, if I make a counteroffer in round 2 and we reach round 3 without an agreement, this will result in a WALK.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven that my outside offer (827) is greater than the discounted current offer value (162.9), I should choose to WALK away since any further delay will continue to degrade the value through discounting and likely remain below my outside offer value. There is little incentive to continue given the disparity.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

My goal is to secure an outcome above 1349 after factoring in the discount.\n\nGiven the high outside offer and the fact that any deal must discount the item's value by 0.9 for this round, the escalated value needs to compensate for this.\n\nMy initial strategy will be to secure as much of the higher valued items as possible or propose a division that exceeds the outside offer value after discount adjustment.\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer:**\n\n- I will retain the highest value items (Item 2 and Item 5) primarily since they have high per-unit values.\n  \nThus, I propose to give Player 2:\n- 0 units of Item 1 \n- 2 units of Item 2 \n- 2 units of Item 3 \n- 2 units of Item 4 \n- 1 unit of Item 5\n\nNew calculation of values for this counteroffer:\n- My retained items: \n  - Item 1: 2 * 37 = 74\n  - Item 2: 4 * 80 = 320\n  - Item 3: 4 * 63 = 252\n  - Item 4: 2 * 33 = 66\n  - Item 5: 4 * 93 = 372\n  \nTotal retained value = 74 + 320 + 252 + 66 + 372 = 1084\n\nTo ensure considering the discount factor \\(\\gamma = 0.9\\), the present value will be \\(1084 \\times 0.9 = 975.6\\).\n\nDespite the offered value, after applying the discount of 0.9 in round 1, this still does not reach the outside offer value of 1349.\n\nSince the discounted value is less than my outside offer, my counteroffer follows from offering less optimal configurations to Player 2 to encompass their value and align with a potential higher retained total value or reaching an outcome potentially above the offer.\n\nTherefore, adapting the offer while pursuing suitable flexibility with the highest value retained items may entail dynamically allowing further room within consecutive rounds subject to Player 2 assumptions or reaching final configurations.\n\nHere's my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

Accepting now would not be optimal as I'd end up with less value compared to just taking my outside offer.\n   - I should make a counteroffer that tries to improve my value to at least match my outside offer, while also considering future discounting.\n\n5. **Propose Counteroffer**:\n   - Let's try a more favorable distribution, such as asking for more units of the higher-valued items for me.\n   - I'll offer Player 1 one less unit in items where they held more in the offer to me (i.e., item 4).\n\nCounteroffer:\n- Offer Player 1: [0, 0, 1, 3, 3]\n  - This allows me to have 2 units from item 4 and 2 units from item 5.\n\nLet's calculate my counteroffer value for me:\n- Item 3: 1 unit * 58 value = 58\n- Item 4: 2 units * 58 value = 116\n- Item 5: 2 units * 12 value = 24\n- Total value = 58 + 116 + 24 = 198\n\nThis modified offer keeps the total below 394.

Compare with my outside offer value:**\nMy outside offer is 630.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\nThe current offer yields 302.4 value for me, which is significantly less than my outside offer value of 630. In this case, accepting the current offer would not be favorable.\n\n**4. Consider making a counteroffer:**\n\nLet's make a counteroffer that maximizes the value I get, hopefully enough to be more than 630 when considering the discount rate in later rounds, or pushes Player 2 closer to my terms:\n\nPreviously, I offered [0, 3, 3, 2, 0]. Let's adjust the offer to:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nThis would mean I propose keeping more of the valuable items based on my own valuation:\n\nMy allocation would become:\n- Item 1: 2 units\n- Item 2: 3 units\n- Item 3: 2 units\n- Item 4: 3 units\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nCalculate the value for my potential allocation:\n- Value from 2 units of item 1: 2 * 95 = 190\n- Value from 3 units of item 2: 3 * 39 = 117\n- Value from 2 units of item 3: 2 * 19 = 38\n- Value from 3 units of item 4: 3 * 48 = 144\n- Value from 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 81 = 81\n\nTotal allocation value: 190 + 117 + 38 + 144 + 81 = 570\n\nWith discount for round 3 (gamma^2 = 0.81), potential value: 570 * 0.81 = 461.7\n\nThis still isn't as much as my outside offer of 630, but it puts more pressure on Player 2.\n\n**5.

                    "response": "To decide on the appropriate action, I need to evaluate my total value for the items and consider my outside offer value. Then, I'll make an offer that maximizes my potential gain while considering the potential response from Player 2.\n\nHere's the breakdown of my private values for each item:\n- Item 1: 5 units, value per unit = 58, total value = 5 * 58 = 290\n- Item 2: 6 units, value per unit = 88, total value = 6 * 88 = 528\n- Item 3: 3 units, value per unit = 72, total value = 3 * 72 = 216\n- Item 4: 4 units, value per unit = 47, total value = 4 * 47 = 188\n- Item 5: 1 unit, value per unit = 69, total value = 1 * 69 = 69\n\nMy total value for all items is 1291. However, my outside offer value is 1042, which means that in order to justify accepting a deal instead of my outside option, I need an allocation of items whose discounted value (considering the round number discount) exceeds 1042.\n\nSince we're at the starting round (round 1), the discount factor doesn't apply yet (1^0 = 1), so immediate values are considered. At a basic level, I should aim for an offer that has a value of over 1042 for me while leaving room for potential acceptance on Player 2's end.\n\nGiven the situation, an equitable and strategic initial offer might try to test Player 2's threshold while still maintaining the highest possible value for myself. I'll attempt to propose an offer in which Player 2 receives items I value less but still maintains fairness.\n\nProposed counteroffer:\n- Item 1: 2 units to Player 2 (290 total value shared)\n- Item 2: 3 units to Player 2 (528 total value shared)\n- Item 3: 1 unit to Player 2 (216 total value shared)\n- Item 4: 2 units to Player 2 (188 total value shared)\n- Item 5: 0 units to Player 2 (69 total value shared)\n\nThis means my counteroffer to Player 2 will provide:\n- Item 1: 2 units (2 * 58 = 116)\n- Item 2: 3 units (3 * 88 = 264)\n- Item 3: 1 unit (1 * 72 = 72)\n- Item 4: 2 units (2 * 47 = 94)\n- Item 5: 0 units (0 * 69 = 0)\n\nTotal value to Player 2 (from my perspective): 116 + 264 + 72 + 94 + 0 = 546 value to Player 2\n\nAnd I would receive 1291 - 546 = 745 value, which does not exceed the outside offer. However, I am unclear about Player 2's values and acceptability, so I must revise to ensure my values personally exceed 1042. Hence, an initial disproportional offer testing Player 2's values might be more beneficial.\n\nRevised Counteroffer:\n- Item 1: 1 unit to Player 2\n- Item 2: 2 units to Player 2\n- Item 3: 0 units to Player 2\n- Item 4: 1 unit to Player 2\n- Item 5: 0 units to Player 2\n\nTotal player 1 receivable value:\n- Item 1: 4 units (4 * 58)\n- Item 2: 4 units (4 * 88)\n- Item 3: 3 units (3 * 72)\n- Item 4: 3 units (3 * 47)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (1 * 69)\n\nCalculating my value, excluding Player 2's portion proposed:\n- Value1 = 232\n- Value2 = 352\n- Value3 = 216\n- Value4 = 141\n- Value5 = 69\nTotal: 1010 (not sufficient in exceeding 1042)\n\nRevised again for sufficiency:\n- Maintain higher self-receipt of unit items via different configuration:\n- Test lower:\n   Offer:\n  - Item 1: 1\n  - Item 2: 1\n  - Item 3: 0\n  - Item 4: 1\n  - Item 5: 0\n\nReceiving:\n - Value1 = 4*58=232\n - Value2 = 5*88=440\n - Value3 = 3*72=216\n - Value4 = 3*47=141\n - Value5 = 1*69=69\n=Total 1098 (exceeds!)\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]}",

I must receive items worth more than 827.78 after the first round to beat the gradual discounting impact.\n\n### Calculation:\n\n- **Offering**:  \n  - Most valuable to me: Item 1.\n  - Less critical: Item 2, Item 3, Item 4, Item 5.\n  \nGiven this thinking, I should propose keeping a majority of Item 1 for myself and offering significant portions of other items.\n\n- Offer Plan:\n  - \\(Item 1: 2\\) (offer 4 to Player 2)\n  - \\(Item 2: 3\\) (offer 1 to Player 2)\n  - \\(Item 3: 2\\) (offer 2 to Player 2)\n  - \\(Item 4: 1\\) (offer 2 to Player 2)\n  - \\(Item 5: 0\\) (offer 1 to Player 2)\n\nHypothetical retained value without discount:\n- \\(100 \\times 2) + (33 \\times 3) + (59 \\times 2) + (48 \\times 1) + (49 \\times 0) = 200 + 99 + 118 + 48 + 0 = 465\\).\n\nFinal calculation shows I miss the desirable threshold. My initial assumption does not hold well. Let's focus on reallocating items\u2014better to reduce less prioritized items more and keep high value ones:\n\nRetaining more item 1s:\n\n- **Modified Offer**:\n  - Offer 3 units of item 1 (retain for better value)\n  - Offer 3 units of items 2,3,4 (to enhance offer)\n  - Offer 1 unit of item 5 (small advantage)\n\nRetained value:\n- Now proposed offer accounts: 3 of item 1, giving me more units, showcasing considerable value maintenance with slight compromises on lesser-value items.\n\nRevised Offer:\n- \\(Item 1: 3\\) (offer 3)\n- \\(Item 2: 3\\) (offer 1)\n- \\(Item 3: 3\\) (offer 1)\n- \\(Item 4: 2\\) (offer 0)\n- \\(Item 5: 0\\) (offer 1)\n\nThe retained value calculation exceeds the discounted acceptance goal after adjustments.\n\n### Action:\n\nSince realistic initial attempts didn't work strictly and after softening concessions, I propose maintaining high-profit parts, commuting offers on others.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

The strategy involves keeping high-value items while offering balanced allocations to Player 2.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of all items to me:\n\n- Total value of Item 1: 9 * 33 = 297\n- Total value of Item 2: 10 * 33 = 330\n- Total value of Item 3: 5 * 14 = 70\n- Total value of Item 4: 5 * 40 = 200\n- Total value of Item 5: 6 * 17 = 102\n\nThe total maximum value I can receive is 999, which is calculated as the sum of the above values.\n\nNow, I need to create an initial offer. As this is a first proposal and there's no current offer from Player 2, I\u2019ll try to ensure that even if Player 2 values items differently, they should see some merit in my offer. \n\nTo achieve this, I'll give more units of lower-value items and retain more units of higher-value items for myself.

A fair split should give me a value greater than my outside offer.\n\n### Preparing a Counteroffer\n\nTo ensure that my offer remains attractive to Player 1 but beneficial for me, I need to reallocate some items:\n\n- I have initially taken more of items with higher value for me (items 3, 4, and 5).\n- I will give Player 1 an increased amount of lower priority items for me (like item 2) and decrease others:\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal:**\n- [0, 3, 0, 4, 1]: Player 1 - 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n- Leaving me with:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \n  - Item 2: 2 units\n  - Item 3: 1 unit\n  - Item 4: 2 units\n  - Item 5: 1 unit\n\n**My New Value Calculation if Accepted:**\n- Item 1: 1 unit * 71 = 71\n- Item 2: 2 units * 37 = 74\n- Item 3: 1 unit * 78 = 78\n- Item 4: 2 units * 94 = 188\n- Item 5: 1 unit * 78 = 78\n\n**Total Value of the Counteroffer for Me:** 71 + 74 + 78 + 188 + 78 = 489\n\nThis counteroffer still doesn't reach my outside value but increases from my current offer. Given the dynamics, this could open a negotiation line.\n\n### Decision\n\nBased on the evaluation:\n- Since the counteroffer gives me a better return than the current offer, and we are in round 1, I will propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 4, 1]}\n```",

My value is 71 per unit, so 1 * 71 = 71.\n- Item 2: 5 - 3 = 2 units for me. My value is 37 per unit, so 2 * 37 = 74.\n- Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1 unit for me. My value is 78 per unit, so 1 * 78 = 78.\n- Item 4: 6 - 3 = 3 units for me. My value is 94 per unit, so 3 * 94 = 282.\n- Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1 unit for me.
