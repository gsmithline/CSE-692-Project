Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 768. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 768. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 987 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 0 + 72 x 2 + 69 x 2 + 97 x 5 + 9 x 0\n    which is 767 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 768. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 330. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 780 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 0 + 49 x 0 + 24 x 3 + 13 x 2 + 77 x 3\n    which is 329 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 330. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

This suggests that the other player might value item 1, 2, and 4.\n\nLet's try to make a counteroffer that increases the value of item 1, 2, 4 for the other player, while maximizing my own value. I can offer [2, 0, 2, 2, 0] to the other player.\n\nThis means I keep:\n* Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3\n* Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3\n* Item 3: 6 - 2 = 4\n* Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n* Item 5: 3 - 0 = 3\n\nMy value:\n*   3 units of item 1: 3 * 97 = 291\n*   3 units of item 2: 3 * 49 = 147\n*   4 units of item 3: 4 * 24 = 96\n*   3 units of item 4: 3 * 13 = 39\n*   3 units of item 5: 3 * 77 = 231\n*   Total Value = 291 + 147 + 96 + 39 + 231 = 804\n\nThe present value of this outcome in round 2 is 804 * 0.9 = 723.6.\n\n3) **Decision:**\nSince the present value of the current offer (372.6) is greater than my outside offer (330), and I believe that I can make a counteroffer that is even more beneficial, I will propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 2, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "My analysis is as follows:\n\n1. My guaranteed outside offer is worth 768 (undiscounted). Because we are now in round 3, any deal we make will have its value discounted by a factor of 0.9^(3\u20131) = 0.81. Thus any deal I agree to must, when my kept item\u2010value is multiplied by 0.81, yield more than 768. In other words, I need my kept allocation\u2019s undiscounted value to be at least about 768/0.81 \u2248 949.\n\n2. My private per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 82\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 72\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 69\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 97\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 9\n\u2003\u2003The full item pool is: 5, 3, 6, 5, 3 respectively.\n\n3. The current offer on the table (from Player 2) gives me [2,0,2,2,0]. Calculating my value if I were to accept:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2\u00d782 = 164\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 0\u00d772 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2\u00d769 = 138\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 2\u00d797 = 194\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 0\u00d79 = 0\n\u2003\u2003Total = 496; discounting by 0.81 gives about 496\u00d70.81 \u2248 401.8, which is far below the 768 I\u2019d get by walking away. So accepting is not acceptable.\n\n4. To improve on my outside offer I must counter with a proposal whereby the items I keep (undiscounted) are worth at least roughly 949. In earlier rounds I proposed an offer of [1,1,1,1,3] (which would deliver me a kept allocation of [4,2,5,4,0] with a value of 1205), but that offer was rejected. Learning from the history and also noting that Player 2\u2019s own proposals (e.g. offering me [2,0,2,2,0]) suggest that they might be expecting to get more of the high\u2010value items (for me, items 1 and 4 are very valuable), I decide to concede a bit more on those items so that the deal is appealing to them without sacrificing too much of my own value.\n\n5. I then consider a split where I keep almost all of my most valuable items yet \u201csweeten\u201d the deal by giving opponent a nontrivial share. I propose keeping:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 4 (thus giving opponent 1 unit)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 2 (opponent gets 1)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3 (opponent gets 3)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 4 (opponent gets 1)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 0 (opponent gets all 3)\n\u2003\u2003This means I keep a total undiscounted value of:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 4\u00d782 = 328\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 2\u00d772 = 144\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 3\u00d769 = 207\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 4\u00d797 = 388\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 0\u00d79 = 0\n\u2003\u2003Sum = 328+144+207+388 = 1067\n\u2003\u2003Discounted value in round 3: 1067\u00d70.81 \u2248 863, which is above my fallback of 768.\n\u2003\u2003The offer to Player 2 (i.e. what I give to them) is then the complement:\n\u2003\u2003[Total \u2013 Kept] = [5\u20134, 3\u20132, 6\u20133, 5\u20134, 3\u20130] = [1, 1, 3, 1, 3].\n\n6. This counteroffer improves on my previous round\u2019s offer by giving Player 2 a bit more of the items (including one unit each of items 1, 2, and 4\u2014items that my opponent might value highly\u2014and the full concession on item 5 which is least valuable for me). It avoids the five mistakes (I\u2019m not proposing a deal that leaves me with less than my outside offer, nor am I repeating a poorer offer for me) and balances incentives in a final round scenario.\n\nThus, my action is to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1,1,3,1,3]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 0 + 49 x 0 + 24 x 3 + 13 x 2 + 77 x 3\n    which is 329 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 330. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 2, 2, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now. For instance, an offer worth 224 in round 1 is worth 224*0.9 = 201.6 in round 2, and 224 * 0.9^2 = 181.44 in round 3.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 4. My value for this offer is: (1 * 22) + (0 * 32) + (0 * 71) + (1 * 49) + (0 * 23) = 22 + 49 = 71.\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** 71 is much less than my outside offer of 224.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is much worse than my outside offer, I should not accept it. I also need to avoid offering them an offer that gives me less than my outside offer value. I'll start by calculating the value of giving them all of certain items, like all the items I don't value highly.\nI need to construct a counteroffer that benefits me more than my outside option. Since player 1 offered a small amount of items, they must value the others.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 a counteroffer of: [4, 1, 0, 4, 1]. This would leave me with:\nItem 1: 5 - 4 = 1\nItem 2: 2 - 1 = 1\nItem 3: 0 - 0 = 0\nItem 4: 5 - 4 = 1\nItem 5: 2 - 1 = 1\nMy value for this offer is (1 * 22) + (1 * 32) + (0 * 71) + (1 * 49) + (1 * 23) = 22 + 32 + 49 + 23 = 126\n\nStill not enough. I need to give up less items, or offer them items that I don't value very much.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 a counteroffer of: [2, 0, 0, 2, 0]. This would leave me with:\nItem 1: 5 - 2 = 3\nItem 2: 2 - 0 = 2\nItem 3: 0 - 0 = 0\nItem 4: 5 - 2 = 3\nItem 5: 2 - 0 = 2\nMy value for this offer is (3 * 22) + (2 * 32) + (0 * 71) + (3 * 49) + (2 * 23) = 66 + 64 + 147 + 46 = 323\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer, so I'll make this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 17. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 2 + 88 x 0 + 94 x 0 + 41 x 0 + 37 x 0\n    which is 12 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 17. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 176\n   - My values for items 1-5: 93, 43, 29, 34, 11\n   - Total pool of items: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.  This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times its face value. Waiting reduces the value, so I want to accept a good offer earlier rather than later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. My value for this offer is (0 * 93) + (1 * 43) + (0 * 29) + (0 * 34) + (0 * 11) = 43. This is *much* lower than my outside offer of 176.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 176. Let's consider some options:\n      - Keeping all the item 1: (3 * 93) = 279 > 176. If I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], my value is 279 + 43 + 87 + 136 + 22 = 567. I'm better off making a counteroffer as long as it's advantageous.\n      - Let's calculate the value to me of keeping [3, 0, 3, 4, 2]: 3*93 + 0*43 + 3*29 + 4*34 + 2*11 = 279 + 0 + 87 + 136 + 22 = 524\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:**  The current offer is terrible compared to my outside offer. I definitely shouldn't accept it. I need to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I should *not* accept the current offer.\n   - I should *not* walk away.\n   - I should make a counteroffer.\n\nLet's aim for a value above my outside offer and make a reasonable offer to Player 1. I should make a counteroffer that captures a decent share of the total value but still leaves Player 1 with something. Let's test a counteroffer of giving Player 1 all of item 2 and all of item 5. This means I keep [3, 0, 3, 4, 0].\n\nMy value would be (3 * 93) + (0 * 43) + (3 * 29) + (4 * 34) + (0 * 11) = 279 + 0 + 87 + 136 + 0 = 502. This is a significant improvement. It's much higher than my outside offer, meaning the negotiation is worth pursuing. It also seems like a reasonable amount to keep for myself given all the available items.\n\nTherefore, the counteroffer should be [0, 1, 0, 0, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 631. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 651 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 3, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 2 + 1 x 1 + 84 x 3 + 47 x 4 + 45 x 2\n    which is 611 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 631. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 3, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 0 + 58 x 4 + 11 x 3 + 37 x 2 + 34 x 1\n    which is 373 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 374. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 2, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** 855\n*   **Item Values:** Item 1: 46, Item 2: 93, Item 3: 77, Item 4: 20, Item 5: 99\n*   **Total Item Pool:** Item 1: 6, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 6, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means an agreement in round 3 is worth 90% of an agreement in round 2.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [6, 0, 3, 0, 0]. This means I get 6 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value for this offer is:\n    (6 * 46) + (0 * 93) + (3 * 77) + (0 * 20) + (0 * 99) = 276 + 0 + 231 + 0 + 0 = 507\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** 507 < 855. Accepting the current offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\n*   **Counteroffer Considerations:** I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 855. I want to keep items I value highly (2, 3, and 5) and give away items I value less (1 and 4).\n    Since Player 1 offered me all 6 units of item 1, it's possible they don't value it highly. They offered none of item 5, so maybe they value item 5 highly. They offered 3 of item 3, maybe they don't care about it.\n    In the last round, I offered them all items of item 1 and none of all other items.\n\n    Let's try to come up with a counteroffer, keeping in mind the quantities of each item. I have the following total values for each item:\n    Item 1: 6 * 46 = 276\n    Item 2: 6 * 93 = 558\n    Item 3: 3 * 77 = 231\n    Item 4: 6 * 20 = 120\n    Item 5: 5 * 99 = 495\n    Total value = 1680\n\n    I want to keep enough items that the value of my allocation is greater than 855.\n\n    I'll construct a few examples for my own value calculation:\n    - **Example 1:** Keep all item 2 and all item 5, all item 3, none of the others:\n    6 * 93 + 5 * 99 + 3 * 77 = 558 + 495 + 231 = 1284. This could work. I would offer [6, 0, 0, 6, 0].\n    - **Example 2:** Keep 5 item 2 and 4 item 5, all item 3, none of the others:\n    5 * 93 + 4 * 99 + 3 * 77 = 465 + 396 + 231 = 1092. This could work. I would offer [6, 1, 0, 6, 1].\n    - **Example 3:** Keep 3 item 2 and 3 item 5, all item 3, none of the others:\n    3 * 93 + 3 * 99 + 3 * 77 = 279 + 297 + 231 = 807. This doesn't work.\n\n    Since this is round 2, I will offer a counteroffer that I'm happy with and hope it works. To give myself the best possible outcome, I'm going to offer [6, 0, 0, 6, 0]. This means I keep 6 of Item 2, 3 of item 3 and 5 of item 5 which gives me a value of 1284.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 0, 0, 6, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 0 + 93 x 3 + 77 x 0 + 20 x 4 + 99 x 5\n    which is 854 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 855. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 2, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [6, 0, 3, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [6, 0, 0, 6, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [6, 0, 3, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [6, 0, 3, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 0 + 81 x 0 + 64 x 0 + 59 x 1 + 20 x 5\n    which is 159 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 160. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 220.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 23, item 2 = 59, item 3 = 3, item 4 = 37, item 5 = 10.\n   - The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth 90% of the same offer in the current round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 1, 2, 2]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n      - Value of current offer: (0 * 23) + (0 * 59) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 37) + (2 * 10) = 0 + 0 + 3 + 74 + 20 = 97.\n      - Since 97 < 220 (my outside offer), accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to construct a counteroffer that gives Player 1 some items but also leaves me with a value greater than 220. Let's consider several options and calculate their values:\n\n     - Keep all of Item 2 (3 units * 59 = 177), and Item 4 (5 units * 37 = 185) that already exceeds my outside offer and it leaves item 1, 3, and 5 open for negotiation.\n     - *Offer 1: [2, 0, 3, 5, 5]* (Offer all of items 1, 3, 4, and 5). I keep all units of item 2. My value: 3 * 59 = 177. This is lower than my outside offer. Not viable.\n     - *Offer 2: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]* (Offer all of items 1, 3, 4, and 5 *except* item 4). I keep all units of item 2, 3, 4, and 5. My value: 3 * 59 + 3 * 3 + 5 * 37 + 5 * 10 = 177 + 9 + 185 + 50 = 421. This is greater than my outside offer.\n     - *Offer 3: [2, 0, 3, 0, 0]* (Offer all of items 1, 3, and 4, 5 *except* item 4). I keep all units of item 2 and 4,5. My value: 3 * 59 + 5 * 37 + 5 * 10 = 177 + 185 + 50 = 412. This is greater than my outside offer.\n     - *Offer 4: [2, 0, 3, 5, 0]* (Offer all of items 1, 3, and 5 ). I keep all units of item 2 and 4. My value: 3 * 59 + 5 * 37 = 177 + 185 = 362. This is greater than my outside offer.\n     - *Offer 5: [2, 0, 0, 5, 5]* (Offer all of items 1 and 3.). I keep all units of item 2,3, and 4. My value: 3 * 59 + 3*3 + 5*37 + 5*10 = 177 + 9 +185 + 50 = 421\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is not an option as it's less than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away is also not an option at this stage, as it's only round 1.\n   - I'll propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 5, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 3 + 76 x 0 + 94 x 5 + 63 x 6 + 23 x 2\n    which is 1095 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1096. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 0 + 44 x 0 + 1 x 4 + 44 x 5 + 65 x 2\n    which is 354 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 355. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 5, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1.  **Current Situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value: 355\n    *   My values per item: item 1 = 62, item 2 = 44, item 3 = 1, item 4 = 44, item 5 = 65\n    *   Total items: item 1 = 3, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 5, item 4 = 7, item 5 = 3\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 of its face value, compared to the value if accepted now.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   **Current Offer:** I am being offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 3].  This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. My value is (0 * 62) + (0 * 44) + (0 * 1) + (0 * 44) + (3 * 65) = 195.\n    *   Since 195 < 355, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\n    *   **Consider the previous round:** I offered Player 1 [3, 2, 5, 0, 0]. This means I would have kept 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 7 of item 4 and 3 of item 5.  My value for that division would have been (0 * 62) + (0 * 44) + (0 * 1) + (7 * 44) + (3 * 65) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 308 + 195 = 503.\n\n    *  **What happens if I keep [0, 0, 0, 7, 3]?** My value will be 503. If I accept the current offer, it will be worth 195. If I walk away I will get 355. Therefore I need to consider a counter offer to get the best outcome.\n\n    *   **What happens if I walk away?** My value is 355.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer Considerations:** I need to make a counteroffer that is worth more than 355. Player 1 values of the items are unknown. It is round 2, if I give a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer and the other player accepts, I have a good outcome.\n    *   I value items 1, 2, 4, and 5 higher than item 3. Player 1 offered me all 3 of item 5, which suggests that they don't value them as highly as I do. Player 1 also offered me all of item 3.\n    *   I offered player 1 all of item 1, item 2 and item 3. This means that I kept all of item 4 and item 5.\n\n3.  **Decision:**\n\n    The current offer is worse than my outside offer, so I will not accept. I will make a counteroffer. I will counteroffer by requesting more of item 4. In return, I will give Player 1 items that I don't value as much and Player 1 gave me.\n    I will offer the other player [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]. This means I keep 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 7 of item 4 and 3 of item 5.\n    My value is (3 * 62) + (2 * 44) + (2 * 1) + (7 * 44) + (3 * 65) = 186 + 88 + 2 + 308 + 195 = 779.\n    Since 779 > 355, this is a valid counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 5, 5, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 2 + 40 x 5 + 61 x 5 + 10 x 2 + 96 x 6\n    which is 1225 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1231. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1231.\n   - My item values are: item 1 = 62, item 2 = 40, item 3 = 61, item 4 = 10, item 5 = 96.\n   - Total item pool: 2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 6 of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.  This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and round 3 is worth 81%.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 2, 2, 2].  This means I get:\n      - 0 of item 1\n      - 1 of item 2\n      - 2 of item 3\n      - 2 of item 4\n      - 2 of item 5\n      My value of this offer: (0 * 62) + (1 * 40) + (2 * 61) + (2 * 10) + (2 * 96) = 0 + 40 + 122 + 20 + 192 = 374\n      Since 374 < 1231, accepting this offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to construct an offer that, after what I keep, my total value exceeds 1231. I also need to leave Player 1 with a reasonable offer so they might accept.\n\n   Let's start by keeping everything and then adjusting. Keeping all items yields the following values:\n      - 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 62 = 124\n      - 5 units of item 2 = 5 * 40 = 200\n      - 5 units of item 3 = 5 * 61 = 305\n      - 4 units of item 4 = 4 * 10 = 40\n      - 6 units of item 5 = 6 * 96 = 576\n      Total Value = 124 + 200 + 305 + 40 + 576 = 1245\n\n   This is already slightly above my outside offer. I need to give *something* to the other player. Let's think about what I value *least*, which is item 4 (value = 10). I have 4 of these. Let's offer all 4 item 4 units to Player 1:\n\n   - Keep: 2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 6 of item 5\n   - Offer to Player 1: 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 0 of item 5\n\n   My value: (2 * 62) + (5 * 40) + (5 * 61) + (0 * 10) + (6 * 96) = 124 + 200 + 305 + 0 + 576 = 1205\n   1205 < 1231 so this is still worse than walking away\n\n   Let's try offering 1 of item 3 and 4 of item 4.\n   - Keep: 2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 6 of item 5\n   - Offer: 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 0 of item 5\n   - Value: (2 * 62) + (5 * 40) + (4 * 61) + (0 * 10) + (6 * 96) = 124 + 200 + 244 + 0 + 576 = 1144\n   Still worse. Let's think harder.\n\n   Perhaps item 2 since its value is 40. Let's try offer them two of item 2\n\n   - Keep: 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 6 of item 5\n   - Offer: 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 0 of item 5\n   - Value: (2 * 62) + (3 * 40) + (5 * 61) + (4 * 10) + (6 * 96) = 124 + 120 + 305 + 40 + 576 = 1165\n   Still worse! Let's try an offer that leaves me with a value > 1231\n\n   Let's try giving away one of item 5 (my highest value item to me)\n\n   - Keep: 2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 5 of item 5\n   - Offer: 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 1 of item 5\n   - Value: (2 * 62) + (5 * 40) + (5 * 61) + (4 * 10) + (5 * 96) = 124 + 200 + 305 + 40 + 480 = 1149\n   Still worse than the outside offer.\n\n   Let me offer the other player only the item 4\n\n   -Keep : 2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 6 of item 5\n   -Offer: 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 0 of item 5\n   -Value: (2 * 62) + (5 * 40) + (5 * 61) + (0 * 10) + (6 * 96) = 124 + 200 + 305 + 0 + 576 = 1205\n\n   Still worse!\n\n   Let me try giving up 1 unit of item 3 and 1 unit of item 4\n\n   - Keep: 2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 6 of item 5\n   - Offer: 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 0 of item 5\n   - Value: (2 * 62) + (5 * 40) + (4 * 61) + (3 * 10) + (6 * 96) = 124 + 200 + 244 + 30 + 576 = 1174\n   Still bad.\n\n   If I give the other player 0 items, my value is 1245. So I need to offer small amounts.\n   Let's try offering 1 of item 2, and 1 of item 3, and 1 of item 4\n\n   - Keep: 2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 6 of item 5\n   - Offer: 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 0 of item 5\n   - Value: (2 * 62) + (4 * 40) + (4 * 61) + (3 * 10) + (6 * 96) = 124 + 160 + 244 + 30 + 576 = 1134\n\n   Still worse. To get above my outside offer, I need to keep most of my items.\n   Okay, let's try an offer that gives away ONE of the lowest-valued item, item 4.\n\n   - Keep: 2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 6 of item 5\n   - Offer: 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 0 of item 5\n   - Value: 124 + 200 + 305 + 30 + 576 = 1235.\n\n   This is slightly above my outside offer, so it makes sense to offer this counteroffer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer is terrible (value 374).\n   - Walking away gets me 1231.\n   - My counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] gives me a value of 1235.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its undiscounted value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its undiscounted value.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Current offer: I am being offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n   - Value of current offer: (0 * 62) + (0 * 40) + (0 * 61) + (1 * 10) + (0 * 96) = 10\n   - Discounted value of current offer: 10 * 0.9 = 9. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 1231.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1231, and gives the other player enough to not WALK themselves. Since they are offering so little to me, it suggests they value item 4.\n\n    Let's calculate the value of keeping all items and giving the rest to Player 1. My value would be: (2 * 62) + (5 * 40) + (5 * 61) + (4 * 10) + (6 * 96) = 124 + 200 + 305 + 40 + 576 = 1245.\n\nSince the total value of all items for me is 1245, I can't offer anything to Player 1 that will leave me better off than my outside offer. Since this is round 2, I need to take into account the discount factor if I move to round 3. My outside offer now is worth more than trying to negotiate in round 3.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer is worth far less than my outside offer.\n   - Any offer I make to Player 1, leaving me better off than my outside offer, is not going to be possible.\n   - I should WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 0 + 100 x 0 + 17 x 4 + 46 x 5 + 32 x 4\n    which is 426 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 427. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 4, 2, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 1340\n   - My item values: Item 1 = 81, Item 2 = 44, Item 3 = 53, Item 4 = 73, Item 5 = 30\n   - Total items: Item 1 = 7, Item 2 = 7, Item 3 = 4, Item 4 = 5, Item 5 = 8\n   - Discount factor: 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n   - Value of current offer: (0 * 81) + (0 * 44) + (1 * 53) + (0 * 73) + (0 * 30) = 53\n   - Discounted value of current offer: 53 * 0.9 = 47.7.  This is significantly less than my outside offer of 1340.\n\n3) **Considerations for counteroffers:**\n   - I need to make a counteroffer that provides me with a discounted value greater than 1340 if it is accepted in the current round. This would require calculating the value of what I would keep and what I would offer to Player 1.\n\nLet's consider an offer that gives Player 1 relatively little and I keep the majority of the items:\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]. Then I would keep [7, 5, 4, 5, 8]. My value would then be:\n(7 * 81) + (5 * 44) + (4 * 53) + (5 * 73) + (8 * 30) = 567 + 220 + 212 + 365 + 240 = 1604.\nThe discounted value would be 1604 * 0.9 = 1443.6, which is greater than 1340.\n\nNow let's try offering Player 1 [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. Then I would keep [7, 4, 4, 5, 8]. My value would then be:\n(7 * 81) + (4 * 44) + (4 * 53) + (5 * 73) + (8 * 30) = 567 + 176 + 212 + 365 + 240 = 1560.\nThe discounted value would be 1560 * 0.9 = 1404, which is greater than 1340.\n\nNow let's try offering Player 1 [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]. Then I would keep [7, 3, 4, 5, 8]. My value would then be:\n(7 * 81) + (3 * 44) + (4 * 53) + (5 * 73) + (8 * 30) = 567 + 132 + 212 + 365 + 240 = 1516.\nThe discounted value would be 1516 * 0.9 = 1364.4, which is greater than 1340.\n\nNow let's try offering Player 1 [0, 5, 0, 0, 0]. Then I would keep [7, 2, 4, 5, 8]. My value would then be:\n(7 * 81) + (2 * 44) + (4 * 53) + (5 * 73) + (8 * 30) = 567 + 88 + 212 + 365 + 240 = 1472.\nThe discounted value would be 1472 * 0.9 = 1324.8, which is less than 1340.\n\nSo it looks like offering [0, 4, 0, 0, 0] is the most generous I can be while still being above my outside offer.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe current offer is terrible. I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "My reasoning:\n1. My outside offer is 427 (undiscounted). In this round (round 3) any negotiated outcome will be discounted by \u03b3^(3\u20131)=0.9\u00b2=0.81. That means for any division I get from the negotiation its undiscounted total value (according to my private values) is multiplied by 0.81. To beat my fallback, I need a division whose pre\u2010discount total value is at least 427/0.81\u2248528.\n2. My private values are very high for items 1 (94 per unit) and 2 (100 per unit) while items 3 (17 per unit), 4 (46 per unit), and 5 (32 per unit) are less valuable to me. In a counteroffer I want to keep nearly all of items 1 and (most of) 2 while conceding items I value less.\n3. The current offer on the table is [0, 4, 0, 0, 0] \u2013 meaning I\u2019d get no item\u202f1, 4 of item\u202f2, and nothing else. That gives me 4\u00d7100=400 value (before discount), and once discounted by 0.81 it yields about 324 \u2013 which is below my outside offer of 427.\n4. To both obtain a negotiated deal that improves on my outside offer and also make the offer attractive enough for Player\u202f2 (given their previous emphasis on item 2), I design a counteroffer where I concede a useful bundle to them. I propose to give them enough of my lower\u2010value items while conceding a similar amount of item\u202f2 as in their earlier offers. In this proposal I give up, to Player 2, 4 units of item 2 (matching their earlier offer) plus extra units of items that I value relatively little.\n5. Concretely, if I specify a counteroffer in which I offer Player\u202f2 the following counts:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 0 (I keep all 7, since 94 per unit is high)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 4 (so I keep 3; 3\u00d7100=300)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: all 4 (I don\u2019t lose much as 4\u00d717=68)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 1 unit (concede a little from a total of 5; 1\u00d746=46)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2 units (from 8; 2\u00d732=64)\nThen my retained bundle is:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 7 units \u2192 7\u00d794=658\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 7\u20134=3 units \u2192 3\u00d7100=300\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 4\u20134=0 units \u2192 0\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 5\u20131=4 units \u2192 4\u00d746=184\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 8\u20132=6 units \u2192 6\u00d732=192\nTotal undiscounted value = 658+300+184+192 = 1334. With a discount factor of 0.81, my present value is \u22481079 \u2013 which is far above my fallback of 427.\n6. This counteroffer gives Player 2 a substantially better bundle than the current offer ([0,4,0,0,0]) while ensuring that I secure a very high value for myself. Thus, I choose to make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 4, 1, 2]}",
                    "action": "COUNTEROFFER"

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 7 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 81 for item 1, 44 for item 2, 53 for item 3, 73 for item 4, 30 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1692. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1340. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1340. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 843 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 5, 4, 4, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 5 + 44 x 5 + 53 x 4 + 73 x 4 + 30 x 7\n    which is 1339 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1340. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 4, 2, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 4, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 4, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 828.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 41, item 2 = 82, item 3 = 16, item 4 = 77, item 5 = 47.\n   - The total pool of items is: 5 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 7 of item 4, 6 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I am being offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5. Player 1 would get the remainder. My value for this offer is:\n      (0 * 41) + (0 * 82) + (0 * 16) + (1 * 77) + (1 * 47) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 77 + 47 = 124.\n      Since 124 is much less than my outside offer of 828, I should not accept this offer.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 828. Since item 2 has the highest value for me (82), I should try to keep as much of it as possible. Item 4 also has a high value.\n   - Let's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1: [5, 0, 4, 0, 6]. This means I keep:\n      - Item 1: 5 - 5 = 0\n      - Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3\n      - Item 3: 4 - 4 = 0\n      - Item 4: 7 - 0 = 7\n      - Item 5: 6 - 6 = 0\n      My value would be: (0 * 41) + (3 * 82) + (0 * 16) + (7 * 77) + (0 * 47) = 0 + 246 + 0 + 539 + 0 = 785.\n      This is still less than my outside offer, so I won't propose this.\n    - Consider a different counteroffer where I keep items 2 and 4 entirely, since I value them most highly. I'll offer the other player all the items I value least (1, 3, 5). That would look like:\n      [5, 0, 4, 0, 6].\n      My value: 0 * 41 + 3 * 82 + 0 * 16 + 7 * 77 + 0 * 47 = 0 + 246 + 0 + 539 + 0 = 785.\n\nLet's aim for a value greater than my outside option in this round, given that it is better to secure an agreement now than in later rounds due to the discounting.\n\nI'll try an offer that gives them almost all of item 1 and 5, most of item 3, but keeps more item 4 and all of item 2.\nOffer: [4, 0, 3, 3, 5]\nMy Value: 1 * 41 + 3 * 82 + 1 * 16 + 4 * 77 + 1 * 47 = 41 + 246 + 16 + 308 + 47 = 658\n\nAnother offer: [3, 0, 3, 0, 3]. My value: 2*41 + 3*82 + 1*16 + 7*77 + 3*47 = 82 + 246 + 16 + 539 + 141 = 1024 > 828\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is bad.\n   - I should not walk away.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 3, 0, 3]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1168. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 822 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 4, 7, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 4 + 73 x 3 + 78 x 4 + 38 x 7 + 29 x 5\n    which is 1166 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1168. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

My values for the items are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item1: 39, Item2: 87, Item3: 16, Item4: 75, Item5: 46.\n\u2003The total pool is: 3, 3, 3, 7, 3 units respectively.\n3. Because item3 is my least\u2010valued (16 per unit), I can consider offering all of item3 to the opponent. I also add a small amount of another item (here, 1 unit of item4, valued at 75 for me) to avoid the appearance of \u201coffering nothing\u201d on the higher\u2010valued items. This helps avoid mistake 3 (offering no items).\n4. Under my proposed allocation:\n\u2003\u2013 I offer to Player 2: 0 units of item1, 0 of item2, all 3 units of item3, 1 unit of item4, and 0 of item5.\n\u2003\u2013 This means I keep for myself: item1: 3, item2: 3, item3: 0, item4: (7\u20131)=6, item5: 3.\n5. Now I compute my total value:\n\u2003\u2022 Item1: 3\u00d739 = 117\n\u2003\u2022 Item2: 3\u00d787 = 261\n\u2003\u2022 Item3: 0\u00d716 = 0\n\u2003\u2022 Item4: 6\u00d775 = 450\n\u2003\u2022 Item5: 3\u00d746 = 138\n\u2003Total value = 117 + 261 + 450 + 138 = 966.\n6. This outcome of 966 is well above my fallback of 691, so I avoid mistake 2.\n7. With this offer I keep almost all of my high-value items while giving up items I value less and a small piece of a higher-value category to signal willingness to share. This avoids both offering nothing and locking myself into a worse outcome.\n8.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 6, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 31 x 0 + 18 x 1 + 25 x 6 + 15 x 1\n    which is 183 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 184. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 184.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 5, item 2 = 31, item 3 = 18, item 4 = 25, item 5 = 15.\n   - The total pool of items is: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 0, 3, 1, 0]. This means I would receive:\n      - 0 units of item 1: 0 * 5 = 0\n      - 0 units of item 2: 0 * 31 = 0\n      - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 18 = 54\n      - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 25 = 25\n      - 0 units of item 5: 0 * 15 = 0\n      - Total value = 0 + 0 + 54 + 25 + 0 = 79\n\n   - This current offer is worth 79 to me. Since 79 < 184, accepting this offer would be worse than my outside offer.\n\n   - Now, let's consider a potential counteroffer. I need to keep enough items to make my total value greater than 184.\n\n   - Let's aim for a split that gives me at least half of the total value. Since the total value is 382, I should aim for a counteroffer that gives me more than 184.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is not acceptable since 79 < 184.\n   - I should not walk away yet, since it is only round 1 and I can attempt to get a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n\n   - I will construct a counteroffer that provides more value to me than my outside offer. I want to keep items that I value highly. I highly value item 2 (31 per unit), item 4 (25 per unit).\n\nLet's try to keep all of item 2 and at least half of item 4. Let me keep all of item 2 (3 units), 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5, and the rest to the other player.\nMy offer would be:\n3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5. What I keep is:\n0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n0 * 5 + 3 * 31 + 0 * 18 + 3 * 25 + 1 * 15 = 0 + 93 + 0 + 75 + 15 = 183. This is almost equal to the outside offer, so let me try another one:\n3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\nWhat I keep is:\n0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n0 * 5 + 3 * 31 + 0 * 18 + 4 * 25 + 1 * 15 = 0 + 93 + 0 + 100 + 15 = 208.\n\nSo my counteroffer is: 3, 0, 3, 3, 2\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 3, 3, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 691. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 789 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 7, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 0 + 87 x 1 + 16 x 2 + 75 x 7 + 46 x 1\n    which is 690 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 691. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 3, 3, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 3, 0, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 5, 3, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    64 x 2 + 7 x 0 + 36 x 5 + 68 x 3 + 16 x 8\n    which is 640 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 644. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

This means waiting reduces the value of any deal I make in the future.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 0, 5, 0, 0].

I'll give Player 1 the rest.\n\n*   **Counteroffer:** I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 6, 0, 8]. This means I keep [4, 0, 0, 3, 0].\n    *   Value of keeping: (4 * 64) + (0 * 7) + (0 * 36) + (3 * 68) + (0 * 16) = 256 + 0 + 0 + 204 + 0 = 460\n    *   This is less than my outside offer, so this is a bad offer.\n\nLet's try another counteroffer. I want to keep at least enough items to exceed my outside offer of 644. Let's see what happens if I offer [0, 0, 3, 0, 4] to Player 1.\n* This means I keep [4, 0, 3, 3, 4]\n* The value of keeping these is (4 * 64) + (0 * 7) + (3 * 36) + (3 * 68) + (4 * 16) = 256 + 0 + 108 + 204 + 64 = 632.\n* Still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try another counteroffer. I want to keep more of the high-value items to exceed my outside offer. Let's offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 8] to player 1.\n* This means I keep [4, 0, 6, 3, 0]\n* The value of keeping these is (4 * 64) + (0 * 7) + (6 * 36) + (3 * 68) + (0 * 16) = 256 + 0 + 216 + 204 + 0 = 676.\n* This is greater than my outside offer of 644.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth less than my outside offer, so I will not accept.\nMy counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 8] gives me a value greater than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 8]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 1 + 48 x 0 + 24 x 0 + 86 x 0 + 24 x 0\n    which is 12 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 18. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 4, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 18\n*   My item values: item 1 = 12, item 2 = 48, item 3 = 24, item 4 = 86, item 5 = 24\n*   Total items: 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: [0, 0, 4, 0, 3] (This is what Player 1 is offering to *me*).\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 12) + (0 * 48) + (4 * 24) + (0 * 86) + (3 * 24) = 0 + 0 + 96 + 0 + 72 = 168\n    *   Since 168 > 18, accepting the current offer is better than walking away right now.\n\n*   Consider some potential counteroffers. Since Player 1 seems to value items 3 and 5 (offering all units of those items to me), I should try to keep as much of Items 2 and 4 as possible.\n\n    *Keeping only item 4 (6 units), and item 2 (5 units). My value = (6 * 86) + (5 * 48) = 516 + 240 = 756\n    Then I would offer [3, 0, 4, 0, 3] to player 1.\n    \n    If I offered [3, 5, 4, 6, 3], my value is 0. It is worse than my outside offer. I should not do this.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of 168 is significantly better than my outside offer of 18.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "My reasoning:\n1. My outside offer is 195 (guaranteed, non\u2010discounted), so any deal in round 2 must give me an undiscounted total value that, when multiplied by the round\u2019s discount factor (0.9), exceeds 195. That means I must get at least 195/0.9 \u2248 217 in raw value.\n2. My per\u2010unit values are: item1=99, item2=59, item3=44, item4=79, item5=15, with total items [2,2,2,1,4]. Accepting the current offer [0,2,0,1,0] would give me item2 (2 units) and item4 (1 unit), for a raw value of 2\u00d759+1\u00d779 = 118+79 = 197, which, discounted (197\u00d70.9 \u2248177.3), is below 195. So accepting is not acceptable.\n3. I must propose a counteroffer in which the portion I keep (the total items minus what I offer Player 2) has a raw value of at least 217. Also, I want to concede little on items that I highly value (item1, item2, item4) while potentially offering more of items I value less (item5).\n4. A candidate counteroffer is to give Player 2 the following: [1,1,1,0,2]. Then my share becomes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item1: 2\u20131 = 1 unit (value 99)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item2: 2\u20131 = 1 unit (value 59)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item3: 2\u20131 = 1 unit (value 44)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item4: 1\u20130 = 1 unit (value 79)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item5: 4\u20132 = 2 units (value 30)\nThe raw value of my kept items is 99+59+44+79+30 = 311, and discounted this gives 311\u00d70.9 \u2248 279.9, which is comfortably above 195.\n5. This counteroffer avoids the mistakes (it doesn\u2019t give me less than my outside offer and is not worse than my previous offer), and it gives me a deal with high value while still offering the other side a reasonable share to incentivize acceptance.\n\nThus, my action is to propose the counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 590\n   - My item values: item 1: 23, item 2: 2, item 3: 79, item 4: 14, item 5: 98\n   - Total items: item 1: 2, item 2: 2, item 3: 2, item 4: 1, item 5: 4\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that if we reach a deal in round 3, the value is multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [1, 1, 1, 0, 2] (This is what Player 1 is offering me)\n   - If I accept:\n      - 1 unit of item 1 * 23 = 23\n      - 1 unit of item 2 * 2 = 2\n      - 1 unit of item 3 * 79 = 79\n      - 0 unit of item 4 * 14 = 0\n      - 2 unit of item 5 * 98 = 196\n      - Total value = 23 + 2 + 79 + 0 + 196 = 300\n\n      - This is less than my outside offer of 590.\n   - Consider a counteroffer. I currently have these items: item 1: 2, item 2: 2, item 3: 2, item 4: 1, item 5: 4. The current offer on the table is [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]. This means that If I accept it, Player 1 will have item 1: 1, item 2: 1, item 3: 1, item 4: 1, item 5: 2.\n\n   - Let's try to find an offer better than my outside option. If I offer 0 items to Player 1, my value is 2*23 + 2*2 + 2*79 + 1*14 + 4*98 = 46 + 4 + 158 + 14 + 392 = 614. That is greater than my outside offer of 590.\n\n   - How about this: if I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], I get the full value of the items, which is 614.\n\n   - Let's consider offering player 1 item 2 and item 4, which I value less, so my offer will be [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]. My value becomes 2*23 + 0*2 + 2*79 + 0*14 + 4*98 = 46 + 0 + 158 + 0 + 392 = 596, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n   - Another possibility is to give Player 1 one unit of item 3. So I can offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Then my total value becomes 2*23 + 2*2 + 1*79 + 1*14 + 4*98 = 46 + 4 + 79 + 14 + 392 = 535. This is less than my outside offer value, so that is not an ideal offer for me to propose.\n\n   - Let's try a different counteroffer: I offer Player 1 one unit of Item 1, one unit of Item 2, one unit of Item 3, and zero units of Item 4 and one unit of Item 5, this translates to [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]. Then my total value would be one unit of Item 1, one unit of Item 2, one unit of Item 3, one unit of Item 4, three units of Item 5, which equates to 23 + 2 + 79 + 14 + 3*98 = 23 + 2 + 79 + 14 + 294 = 412.\n\n   - The best option is to make an offer of [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]. My total value will be 596, which is more than my outside option of 590.\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer (300) is worse than my outside offer (590).\n   - So, I should not accept. I should propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside option value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 590. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 648 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 1 + 2 x 1 + 79 x 2 + 14 x 1 + 98 x 4\n    which is 589 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 590. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 31 x 0 + 3 x 0 + 10 x 1 + 99 x 0\n    which is 10 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 12. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 31 x 0 + 3 x 0 + 10 x 1 + 99 x 0\n    which is 10 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 12. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 5, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 0 + 2 x 1 + 65 x 0 + 4 x 0 + 57 x 2\n    which is 116 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 118. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "My outside offer is 118.

However, I must offer Player 2 something (to avoid the mistake of offering nothing) and still guarantee that my retained share is above my safe fallback of 118.\n\nI note that I highly value items 1, 3, and 5. In contrast, item 2 (worth only 2 to me) and item 4 (worth only 4 to me) are lower in value. A reasonable way to create a favorable split is to offer most or all of the low-value items to Player 2 while keeping the high-value items for myself, but including a small concession on item 1 to show willingness to negotiate.\n\nFor example, if I propose to give Player 2:\n\u2003\u2022 1 unit of Item 1,\n\u2003\u2022 all 3 units of Item 2,\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of Item 3,\n\u2003\u2022 1 unit of Item 4,\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of Item 5.\n\nThen my allocation is:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2 units (2\u00d765 = 130)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 0 units (0\u00d72 = 0)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2 units (2\u00d765 = 130)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3 units (3\u00d74 = 12)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 4 units (4\u00d757 = 228)\nfor a total value of 130+0+130+12+228 = 500, which is far above my outside offer of 118.\n\nThis counteroffer avoids the mistakes of asking for an outcome below my fallback and of offering no items, while capturing a huge portion of the total value.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 125. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 459 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n    - My outside offer value is 125.\n    - My item values are: item 1: 82, item 2: 36, item 3: 13, item 4: 21, item 5: 1.\n    - The total pool of items is: item 1: 3, item 2: 3, item 3: 2, item 4: 4, item 5: 4.\n    - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n    - The current offer gives me [1, 3, 0, 1, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    - The value of this offer to me is: (1 * 82) + (3 * 36) + (0 * 13) + (1 * 21) + (0 * 1) = 82 + 108 + 0 + 21 + 0 = 211.\n\n3) **Assess the value of potential counteroffers:**\n    - I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 125. I also want to consider what Player 1 might accept. Since it's round 1, I can start with a somewhat aggressive offer. Let's consider a scenario where I give player 1 0 units of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n\n    - If I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1, that means I keep 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n    - The value to me would be: (3 * 82) + (3 * 36) + (2 * 13) + (4 * 21) + (4 * 1) = 246 + 108 + 26 + 84 + 4 = 468.\n\n    - This is much better than my outside offer of 125.\n\n4) **Decision:**\n    - The current offer of [1, 3, 0, 1, 0] is worth 211 to me, which is greater than my outside offer of 125. However, I think I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n    - I will propose a counteroffer that gives Player 1 very little.\n\n    - Let's analyze another counteroffer:\n     I offer Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 2, 2], meaning I keep [2, 3, 1, 2, 2]\n     Value to me is: (2*82) + (3*36) + (1*13) + (2*21) + (2*1) = 164 + 108 + 13 + 42 + 2 = 329\n    \n    Let's analyze another counteroffer:\n     I offer Player 1 [2, 1, 1, 3, 3], meaning I keep [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n     Value to me is: (1*82) + (2*36) + (1*13) + (1*21) + (1*1) = 82 + 72 + 13 + 21 + 1 = 189. This is better than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try one more, a little more generous for Player 1 to test the waters:\n     I offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 2, 2], meaning I keep [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n     Value to me is: (2*82) + (2*36) + (1*13) + (2*21) + (2*1) = 164 + 72 + 13 + 42 + 2 = 293.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 5, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 0 + 29 x 3 + 51 x 5 + 48 x 3 + 69 x 5\n    which is 831 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 832. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Also, given that it's the first round, there's room to negotiate.\n\nLet's consider a few potential counteroffers, focusing on keeping the items I value most (item 4 and item 1). I want to construct an offer such that my total value is significantly more than my outside offer.

This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 3, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 1 + 31 x 2 + 36 x 3 + 100 x 0 + 18 x 5\n    which is 299 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 300. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1.  **Current Situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value is 300.\n    *   My item values are: item 1 = 39, item 2 = 31, item 3 = 36, item 4 = 100, item 5 = 18.\n    *   Total items: 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an agreement in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times the value of the items.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n    *   Current offer: Player 1 offers me [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get all 3 units of item 1, and zero of the others.\n    *   My value for accepting the current offer: 3 * 39 = 117.\n    *   Comparing to my outside offer: 117 < 300. Therefore, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away *even before considering the discount factor*.\n\n3.  **Consider making a counteroffer**\n\n    Since accepting the current offer is worse than walking away, I should either walk away or make a counteroffer. Let's consider some potential counteroffers, keeping in mind that I want to maximize my value. A key piece of evidence is Player 1 appears to not value item 1 since they are giving away all of their initial holdings from Round 1. Since Round 1, they only give away item 1.\n\n    To make the problem simple, I will choose to keep all of items 4 and 3, which I value highest, and try to see if I can propose some offer with item 1, 2, 5 that is greater than my walkaway offer.\n    Offer 1: Keep all of items 3 and 4 and 2 of item 5, offer all other items (1, 2, and the remaining item 5)\n    Items held = [0, 0, 5, 5, 2]\n    Value = 0 + 0 + (5 * 36) + (5 * 100) + (2 * 18) = 180 + 500 + 36 = 716\n    Offer to P1 = [3, 3, 0, 0, 3]\n    This offer is greater than the outside offer, so it is possible.\n\n    Offer 2: Keep all of items 4, keep 4 of item 3, keep 1 of item 2\n    Items held = [0, 1, 4, 5, 0]\n    Value = 0 + (1 * 31) + (4 * 36) + (5 * 100) + 0 = 31 + 144 + 500 = 675\n    Offer to P1 = [3, 2, 1, 0, 5]\n    This offer is also greater than the outside offer.\n\n    Offer 3: Let's try keeping all of item 4, some of item 3, and some of item 2.\n    Items held = [0, 2, 3, 5, 0]\n    Value = 0 + (2 * 31) + (3 * 36) + (5 * 100) + 0 = 62 + 108 + 500 = 670\n    Offer to P1 = [3, 1, 2, 0, 5]\n    This offer is also greater than the outside offer.\n\n    Since this is round 2, I need to consider the discount factor if the game goes to round 3. If it is a tie in round 3, then a WALK is superior.\n    However, I will make an offer that is advantageous for me.\n\n    The optimal solution will require a more complex calculation to maximize the expected utility given the remaining round. But let's start with a reasonable counteroffer.\n    I will offer Player 1 all of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 of item 4, and all of item 5.\n    This will leave me with: 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n\n4.  **Make a decision:**\n\n    I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 0, 5]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 1 + 26 x 3 + 95 x 3 + 47 x 0 + 10 x 0\n    which is 392 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 393. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value: 393\n    *   My values for items: item 1=29, item 2=26, item 3=95, item 4=47, item 5=10\n    *   Total items: item 1=4, item 2=4, item 3=3, item 4=1, item 5=2\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   **Current Offer:** I am offered [2, 2, 1, 0, 1]. This means Player 1 keeps: item 1=4-2=2, item 2=4-2=2, item 3=3-1=2, item 4=1-0=1, item 5=2-1=1\n\n        My value for accepting the current offer:\n        (2 \\* 29) + (2 \\* 26) + (1 \\* 95) + (0 \\* 47) + (1 \\* 10) = 58 + 52 + 95 + 0 + 10 = 215\n\n    *   **Compare to outside offer:** 215 < 393\n\n    *   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer where my value is higher than 393. Let's start by considering keeping all of item 3 since I value it highly. If I give away 0 of item 3, then I would have all 3. Then if I also keep all 4 of item 1, all 4 of item 2, and all 1 of item 4, and all 2 of item 5.\n\n    My value for keeping all items:\n    (4 * 29) + (4 * 26) + (3 * 95) + (1 * 47) + (2 * 10) = 116 + 104 + 285 + 47 + 20 = 572\n\nSince my total value for all items is 572 and my outside offer is 393, any combination of offers that allow me to secure at least 393 worth of items is better than walking away.

Let's start with the current offer as a base and adjust it to make it more favorable.\n\nThe current offer to me is [2, 2, 1, 0, 1].

This means that I need to keep more items to be in a better position.\n\nWhat happens if I offer Player 1 nothing of Items 3 and 4?\nMy offer is [4, 4, 0, 0, 2]. The value of what I keep is:\n(0 * 29) + (0 * 26) + (3 * 95) + (1 * 47) + (0 * 10) = 0 + 0 + 285 + 47 + 0 = 332\nThis is less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try giving them nothing of item 3 but give them the rest of items 1, 2, 4 and 5\nMy offer is [4, 4, 0, 1, 2]\nThe value of what I keep is:\n(0 * 29) + (0 * 26) + (3 * 95) + (0 * 47) + (0 * 10) = 0 + 0 + 285 + 0 + 0 = 285\nThis is worse than my outside offer.\n\nLet's increase the amount I keep of item 3 by 1 (so keep 2), and decrease the amount I offer for another item.\nMy offer is [4, 4, 0, 0, 1]\nThe value of what I keep is:\n(0 * 29) + (0 * 26) + (3 * 95) + (1 * 47) + (1 * 10) = 0 + 0 + 190 + 47 + 10 = 247\nThis is worse than my outside offer.\n\nHow about if I try to give them just item 1 and 2?\n\nMy offer is [4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\nThe value of what I keep is:\n(0 * 29) + (0 * 26) + (3 * 95) + (1 * 47) + (2 * 10) = 0 + 0 + 285 + 47 + 20 = 352\nStill worse than my outside offer.\n\nLet's offer: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nThe value of what I keep is:\n(3 * 29) + (3 * 26) + (3 * 95) + (1 * 47) + (2 * 10) = 87 + 78 + 285 + 47 + 20 = 517\n\nThis is a much better deal.

Analysis of the Current Situation:\n   - My outside offer is 268.\n   - My private per\u2010unit values are: item1: 44, item2: 23, item3: 75, item4: 40, item5: 43.\n   - Totals available: [4, 4, 3, 1, 2].\n   - The discount factor \u03b3 = 0.9 applies as \u03b3^(round-1). In round 2 any outcome\u2019s raw value is multiplied by 0.9.\n   - The current offer on the table gives me [1,1,0,0,0]. Calculating my value: 1\u00d744 + 1\u00d723 = 67 raw, and after discount 67\u00d70.9 \u2248 60, which is far below my outside offer of 268.\n\n2. Assessing Offers:\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me a very low outcome.\n   - I must propose a counteroffer that\u2014if accepted\u2014yields a raw value exceeding 268/0.9 \u2248 298 to beat my fallback.\n   - My high-value items are item1 (44), item3 (75), and item5 (43). I want to keep as many of these units as possible.\n   - I value item2 (23) relatively low and can concede all 4 units, and item4 (40) is only 1 unit so I can concede that too.\n   - By keeping all of my units of item1, item3, and most of item5, I can achieve a high raw value. For instance:\n     \u2022 If I give P2: [0,4,0,1,0], I would keep [4,0,3,0,2] which is worth 4\u00d744 + 3\u00d775 + 2\u00d743 = 487 raw (discounted to 0.9\u00d7487 \u2248 438), well above 268.\n   - However, offering absolutely nothing from item5 might be seen as overly aggressive. Including a modest concession with 1 unit of item5\u2014i.e. offering [0,4,0,1,1]\u2014still gives me:\n     \u2022 Kept items: item1: 4, item2: 0, item3: 3, item4: 0, item5: 1.\n     \u2022 My raw value becomes 4\u00d744 + 3\u00d775 + 1\u00d743 = 176 + 225 + 43 = 444 (discounted: 0.9\u00d7444 \u2248 400), still much better than 268.\n   - This counteroffer avoids all five mistakes: It is an improvement over my previous offer, yields me a value above my fallback, and is not offering nothing.\n\n3. Decision:\n   - I reject the current offer (worth only \u224860 discounted value) and propose the counteroffer [0,4,0,1,1] to maximize my own outcome while offering minimal yet nonzero concessions.\n   \nThus, my action is to make the counteroffer: {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 1, 1]}.\n*/",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 393\n*   **My values of the items:** Item 1: 29, Item 2: 26, Item 3: 95, Item 4: 47, Item 5: 10\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 4, 0, 1, 1]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My value for this offer is:\n\n    (0 * 29) + (4 * 26) + (0 * 95) + (1 * 47) + (1 * 10) = 0 + 104 + 0 + 47 + 10 = 161\n\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value of accepting this offer now is 161 * (0.9^(2-1)) = 161 * 0.9 = 144.9.\n\n*   **Comparing to outside offer:** The current offer's discounted value of 144.9 is significantly less than my outside offer of 393.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that provides me with a value greater than 393, after applying the discount factor of 0.9. This means the face value of my allocation needs to be at least 393 / 0.9 = 436.67.\n    Let's try to construct an offer that favors me and see if it's better than my outside offer. I highly value item 3 (95).\n\n    Here's a possible counteroffer: I offer Player 1 [4, 0, 0, 1, 2]. This means I keep [0, 4, 3, 0, 0]. My value is:\n    (0 * 29) + (4 * 26) + (3 * 95) + (0 * 47) + (0 * 10) = 0 + 104 + 285 + 0 + 0 = 389.\n    This is less than 436.67.\n\n    Let's try another offer: I offer Player 1 [3, 0, 0, 0, 2]. This means I keep [1, 4, 3, 1, 0]. My value is:\n    (1 * 29) + (4 * 26) + (3 * 95) + (1 * 47) + (0 * 10) = 29 + 104 + 285 + 47 + 0 = 465.\n\n    465 * 0.9 = 418.5 which is better than 393.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is much worse than my outside offer. A counteroffer of [3, 0, 0, 0, 2] results in a value higher than my outside offer, even after discounting.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 268. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    44 x 3 + 23 x 4 + 75 x 0 + 40 x 0 + 43 x 1\n    which is 267 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 268. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 90. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 474 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.

This means I keep [2, 3, 0, 5, 4].\n   - Value of current offer to me: (2 * 53) + (3 * 94) + (0 * 31) + (5 * 11) + (4 * 31) = 106 + 282 + 0 + 55 + 124 = 567\n   - How it compares to my outside offer: 567 > 435.  So the current offer is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer is good. However, it is Round 1. I can explore counteroffers to see if I can get an even better deal. Since the current offer gives me a value of 567 and my maximum possible value is (2 * 53) + (4 * 94) + (4 * 31) + (7 * 11) + (6 * 31) = 106 + 376 + 124 + 77 + 186 = 869, there is room to improve.\n\nLet's create a counteroffer. I want to keep the items I value most highly. I really value item 2. Maybe Player 1 doesn't value Item 2 so highly. I will make an offer that gives Player 1 the 2 units of item 1, all 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. This gives Player 1 [2, 0, 4, 4, 4]\n\nMy keeping this offer gives me [0, 4, 0, 3, 2]. This would be valued at:\n0 * 53 + 4 * 94 + 0 * 31 + 3 * 11 + 2 * 31 = 0 + 376 + 0 + 33 + 62 = 471.\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 435.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 4, 4, 4]}\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 526. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 526. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 861 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    69 x 0 + 75 x 1 + 4 x 1 + 84 x 4 + 55 x 2\n    which is 525 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 526. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If it is impossible, then my only rational choice is to WALK.\nLet's start by trying to keep all items for myself:\n5 \\* 29 + 6 \\* 45 + 3 \\* 49 + 4 \\* 87 + 2 \\* 44 = 145 + 270 + 147 + 348 + 88 = 998\nSince my total valuation of all the items is 998, I can construct counteroffers worth more than 634.\nTo prevent mistake 3, I should not offer no or all items.\nLet's try offering the other player 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\nThis means I would have 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n3 \\* 29 + 4 \\* 45 + 2 \\* 49 + 3 \\* 87 + 1 \\* 44 = 87 + 180 + 98 + 261 + 44 = 670\nThis is better than my outside offer of 634.\n\n5) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept.\nI should not walk, since there are counteroffers that would give me a better payoff than my outside offer.\nI will propose a counteroffer of [2, 2, 1, 1, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 634\n*   **My values per unit:** Item 1: 29, Item 2: 45, Item 3: 49, Item 4: 87, Item 5: 44\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n    *   My value if I accept: (1 \\* 29) + (2 \\* 45) + (1 \\* 49) + (0 \\* 87) + (1 \\* 44) = 29 + 90 + 49 + 0 + 44 = 212\n    *   Discounted value: 212 \\* 0.9 = 190.8\n\nThis value is less than my outside offer, so accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\nNow, let's consider some potential counteroffers. The goal is to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 634, taking into account the discount factor. I need to keep enough items for myself.\n\nTo avoid Mistake 2 (offering something worse than my outside offer), I need to calculate how many items to keep.\nLet's consider keeping all of item 4, since it has the highest value per unit (87). If I keep all 4 units, the value is 4 * 87 = 348.\nNow I need another 634 - 348 = 286 value.\nIf I keep all 3 units of item 3: 3 * 49 = 147.\nNow I need another 286 - 147 = 139 value.\nI can keep 2 units of Item 2: 2 * 45 = 90\nNow I need another 139 - 90 = 49 value.\nI can keep all 5 units of item 1 and I get 5*29 = 145 which is greater than 49. Therefore, keeping all 5 item 1 units should result in a valuable offer.\nWith the above, my kept item numbers are [5, 2, 3, 4, x].\nLet us try a more balanced approach:\n\nI am currently in round 2. If I make a counteroffer, this will result in the end of the bargaining game if Player 1 does not accept it. So it is equivalent to walking away. Therefore, I have to provide an optimal counteroffer at this stage.\nTo find a better offer I should give item(s) with lower value to Player 1.\n\nLet's try to create an offer that provides me with value >= 634/0.9 = 704.44\n\nAssume I keep everything from Item 4 (4 * 87 = 348)\nAssume I keep everything from Item 3 (3 * 49 = 147)\nSo far I have a value of 348 + 147 = 495.\nI need 704.44 - 495 = 209.44 value.\nThe next best value is Item 2, I can try keep 5 of them. So I give 1 to Player 1. (5 * 45 = 225 > 209.44)\nNow I give player 1 one unit of Item 2.\nRemaining Value = 495 + 225 = 720 > 704.44\n\nThis gives me a proposed offer of [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of [1, 2, 1, 0, 1] is worth 190.8 to me after discounting, which is less than my outside offer of 634.\nThe offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] will allow me to have at least 720 with discount, which is better than my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 634. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 762 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 3, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 0 + 45 x 5 + 49 x 3 + 87 x 3 + 44 x 0\n    which is 633 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 634. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

This means accepting an offer later is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 3, 3, 0, 2]. This means I get:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 65 = 0\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 16 = 48\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 2 = 6\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 90 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 33 = 66\n    *   Total value: 0 + 48 + 6 + 0 + 66 = 120\n\n    Since 120 is less than my outside offer of 132, accepting this offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to make sure any counteroffer I make keeps me above 132.\n    I currently possess: item 1: 4, item 2: 4, item 3: 4, item 4: 1, item 5: 2\n\n    Let's try to construct a counteroffer that is beneficial to me:\n\n    *   Keep all item 4. 1 * 90 = 90\n    *   Keep all item 1. 4 * 65 = 260\n    *   Give away all items 2 and 3.\n    *   Give away 2 units of item 5 and keep 2. 2 * 33 = 66.\n    * Total value = 260 + 0 + 0 + 90 + 66 = 416\n\n    Let's try something where I only keep items I value and offer the rest.\n\n    *   Offer Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   4 units of item 1: 4 * 65 = 260\n    *   7 units of item 2: 7 * 16 = 112\n    *   7 units of item 3: 7 * 2 = 14\n    *   1 units of item 4: 1 * 90 = 90\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 33 = 132\n    *   Total value: 260 + 112 + 14 + 90 + 132 = 608\n\n    The goal is to determine a fair split of the items where I obtain more than my outside offer. Because Player 1 offered me a value that is less than my outside offer, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n    Here's a counteroffer: I give the other player one unit each of the items 2, 3 and 5, and all of item 1, while I keep all of item 4.\n    I offer [4, 1, 1, 0, 1].\n    I receive:\n    Item 1: 0 * 65 = 0\n    Item 2: 6 * 16 = 96\n    Item 3: 6 * 2 = 12\n    Item 4: 1 * 90 = 90\n    Item 5: 3 * 33 = 99\n    Total: 0 + 96 + 12 + 90 + 99 = 297 > 132\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer, so I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 159. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 159. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 690 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 0 + 47 x 0 + 47 x 1 + 19 x 0 + 24 x 4\n    which is 143 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 159. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Analysis of the current situation:**\n    - My outside offer value is 573.\n    - My values for the items are: item 1 = 40, item 2 = 10, item 3 = 47, item 4 = 47, item 5 = 48.\n    - Total items: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n    - The discount factor is 0.9. This means accepting an offer later will result in a lower value (e.g., accepting in round 2 means the value is multiplied by 0.9, and in round 3 by 0.9^2 = 0.81).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n    - Current offer: [0, 2, 2, 0, 1] (what is offered to me). This means I keep:\n        - Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n        - Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n        - Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n        - Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n        - Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    - Value of current offer to me: (4 * 40) + (2 * 10) + (3 * 47) + (4 * 47) + (2 * 48) = 160 + 20 + 141 + 188 + 96 = 605.\n    - 605 > 573 (my outside offer). So accepting now is better than walking away *if* I don't think I can get a much better deal later.\n\n    - Consider a potential counteroffer. I need to offer something to Player 1. Let's start by thinking about what I value least (item 2) and most (item 5).\n    - Example counteroffer: I offer Player 1 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5. [2, 2, 3, 2, 1]. What would I keep?\n        - Item 1: 4-2 = 2 units\n        - Item 2: 4-2 = 2 units\n        - Item 3: 5-3 = 2 units\n        - Item 4: 4-2 = 2 units\n        - Item 5: 3-1 = 2 units\n    - Value of this counteroffer to me: (2 * 40) + (2 * 10) + (2 * 47) + (2 * 47) + (2 * 48) = 80 + 20 + 94 + 94 + 96 = 384.\n    This is not good.\n\n    - Let's try an offer where I keep more high-value items: [1, 3, 4, 3, 2] (I give Player 1 this much)\n        - Item 1: 4-1 = 3\n        - Item 2: 4-3 = 1\n        - Item 3: 5-4 = 1\n        - Item 4: 4-3 = 1\n        - Item 5: 3-2 = 1\n        - My Value: (3*40) + (1*10) + (1*47) + (1*47) + (1*48) = 120 + 10 + 47 + 47 + 48 = 272\n        - Still far away from my outside offer\n\n    - Let's try to make sure I get at least close to my outside offer. I will offer very little: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0].\n        - Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4\n        - Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n        - Item 3: 5 - 1 = 4\n        - Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4\n        - Item 5: 3 - 0 = 3\n        - My value: (4*40) + (3*10) + (4*47) + (4*47) + (3*48) = 160 + 30 + 188 + 188 + 144 = 710\n\n    - Let's try something in between. [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n        - Item 1: 4-0=4\n        - Item 2: 4-1=3\n        - Item 3: 5-1=4\n        - Item 4: 4-1=3\n        - Item 5: 3-0=3\n        - My Value: (4*40) + (3*10) + (4*47) + (3*47) + (3*48) = 160 + 30 + 188 + 141 + 144 = 663.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n- Accepting the current offer gives me 605.\n- I can make a counteroffer to potentially get a better deal.\n- However, time is running out and there is a discount factor.\n\nMy best option is to make a counteroffer. The current offer gives me 605. If I counter offer and the negotiation continues, I will at best be in a similar situation to now in round two multiplied by the discount factor of .9.\nSince 605 > 573, accepting this offer seems like the better choice.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 5, 1, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 2 + 3 x 5 + 61 x 1 + 54 x 3 + 75 x 2\n    which is 580 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 581. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means accepting an offer later is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 6, 0, 1, 0]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. My value is: (0 * 55) + (6 * 73) + (0 * 21) + (1 * 25) + (0 * 27) = 0 + 438 + 0 + 25 + 0 = 463.\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 463 is much less than my outside offer of 860. Accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n3) **Consider counteroffers:** I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 860. I have the following total items available. item 1 = 7, item 2 = 6, item 3 = 1, item 4 = 3, item 5 = 2.\n\nLet's consider a scenario where I keep most items, so I give the other player little.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 5, 1, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 2 + 3 x 5 + 61 x 1 + 54 x 3 + 75 x 2\n    which is 580 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 581. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 6, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 of Item 1, 6 of Item 2, 0 of Item 3, 0 of Item 4, and 0 of Item 5. My value would be:\n    (0 * 55) + (6 * 73) + (0 * 21) + (0 * 25) + (0 * 27) = 438\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** 438 < 860. Accepting the current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Potential Counteroffers:**\n\nI need to create an offer where I keep enough items to get a value greater than 860 * 0.9 = 774 after discounting for this being round 2 and the first round having passed already. That means my end value must be greater than my outside offer by a gamma discount factor\n\n**Let's try keeping all of Item 1, no units of Item 2, Item 3, Item 4, or Item 5.**\n\n*   I keep: [7, 0, 1, 3, 2]\n*   Value = (7 * 55) + (0 * 73) + (1 * 21) + (3 * 25) + (2 * 27) = 385 + 0 + 21 + 75 + 54 = 535\n\nThat's not high enough. Let's try giving player 1 as little as possible: \nWe know we need to retain more value than our discounted outside offer which is 860 * 0.9 = 774. Since we need more value, let's try keeping all the high valued items. We will keep item 1, item 2 and part of item 4.\nValue = (7 * 55) + (6 * 73) + (X * 25)\nSince we are keeping 7 of item 1 and 6 of item 2 we get 385 + 438 = 823\nWe can give 1 unit of item 4 since we have exceeded 774 already. Let's also give one of item 5. So we will give away [0,0,0,1,1].\nValue = (7 * 55) + (6 * 73) + (1 * 21) + (2 * 25) + (1 * 27) = 385 + 438 + 21 + 50 + 27 = 921\n\nOkay, this looks promising.\n\n4) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible.

Thus to beat our outside offer in a deal we need our kept value (before discount) to be at least 581/0.81\u2248718.\n\n2) Our private per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 96 (7 units total \u2192 7\u00d796=672)\n\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 3 (6 units total \u2192 6\u00d73=18)\n\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 61 (1 unit total \u2192 61)\n\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 54 (3 units total \u2192 162)\n\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 75 (2 units total \u2192 150)\n\nTo maximize our value while ensuring we exceed the threshold, it makes sense to keep the items we highly value.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 5, 0, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    55 x 7 + 73 x 5 + 21 x 0 + 25 x 2 + 27 x 2\n    which is 854 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 860. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, whatever Player 1 receives from me in a counteroffer is necessarily what I *don't* get.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince 323 > 95, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *in this round*. However, it's Round 1, and there are two more rounds to potentially get a better deal. Accepting right now is almost certainly a mistake, since even a tiny improvement can make a difference.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer. Player 1 is currently offering me 1 of each item. I have to decide if I want to start with a more aggressive or less aggressive counteroffer. It depends on my belief about how rational player 1 is. Since this is round 1, I'm going to start with a more aggressive counteroffer.\n\nI'm going to offer [2, 2, 1, 2, 2] to the other player. This means I keep [6, 4, 2, 4, 3] for myself.\n\nMy value for this offer is (6 * 100) + (4 * 95) + (2 * 57) + (4 * 29) + (3 * 42) = 600 + 380 + 114 + 116 + 126 = 1336. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 1, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 0 + 97 x 6 + 50 x 1 + 86 x 6 + 89 x 0\n    which is 1148 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1149. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Making a counteroffer can give me an even higher value of 1266.3.\nI will propose a counteroffer.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 95. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 95. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 969 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 0 + 95 x 0 + 57 x 0 + 29 x 3 + 42 x 0\n    which is 87 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 95. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [8, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [8, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 95\n   - My item values: Item 1: 100, Item 2: 95, Item 3: 57, Item 4: 29, Item 5: 42\n   - Total items: Item 1: 8, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 6, Item 5: 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 3, the discount factor will be 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n   - Current offer to me: [8, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n   - This means I get 8 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n   - My value from this offer: (8 * 100) + (0 * 95) + (3 * 57) + (1 * 29) + (0 * 42) = 800 + 0 + 171 + 29 + 0 = 1000\n   - Discounted value: 1000 * 0.81 = 810\n\n3) **Compare to outside offer:**\n   - Discounted value of current offer (810) > my outside offer (95)\n\n4) **Consider a counteroffer (as a thought experiment):**\n   - I could try to get more, but this is the last round. If I make a counteroffer, it will be considered a WALK. So let's consider one possible counter offer: [1,1,1,1,1]. I would be left with:\n      - Item 1: 8-1 = 7\n      - Item 2: 6-1 = 5\n      - Item 3: 3-1 = 2\n      - Item 4: 6-1 = 5\n      - Item 5: 5-1 = 4\n   - My value from this counteroffer: (7 * 100) + (5 * 95) + (2 * 57) + (5 * 29) + (4 * 42) = 700 + 475 + 114 + 145 + 168 = 1602\n   - Discounted value: 1602 * 0.81 = 1297.62\n   - This is much better, but making this offer will result in a WALK so I would rather accept the current offer which nets me 810.\n\n5) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer is significantly better than my outside offer.\n   - Making a counteroffer would result in a walk, so I would only get my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 738\n*   My item values: item 1 = 71, item 2 = 7, item 3 = 63, item 4 = 61, item 5 = 34\n*   Total item pool: 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer later is worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [3, 2, 0, 2, 0]. This means:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 71 = 213\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 7 = 14\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 63 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 61 = 122\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 34 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 213 + 14 + 0 + 122 + 0 = 349\n\n    *   Comparison to outside offer: 349 < 738.  The current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate what I would get if I *keep* some items and offer the rest to Player 1. To avoid Mistake #2, the value of what I keep must be greater than 738.\n\n    * I have a total value of 945 for all items.\n    * I need to calculate an offer such that the value of what I keep is greater than 738.\n\n    I need to keep at least:\n    * 0 units of item 1 : 0\n    * 0 units of item 2 : 0\n    * 0 units of item 3 : 0\n    * 0 units of item 4 : 0\n    * 0 units of item 5 : 0\n\nLet's consider what the value of the items given to player 1 would be if I kept a minimal amount of items. I currently have [5, 4, 3, 5, 2] items and my value for those items is [71, 7, 63, 61, 34]\n```\n71 x 5 + 7 x 4 + 63 x 3 + 61 x 5 + 34 x 2 = 355 + 28 + 189 + 305 + 68 = 945\n```\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept. Let's find a possible counteroffer by offering the smallest number of items so that the amount of value I keep is above 738.\n\nI can solve for the smallest amount of value required to be kept to be above the outside offer by subtracting it from my total item value\n```\n945 - 738 = 207\n```\nNow I must offer at least 207 value worth of items to the other player. Given that I should avoid mistake 3 and offering all or nothing, let's start by offering 1 unit of the highest value item 1.\n```\n71 x 1 = 71\n```\nI still need to offer another 136 value worth of items. Let's try to see if I can offer one unit of item 3.\n```\n63 x 1 = 63\n```\nI still need to offer another 73 value worth of items. Let's try to see if I can offer one unit of item 4.\n```\n61 x 1 = 61\n```\nI still need to offer another 12 value worth of items. Let's try to see if I can offer one unit of item 2.\n```\n7 x 1 = 7\n```\nI still need to offer another 5 value worth of items. Since the last item, item 5, has a value of 34, I will offer nothing.\n\nI will offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] units of items [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nI should make a counteroffer.\n\n```\n71 * (5 - 1) + 7 * (4 - 1) + 63 * (3 - 1) + 61 * (5 - 1) + 34 * (2 - 0) = 284 + 21 + 126 + 244 + 68 = 743\n```\nSince my kept value is above 738, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 1, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 1 + 10 x 3 + 67 x 1 + 54 x 5 + 63 x 0\n    which is 374 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 375. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value. An offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [5, 4, 0, 0, 0].  This means I would get 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value would be: 5 * 71 + 4 * 7 + 0 * 63 + 0 * 61 + 0 * 34 = 355 + 28 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 383. Since this is round 2, I would multiply this by 0.9, resulting in 344.7. This is less than my outside offer of 738.\n\n*   **Counteroffer Considerations:** I want to create an offer that gives me a value greater than 738, when multiplied by the discount factor 0.9. That means, I should aim for value over 738/0.9 = 820.\n\nLet's try an example. What if I kept [0, 0, 3, 5, 2]? This means I'd be offering [5, 4, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1.

My value would be: 3 * 71 + 3 * 7 + 3 * 63 + 5 * 61 + 2 * 34 = 213 + 21 + 189 + 305 + 68 = 796.  Still not enough.\n\nLet's try keeping [4, 4, 3, 5, 2] and offering [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My value would be: 4 * 71 + 4 * 7 + 3 * 63 + 5 * 61 + 2 * 34 = 284 + 28 + 189 + 305 + 68 = 874. Multiplying by 0.9 gives me 786.6, which is greater than 738.\n\nLet's try keeping [5, 4, 3, 5, 2] and offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My value would be: 5 * 71 + 4 * 7 + 3 * 63 + 5 * 61 + 2 * 34 = 355 + 28 + 189 + 305 + 68 = 945.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 1, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 1 + 10 x 3 + 67 x 1 + 54 x 5 + 63 x 0\n    which is 374 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 375. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [5, 4, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 409\n*   My item values: item 1 = 30, item 2 = 22, item 3 = 72, item 4 = 7, item 5 = 53\n*   Total items: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means waiting for a future round reduces the value by 10%.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 0, 0, 6]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5.\n    *   My value if I accept: (0 * 30) + (0 * 22) + (0 * 72) + (0 * 7) + (6 * 53) = 318\n    *   Comparison to outside offer: 318 < 409. Accepting is worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 409. Let's explore a few options:\n\n    *   **Option 1:** Keep all items: My value = (2 * 30) + (2 * 22) + (5 * 72) + (1 * 7) + (6 * 53) = 60 + 44 + 360 + 7 + 318 = 789. Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This is valid, but Player 1 would likely walk.\n    *   **Option 2:** Offer Player 1 nothing of Items 1-4 but ask for 0 of item 5. Therefore keeping all of items 1-5. Counteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My Value = 789.\n    *   **Option 3:** Give them one item from Item 3. Offer [2, 2, 1, 1, 6]. My value: (1 * 72) + (6 * 53) = 72 + 318 = 390. This isn't good since 390 < 409\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer (318) is worse than my outside offer (409).\n*   Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] gives me 789.\n\nTherefore, I will propose the counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 5, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 2 + 94 x 0 + 96 x 5 + 66 x 1 + 21 x 5\n    which is 841 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 844. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This round is round 3, so the value of accepting the current offer will be multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 5]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n    My value for this offer is: (0 * 30) + (0 * 22) + (1 * 72) + (0 * 7) + (5 * 53) = 0 + 0 + 72 + 0 + 265 = 337.\n    Considering the discount factor, the present value of accepting this offer is 337 * 0.81 = 272.97.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**  272.97 is less than my outside offer of 409. So accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to make an offer that leaves me with a value greater than 409/0.81 = 504 approximately. Let's consider what I have: 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 1 of item 5. The value of holding these items for me is (2 * 30) + (2 * 22) + (4 * 72) + (1 * 7) + (1 * 53) = 60 + 44 + 288 + 7 + 53 = 452.\nSince this number is less than 504 I should walk.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince accepting the current offer yields a value less than my outside offer, and because it is the final round, making a counteroffer is treated as a walk away. Therefore, I should WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 42. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 684 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 0 + 40 x 1 + 44 x 0 + 55 x 0 + 76 x 0\n    which is 40 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 42. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer later in the game is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\nThe current offer is [0, 3, 0, 5, 0], which means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n(0 * 13) + (3 * 40) + (0 * 44) + (5 * 55) + (0 * 76) = 0 + 120 + 0 + 275 + 0 = 395\n\nSince 395 is much greater than my outside offer of 42, accepting the offer is a good option.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer (395) is significantly higher than my outside offer (42), I should accept the offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This means accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n    - **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 0, 0, 7, 0]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 7 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. My value for this offer is: (0 * 84) + (0 * 26) + (0 * 82) + (7 * 12) + (0 * 7) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 84 + 0 = 84.\n    - **Comparison to outside offer:** 84 is much less than my outside offer of 431. So, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer value of 431. To do this, I need to figure out how many of each item I should keep to maximize my value. Let's try keeping everything except item 4.\n   - Keep: 5 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 5 of item 5\n   - Value: (5 * 84) + (4 * 26) + (4 * 82) + (0 * 12) + (5 * 7) = 420 + 104 + 328 + 0 + 35 = 887\n   - Offer to player 1: 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 7 of item 4, 0 of item 5.\n   - Since keeping the items as above leads to a value of 887 which is greater than my outside option of 431, I will make an offer.\n\nNow, I need to craft a valid counteroffer. A counteroffer should be a list representing what I offer to Player 1, given the total amount of each item available.\n\nI will offer Player 1 the following: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0]\nMy payoff would then be (5*84) + (4*26) + (4*82) + (0*12) + (5*7) = 420 + 104 + 328 + 0 + 35 = 887.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 771. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 588 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 4, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 3 + 85 x 4 + 25 x 4 + 4 x 1 + 40 x 5\n    which is 770 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 771. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 7, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]} \n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n1. My outside offer is 771.\n2. My private values are: item1 = 42, item2 = 85, item3 = 25, item4 = 4, item5 = 40; and the total pool is: [5, 4, 4, 7, 5] with a full value of 878.\n3. In round 2 the discount factor is \u03b3^(2\u20131) = 0.9, so any deal\u2019s raw value gets multiplied by 0.9. To beat my fallback of 771, I need a raw deal value of at least about 771/0.9 \u2248 857.\n4. The current offer on the table, [0,0,0,7,0], gives me only 7 \u00d7 4 = 28, which is far below my fallback.\n5. I thus need to propose a counteroffer that ensures I keep items worth at least 857 in raw value. Since I only have 878 total, I can only sacrifice about 21 value.\n6. Item 4 is the least valuable (worth only 4 per unit) so giving away some of it minimizes the loss. By giving 5 units of item4 to Player 2, I sacrifice 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 value, keeping me with 878 \u2013 20 = 858 in raw value. After the discount, this yields 858 \u00d7 0.9 = 772.2, which is above my outside offer of 771.\n7. Therefore, my counteroffer is to offer Player 2 5 units of item 4 (and nothing of the other items), which in list form is [0, 0, 0, 5, 0].",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 873. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 867 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 5, 2, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 2 + 25 x 5 + 100 x 2 + 62 x 3 + 78 x 4\n    which is 871 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 873. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 109. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 1 + 6 x 1 + 86 x 1 + 91 x 0 + 44 x 0\n    which is 108 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 109. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [5, 5, 2, 0, 4]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I'll offer to Player 1: [5,0,0,0,4].\nMy Value = (0 * 16) + (5 * 6) + (2 * 86) + (4 * 91) + (0 * 44) = 30 + 172 + 364 = 566.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 0, 0, 4]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 367. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 420 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 2, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 0 + 34 x 5 + 14 x 2 + 42 x 4 + 11 x 0\n    which is 366 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 367. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 367\n*   My values for the items: item 1: 39, item 2: 34, item 3: 14, item 4: 42, item 5: 11\n*   Total pool of items: item 1: 1, item 2: 6, item 3: 3, item 4: 5, item 5: 3\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: I am offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep all items:\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 39 = 39\n    *   Item 2: 6 * 34 = 204\n    *   Item 3: 3 * 14 = 42\n    *   Item 4: 5 * 42 = 210\n    *   Item 5: 3 * 11 = 33\n    *   Total value = 39 + 204 + 42 + 210 + 33 = 528\n*   Comparing to outside offer: 528 > 367\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 528, which is much greater than my outside offer of 367.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 371. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 498 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 4, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 2 + 11 x 2 + 20 x 4 + 43 x 1 + 38 x 3\n    which is 367 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 371. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that accepting an offer later is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** [0, 1, 1, 0, 0] (This is what Player 1 offers *me*)\n      - This means I get 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n      - My value for this offer: (0 * 80) + (1 * 35) + (1 * 26) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 60) = 0 + 35 + 26 + 0 + 0 = 61\n      - Since 61 < 347 (my outside offer), accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 347.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 347. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 609 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 0 + 35 x 0 + 26 x 4 + 2 x 1 + 60 x 4\n    which is 346 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 347. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 4, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1021. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 945 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 5, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 3 + 39 x 4 + 100 x 5 + 1 x 3 + 82 x 1\n    which is 1020 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1021. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 727. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 654 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 5, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    44 x 3 + 54 x 4 + 45 x 5 + 72 x 2 + 3 x 3\n    which is 726 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 727. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1.  **Current Situation:**\n    *   My outside offer value: 727\n    *   My values for items: Item 1: 44, Item 2: 54, Item 3: 45, Item 4: 72, Item 5: 3\n    *   Total items: 5 of Item 1, 5 of Item 2, 5 of Item 3, 3 of Item 4, 3 of Item 5\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81\n\n2.  **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n    *   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 0, 3, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value for this offer is:\n        (1 \\* 44) + (1 \\* 54) + (0 \\* 45) + (3 \\* 72) + (0 \\* 3) = 44 + 54 + 0 + 216 + 0 = 314\n\n    Since this is round 3, and the discount factor is 0.81, the discounted value of this offer is: 314 * 0.81 = 254.34\n\n    *   **If I accept the current offer, my value is 254.34. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 727.**\n\n    *   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what items Player 1 seems to value less, and I value more, and vice versa.\n    Looking at the previous offers, Player 1 seems to want item 2 and item 4. They don't seem to value items 1, 3, and 5. I value item 4 highly, so I should try to keep as much of that as possible.\n    Let's calculate the value of some potential counteroffers:\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** Offer Player 1 [4, 4, 4, 0, 2]. This leaves me with [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]. My value would be:\n        (1 \\* 44) + (1 \\* 54) + (1 \\* 45) + (3 \\* 72) + (1 \\* 3) = 44 + 54 + 45 + 216 + 3 = 362\n        Discounted value = 362 * 0.81 = 293.22. Still less than the outside offer.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 2:** Offer Player 1 [4, 5, 5, 0, 3]. This leaves me with [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]. My value would be:\n        (1 \\* 44) + (0 \\* 54) + (0 \\* 45) + (3 \\* 72) + (0 \\* 3) = 44 + 0 + 0 + 216 + 0 = 260\n        Discounted value = 260 * 0.81 = 210.6. Still less than the outside offer.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 3:** Offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This leaves me with [5, 5, 5, 3, 3]. My value would be:\n        (5 \\* 44) + (5 \\* 54) + (5 \\* 45) + (3 \\* 72) + (3 \\* 3) = 220 + 270 + 225 + 216 + 9 = 940\n        Discounted value = 940 * 0.81 = 761.4. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n    * Since this is the last round, making a counteroffer is equivalent to walking away.\n\n3.  **Decision:**\n\n    *   The current offer is worth 254.34, which is less than my outside offer of 727.\n    *   It appears very unlikely I can get Player 1 to offer me a deal that is better than my outside offer.\n    *   Since this is the last round, making a counteroffer is the same as walking away.\n\n    Therefore, I should WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and in round 3, it's worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 4 units of item 1, and 0 units of everything else.\n        *   My value from accepting this offer: (4 * 29) + (0 * 25) + (0 * 60) + (0 * 51) + (0 * 10) = 116.\n        *   Since 116 > 37, accepting this offer is currently better than walking away.\n\n    *   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider some potential counteroffers and their values, keeping in mind the goal is to maximize my payoff and avoid the five mistakes.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   The current offer is worth 116 to me, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 37.\n    *   However, it's only round 1, so there's an opportunity to try and negotiate for a better deal, taking into account the discount factor.\n\n    **Reasoning:**\n\n    Since the current offer is better than my outside offer, I shouldn't walk away or accept immediately. Instead, I should propose a counteroffer, aiming to get more items that I value highly. Because player 1 has offered all of item 1 it may mean it is not as valuable to them so it is worth countering.\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 items they value more and keep more of the ones I value. I need to consider what Player 1 may value. They seem to value item 1 based on the current offer. Let's offer Player 1 a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] since the current offer is so good it could be advantageous to see if player 1 will offer more.\n\n    *   My value from keeping all items: (0 * 29) + (3 * 25) + (3 * 60) + (2 * 51) + (1 * 10) = 0 + 75 + 180 + 102 + 10 = 367\n    *   This is far greater than my walkaway so it would be an acceptable resolution.\n\n    Let's propose counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to test the other player's preferences, to see if they value items I value more.\n    This avoids Mistake 1 because I haven't made a previous offer.\n    This avoids Mistake 2 because my value is 367 > 37\n    This avoids Mistake 3 because I am offering more than nothing.\n    This avoids Mistake 4 because I am not accepting an offer.\n    This avoids Mistake 5 because I am not walking away from an offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 396. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 396. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 630 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 1 + 26 x 2 + 43 x 3 + 72 x 2 + 64 x 1\n    which is 394 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 396. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since it's round 1, the discount doesn't yet apply (0.9^(1-1) = 1).\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n    *   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 0, 5, 0, 0]. This means I get 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. The value of this offer to me is:\n        (2 \\* 25) + (0 \\* 27) + (5 \\* 46) + (0 \\* 66) + (0 \\* 88) = 50 + 0 + 230 + 0 + 0 = 280.\n\n    *   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (280) is less than my outside offer (441). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n    *   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 441, considering what I would keep. Let's explore some possibilities:\n\n        *   **Keeping most valuable items:** I highly value item 5 (88) and item 4 (66). Let's try keeping all of item 5 and all of item 4, and see what minimal amounts of other items I would need to reach >441.\n        *   Keeping [4,7,0,3,2]: (4 * 25) + (7 * 27) + (0 * 46) + (3 * 66) + (2 * 88) = 100 + 189 + 0 + 198 + 176 = 663. If I kept those amounts then the player 1 offer would be [0, 0, 6, 0, 0] which has a value of 0.\n        *   Now let's think about the minimum value that will be above 441.\n            *Offer Player 1 [0,0,0,0,0]\n            *Value is [4*25, 7*27, 6*46, 3*66, 2*88]\n            *Value is [100,189,276,198,176]\n            *Total value = 939\n\n* Let's work backwards from my values. \n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n    *   Accepting the current offer (280) is worse than my outside offer (441), so I should not accept.\n    *   Walking away gives me 441.\n    *   I need to construct a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 441.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 only item 1 and item 3:\n* My offer is [4, 7, 6, 3, 2] for player 2. Total value = 939.\n* My value keeping nothing is 0. This is a bad idea.\n\nLet's try offering player 1 only item 1, 2, and 3.\n* My offer is [4, 7, 6, 0, 0] for player 2.\n* I keep all the values in 4 and 5, which is = 3*66 + 2*88 = 198 + 176 = 374. This is lower than my walkaway. So I should not make this offer.\n\nI'm going to make a counteroffer that gives away relatively less.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 4, 0, 0]}\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 6, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 4 + 60 x 5 + 26 x 6 + 82 x 3 + 75 x 0\n    which is 926 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 927. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting the same offer in earlier rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]. This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value for this offer is (0 * 25) + (0 * 27) + (6 * 46) + (0 * 66) + (0 * 88) = 276.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (276) is less than my outside offer (441). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I am in round 2, I need to consider making a counteroffer.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nLet's aim for a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer of 441.\nI want to keep a combination of items that give me a value exceeding 441.\n\nHere's a possible counteroffer where I keep [4, 7, 0, 3, 2] and give [0, 0, 6, 0, 0] to Player 1.\nMy value would be (4 * 25) + (7 * 27) + (0 * 46) + (3 * 66) + (2 * 88) = 100 + 189 + 0 + 198 + 176 = 663\n\nNow I'll try to make a more reasonable counteroffer. I will give the other player some items in the hope of reaching an agreement.\nI will consider a few options where I try to offer Player 1 a small amount of Items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\nI will start by keeping more of what I value most: items 4 and 5. Then I need enough of the other items to exceed my outside offer.\n\nCounteroffer Idea 1: I keep [2, 3, 2, 1, 1] and offer [2, 4, 4, 2, 1]. My value = (2 * 25) + (3 * 27) + (2 * 46) + (1 * 66) + (1 * 88) = 50 + 81 + 92 + 66 + 88 = 377, which is less than my outside offer.\n\nCounteroffer Idea 2: I keep [3, 5, 3, 2, 1] and offer [1, 2, 3, 1, 1]. My value = (3 * 25) + (5 * 27) + (3 * 46) + (2 * 66) + (1 * 88) = 75 + 135 + 138 + 132 + 88 = 568, which is more than my outside offer.\n\nSo, Counteroffer Idea 2 looks promising.\n\nNow, consider the discount factor.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 6, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 4 + 60 x 5 + 26 x 6 + 82 x 3 + 75 x 0\n    which is 926 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 927. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 5, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 4, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 3, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Your value would be:\n    89 x 0 + 6 x 4 + 80 x 3 + 53 x 2 + 14 x 0\n    which is 370 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 371. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 371.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 89, item 2 = 6, item 3 = 80, item 4 = 53, item 5 = 14.\n*   The total pool of items is: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 6, item 3 = 4, item 4 = 4, item 5 = 3.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth 90% of what it would be worth in the current round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This means I would get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 89) + (0 * 6) + (0 * 80) + (1 * 53) + (1 * 14) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 53 + 14 = 67.\n    *   Since 67 is much less than my outside offer of 371, accepting is not a good option.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate the value of different potential counteroffers to see if I can get a better deal. I also need to take into account that Player 1's offer reflects their values. They are offering me items 4 and 5, which implies they may not value those items as highly as I do. I should try to keep items that I value highly and offer them items that I value less.\n\nLet's consider a few counteroffers:\n\n*   **Counteroffer 1:** I offer Player 1 [0, 3, 0, 2, 2]. This means I keep 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    *   Value to me: (4 * 89) + (3 * 6) + (4 * 80) + (2 * 53) + (1 * 14) = 356 + 18 + 320 + 106 + 14 = 814.\n    *   This is a good value for me, far greater than my outside option.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 2:** I offer Player 1 [1, 6, 1, 4, 3]. This means I keep 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5.\n    *   Value to me: (3 * 89) + (0 * 6) + (3 * 80) + (0 * 53) + (0 * 14) = 267 + 0 + 240 + 0 + 0 = 507.\n    *   This is a good value for me, greater than my outside option.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is very bad for me. I should not accept. Counteroffer 1 looks good, but let's consider one more.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 3:** I offer Player 1 [0, 6, 0, 4, 3]. This means I keep 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5.\n    *   Value to me: (4 * 89) + (0 * 6) + (4 * 80) + (0 * 53) + (0 * 14) = 356 + 0 + 320 + 0 + 0 = 676.\n    *   This is a good value for me, greater than my outside option.\n\nCounteroffer 3 seems like a good starting point since I am keeping items 1 and 3 that I value the most.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 6, 0, 4, 3]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1089. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 762 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

This means that if the negotiation takes longer, the value of any deal diminishes by 10% per round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I receive 1 unit of item 3.\n     - Value of accepting current offer: 1 * 70 = 70.\n     - 70 < 94. Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n   - Consider a counteroffer. I want to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 94.\n\nLet's analyze the implications of Player 1's offer:\nPlayer 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 3. This likely indicates they value item 3 highly or they are willing to trade it for other items they value more. Let's consider some counteroffer strategies. I should avoid mistakes 1-5.\n\nNow, I want to create a counteroffer that provides me with a value exceeding my outside offer. I will start by keeping most of the valuable items for myself.\n\nI could offer [1, 5, 0, 1, 1]\nThen my value will be:\nItem 1: (2-1)*72 = 72\nItem 2: (10-5)*50 = 250\nItem 3: (4-0)*70 = 280\nItem 4: (3-1)*80 = 160\nItem 5: (3-1)*17 = 34\n\nThe total value to me would be: 72+250+280+160+34 = 796 which is greater than 94.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n Since the current offer (70) is worse than my outside offer (94), I should not accept.\n Since I can make a counteroffer such as [1, 5, 0, 1, 1] that leaves me with value 796 > 94, I should not WALK.\n I will make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 0 + 17 x 2 + 43 x 0 + 77 x 0 + 75 x 0\n    which is 34 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 37. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - The current offer is [0, 5, 0, 0, 0] to me. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n   - Value of accepting current offer: (0 * 26) + (5 * 51) + (0 * 29) + (0 * 31) + (0 * 6) = 0 + 255 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 255.\n   - Since 255 > 235, accepting the current offer is better than walking away.\n\n3) **Consider a Counteroffer:**\nThe current offer is pretty good (255), exceeding my outside offer (235). However, there's a chance to get an even better deal if Player 1 values item 2 less than me. Let's consider the total value available.\nTotal value for me if I have all items: (4 * 26) + (5 * 51) + (5 * 29) + (2 * 31) + (1 * 6) = 104 + 255 + 145 + 62 + 6 = 572\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I give them a bit of everything and keep the majority of the high value item 2.\nCounteroffer: [2, 1, 2, 1, 0] This means I keep [2, 4, 3, 1, 1]\nValue to me: (2 * 26) + (4 * 51) + (3 * 29) + (1 * 31) + (1 * 6) = 52 + 204 + 87 + 31 + 6 = 380\n\nIf I am to receive a value of 380, player 1 will have to receive a high value as well.\nSince 380 is far better than my outside offer of 235 and better than the current offer of 255.

This means that any deal in a later round is worth less to me than a deal in the current round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: I am being offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n    *   My value for accepting: (0 * 21) + (0 * 18) + (2 * 40) + (0 * 61) + (0 * 1) = 80.\n*   This value is less than my outside offer of 90.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:** I want to make a counteroffer that benefits me more than my outside offer. To avoid Mistake 2, the value of items I keep must exceed 90.\n\nLet's consider a few potential counteroffers:\n* Offer 1: Player 1 gets [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. I keep all the items. Value = (4*21) + (5*18) + (2*40) + (6*61) + (4*1) = 84 + 90 + 80 + 366 + 4 = 624. That's much better than 90.\n* Offer 2: Player 1 gets [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]. I keep [3, 4, 2, 5, 3]. Value = (3*21) + (4*18) + (2*40) + (5*61) + (3*1) = 63 + 72 + 80 + 305 + 3 = 523. That's also better than 90.\n\nLet's try to find the least I can keep to still be better than 90. I could give away all of item 4 (which is valuable to me) and most of item 3. Say, I keep [4, 5, 0, 0, 4]. Then my value would be 4*21 + 5*18 + 0*40 + 0*61 + 4*1 = 84 + 90 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 178.\nSo the counteroffer [0, 0, 2, 6, 0] would work fine.\nHowever, this is Round 1, and Player 1 offered very little. I want to test them to see how high they value the items. I'll offer them a minimal amount for now.\n\nLet's propose that Player 1 gets [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So, I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 64. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 64. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 597 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    51 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 3 x 2 + 19 x 3 + 100 x 0\n    which is 63 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 64. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 645. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 645. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 933 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 0 + 57 x 1 + 50 x 3 + 61 x 5 + 66 x 2\n    which is 644 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 645. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 645\n   - My values for the items: item 1: 77, item 2: 57, item 3: 50, item 4: 61, item 5: 66\n   - Total pool of items: item 1: 4, item 2: 5, item 3: 5, item 4: 8, item 5: 3\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer to me: [0, 2, 0, 1, 0] (Player 1 receives these items)\n   - This means I get: item 1: 4, item 2: 3, item 3: 5, item 4: 7, item 5: 3\n\n   Value of current offer to me:\n   (4 * 77) + (3 * 57) + (5 * 50) + (7 * 61) + (3 * 66) = 308 + 171 + 250 + 427 + 198 = 1354\n\n   Since 1354 > 645, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *right now*. However, there might be even better counteroffers.\n\n   Now, let's think about potential counteroffers. I need to give *something* to Player 1, otherwise I will be making mistake #3.\n   I also need to ensure the value to me is > 645, otherwise I will be making mistake #2.\n\n   Let's consider some simple counteroffers and evaluate their values.\n    - Offer [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1:\n        - I get [3, 5, 4, 7, 2]\n        - Value to me: (3*77) + (5*57) + (4*50) + (7*61) + (2*66) = 231 + 285 + 200 + 427 + 132 = 1275. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n    - Offer [2, 1, 1, 1, 0] to Player 1:\n        - I get [2, 4, 4, 7, 3]\n        - Value to me: (2*77) + (4*57) + (4*50) + (7*61) + (3*66) = 154 + 228 + 200 + 427 + 198 = 1207. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n    - Offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1:\n        - I get [3, 4, 4, 7, 2]\n        - Value to me: (3*77) + (4*57) + (4*50) + (7*61) + (2*66) = 231 + 228 + 200 + 427 + 132 = 1218\n\n   Since we're in round 1, the discount factor is 1, so we don't need to worry about it *yet*.\n\n   It appears offering something like [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] is better than walking away.\n   Also, the current offer is relatively good (1354). Since it is better than the counteroffers, I will accept it.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   Accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This means that offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Current offer: [0, 1, 3, 0, 1]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\n     * My value for this offer: (0 * 73) + (1 * 62) + (3 * 41) + (0 * 91) + (1 * 100) = 0 + 62 + 123 + 0 + 100 = 285\n   - The current offer is worth 285 to me. This is far less than my outside offer of 791.\n\n   - Now let's consider a counteroffer. I want to find an offer that gives me value greater than my outside offer of 791, while also leaving Player 1 with enough value that they might accept. I have a total value of 819 if I kept everything, so I must give something away.\n\n   I have 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 7 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 2 of item 5\n    Item 1 = 73\n    Item 2 = 62\n    Item 3 = 41\n    Item 4 = 91\n    Item 5 = 100\n    \n    If I kept everything but item 5 = 2, then my total would be 819 - 2*100 = 619 which is below my outside offer. \n\n    I could offer the other player nothing: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

This is less than my outside offer so I reject this.\n\n    Let me consider a counteroffer where I give away 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 1 of item 5. In other words, I am offering them [1, 2, 4, 0, 1].\n    That would mean I keep 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n    My value is (1 * 73) + (1 * 62) + (3 * 41) + (0 * 91) + (1 * 100) = 73 + 62 + 123 + 0 + 100 = 358 which is less than the outside offer of 791.\n\n   Let's try offering [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]. My value is (2 * 73) + (3 * 62) + (4 * 41) + (0 * 91) + (2 * 100) = 146 + 186 + 164 + 0 + 200 = 696 which is less than 791.\n\n   Let's try offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. My value is (2 * 73) + (3 * 62) + (7 * 41) + (0 * 91) + (1 * 100) = 146 + 186 + 287 + 0 + 100 = 719 which is less than 791.\n\n   Let's try offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My value is (2 * 73) + (3 * 62) + (7 * 41) + (0 * 91) + (2 * 100) = 146 + 186 + 287 + 0 + 200 = 819.\n    \n3) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer is not acceptable as it is much lower than my outside offer.\n   - I will make a counteroffer giving nothing away in the hope of getting the other player to increase their offer in round 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 274. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 609 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 4, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 1 + 39 x 1 + 35 x 4 + 35 x 0 + 29 x 1\n    which is 273 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 274.

This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My value for this offer is (0 * 73) + (0 * 62) + (0 * 41) + (0 * 91) + (1 * 100) = 100.  Since this is round 2, I would multiply this by 0.9 to the power of (2-1) which is 0.9.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 1, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 27 x 4 + 48 x 1 + 70 x 6 + 10 x 2\n    which is 596 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 597. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means I could concede up to 1126 \u2013 987 = 139 in value units.\n3. I want to try to make a reasonable offer to the opponent while ensuring I get a value above 987.\n4. Since item 5 is the least valuable to me (15/unit), I can offer all 4 units of item 5 to the opponent. This concedes 4 \u00d7 15 = 60 value, leaving a remaining margin of 139 \u2013 60 = 79.\n5. I then offer 1 unit of item 4 (worth 32 to me). Now total conceded value is 60 + 32 = 92, and the remaining margin is 139 \u2013 92 = 47.\n6. Next, offering 1 unit of item 1 (worth 37) further adds to the concession: 92 + 37 = 129, leaving a slight buffer of 10 value (139 \u2013 129 = 10). Offering any further unit would drop my kept value below my outside offer.\n7. Thus, my counteroffer is to give Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n8. The resulting kept items for me become: item 1: 9\u20131 = 8 units (8\u00d737 = 296), item 2: 7 (7\u00d769 = 483), item 3: 2 (2\u00d777 = 154), item 4: 3\u20131 = 2 (2\u00d732 = 64), and item 5: 4\u20134 = 0. Total = 296 + 483 + 154 + 64 = 997, which is above my fallback of 987 without discount (gamma\u2070=1 in round 1).\n\nTherefore, my action is to propose a counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 4]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 692. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 990 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 0, 0, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 5 + 80 x 0 + 66 x 0 + 80 x 3 + 69 x 4\n    which is 691 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 692. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 2, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 1 + 70 x 4 + 53 x 2 + 1 x 2 + 69 x 0\n    which is 422 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 431. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 783. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 840 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 4, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 14. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 885 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 0 + 72 x 0 + 76 x 0 + 41 x 0 + 36 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 14. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I reason as follows. My outside offer guarantees me a value of 728. I know my per\u2010unit values: item 1 = 20, item 2 = 50, item 3 = 50, item 4 = 49, and item 5 = 32. The full pool is 4, 9, 4, 4, and 4 units, respectively, so if I got everything my total value would be 1054. In round 1 there is no discount (\u03b3^(0)=1), so any immediate deal giving me more than 728 is better than waiting or walking away.\n\nSince I value items 2, 3, and 4 highly (50, 50, and 49 per unit) while item 1 and item 5 are relatively less valuable to me (20 and 32 per unit), I want to keep all of my items in the high\u2010value categories and offer those lower-value ones to Player 2. One straightforward idea is to give Player 2 all of item 1 and item 5. That means offering [4, 0, 0, 0, 4]. Then I keep:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 4\u20134 = 0 units,\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 9\u20130 = 9 units,\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 4\u20130 = 4 units,\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 4\u20130 = 4 units,\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 4\u20134 = 0 units.\nMy total value is:\n\u200320\u00d70 + 50\u00d79 + 50\u00d74 + 49\u00d74 + 32\u00d70 = 0 + 450 + 200 + 196 + 0 = 846,\nwhich is safely above my outside offer of 728.\n\nThis initial counteroffer gives up items that provide me with the least value while offering Player 2 tangible assets that may be valuable for them. It avoids the pitfalls: I am not making an offer worse than my fallback, nor wasting concessions on items that are very valuable to me.\n\nThus, my action in round 1 is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 0, 0, 4]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 197. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 789 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 2, 6, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 6 + 84 x 2 + 14 x 6 + 9 x 3 + 89 x 5\n    which is 790 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 794. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 3, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 3, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 518. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 654 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 7, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 0 + 7 x 1 + 97 x 1 + 59 x 7 + 36 x 0\n    which is 517 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 518. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 245. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 561 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1096. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1089 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 4, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 3 + 78 x 1 + 83 x 4 + 21 x 2 + 100 x 4\n    which is 1095 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1096. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 208. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 672 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 2 + 6 x 1 + 62 x 0 + 56 x 0 + 90 x 2\n    which is 206 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 208.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 222. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 519 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 0 + 57 x 3 + 40 x 0 + 16 x 1 + 17 x 2\n    which is 221 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 222. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 8, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 8, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 2, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "My reasoning:\n1. My outside offer guarantees me 654 points. I must ensure that my accepted outcome gives me a value strictly above that.\n2. My private values per unit are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 10\u2003\u2003(1 unit)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 65\u2003\u2003(5 units)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 59\u2003\u2003(3 units)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 26\u2003\u2003(6 units)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 26\u2003\u2003(6 units)\n\u2003\u2003The total if I keep everything is 824, but my alternative (outside offer) is 654.\n3. In a counteroffer, I state the amount of items I give to Player 2. I then keep the remainder for myself and my value is computed by multiplying the units I keep by my private values.\n4. Because items 2 and 3 have high value for me (65 and 59 per unit), I want to keep all of those. Similarly, I want to keep as many units as possible of items that push my total above 654.\n5. One possible proposal is to give Player 2 only some of the lower-valued items (items 1, 4, and 5). For example, if I give away:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 1 (all of it),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 2,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 3,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 3 units of item 4,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 3 units of item 5,\nthen I will keep:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 1: 0 (0 \u00d7 10 = 0),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 2: 5 (5 \u00d7 65 = 325),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 3: 3 (3 \u00d7 59 = 177),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 4: 3 (3 \u00d7 26 = 78),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 5: 3 (3 \u00d7 26 = 78).\nAdding these gives a total value 325 + 177 + 78 + 78 = 658.\n6. This total of 658 is above my outside offer value of 654, so I avoid making the error of proposing a division worse than my fallback. It also means I am not giving away high-value items (items 2 and 3) and I offer a small, but potentially attractive, share of lower-valued items (items 1, 4, 5) to Player 2.\n7. Based on these numbers and ensuring I avoid all five mistakes, my best move in Round 1 is to propose the counteroffer that gives Player 2 [1, 0, 0, 3, 3] units.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 3, 3]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 372. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1104 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 7, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 4 + 29 x 7 + 94 x 0 + 56 x 1 + 82 x 3\n    which is 573 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 574. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The full pool\u2019s total value to me is 1229 if I got everything.\n\u2003\u2022 With a discount rate of 0.9 (\u03b3) per additional round, waiting will reduce the present value of any potential agreement. It is therefore important that any deal we make now yields a value for me above my outside offer (574).\n\u2003\u2022 Since I must avoid giving an offer that leaves me with less than 574 (mistake 2) and also must avoid offering nothing to the opponent (mistake 3), I need to propose an initial division that leaves me with a strong value while \u201csacrificing\u201d a few units that might convince Player 2 to agree.\n\n2) Assessing potential offers:\n\u2003I can decide on how many units to give to Player 2 (the offer) and my own share will be the remaining items. For example, if I give Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 1 of item 5, then my share is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 5 \u2013 1 = 4\u2003\u2003\u2002value: 4 \u00d7 17 = 68\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 8 \u2013 1 = 7\u2003\u2003\u2002value: 7 \u00d7 29 = 203\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3 \u2013 0 = 3\u2003\u2003\u2002value: 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 1 \u2013 0 = 1\u2003\u2003\u2002value: 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 7 \u2013 1 = 6\u2003\u2003\u2002value: 6 \u00d7 82 = 492\n\u2003Then, my total value is 68 + 203 + 282 + 56 + 492 = 1101, which safely exceeds my outside offer of 574.\n\u2003This offer avoids the mistakes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Mistake 2: My kept value (1101) is well above 574.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Mistake 3: I am not offering nothing or all items.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Mistake 1: There is no previous offer to compare against.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Mistake 4 or 5: I\u2019m ensuring my proposal is above my outside alternative.\n\n3) Decision:\n\u2003Given the analysis, I propose the counteroffer where I offer Player 2: [1, 1, 0, 0, 1] units (i.e. I give away 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, none of item 3 or 4, and 1 unit of item 5).

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 20. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 20. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 606 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 57 x 0 + 69 x 0 + 6 x 3 + 23 x 0\n    which is 18 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 20. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 113. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 882 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 0 + 59 x 0 + 32 x 2 + 46 x 1 + 89 x 0\n    which is 110 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 113. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1265. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 900 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 1, 9, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 172. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 0 + 5 x 2 + 35 x 2 + 87 x 0 + 88 x 1\n    which is 168 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 172. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 4, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 4, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 6, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 1 + 24 x 0 + 18 x 6 + 83 x 4 + 10 x 2\n    which is 505 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 508. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 698. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1329 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 259. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 44 x 0 + 53 x 3 + 79 x 0 + 33 x 3\n    which is 258 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 259. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Step 1 \u2013 Analyze the current situation:\n\u2022 My outside offer is 429.\n\u2022 My private values per unit are: item 1 = 54, item 2 = 60, item 3 = 61, item 4 = 15, and item 5 = 24.\n\u2022 The total available units are: [4, 8, 5, 8, 5].\n\u2022 The discount factor is 0.9. In round 1 the discount exponent is 0, so any accepted division now is not discounted (multiplied by 1). Waiting for a later round incurs a discount, so a good offer now is ideal.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Assessing potential offers:\n\u2022 The goal is to secure for myself a bundle with a total value significantly above my outside offer (429) while offering the opponent items that may be attractive to them.\n\u2022 My share from any offer is computed by subtracting what I offer (the offer list is what I give to Player 2) from the totals. For example, if I propose to give Player 2 the vector [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5], my share is [4 \u2013 x1, 8 \u2013 x2, 5 \u2013 x3, 8 \u2013 x4, 5 \u2013 x5] with total value = 54\u00d7(4 \u2013 x1) + 60\u00d7(8 \u2013 x2) + 61\u00d7(5 \u2013 x3) + 15\u00d7(8 \u2013 x4) + 24\u00d7(5 \u2013 x5).\n\u2022 I must be careful to avoid mistakes like offering myself less than my outside offer or worsening my previous offers. I must also give a nonextreme split (not giving nothing or everything).\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Building a candidate offer:\n\u2022 I want to secure a high-valued bundle. I choose to keep most of the high value items (items 1, 2, 3) and offer more of those items that I value less (items 4 and 5).\n\u2022 For example, consider offering: \n\u2003\u2013 Give 1 unit of item 1. I then keep 3 units (3\u00d754 = 162).\n\u2003\u2013 Give 2 units of item 2. I keep 6 units (6\u00d760 = 360).\n\u2003\u2013 Give 0 units of item 3. I keep all 5 units (5\u00d761 = 305).\n\u2003\u2013 Give 6 units of item 4. I keep 2 units (2\u00d715 = 30).\n\u2003\u2013 Give 3 units of item 5. I keep 2 units (2\u00d724 = 48).\n\u2022 My total value then becomes 162 + 360 + 305 + 30 + 48 = 905, which is well over my outside offer of 429. This also avoids giving away my high value items while offering a good share of lower value ones to the opponent.\n\nStep 4 \u2013 Decision:\n\u2022 I will make this counteroffer as it ensures my kept share is worth 905 (well above my fallback) and offers the opponent a package that might be appealing to them (presumably valuable in items they might value differently).\n\nFinal Action:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1,2,0,6,3]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 2108. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1113 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 8, 1, 7, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 4 + 73 x 8 + 13 x 1 + 91 x 7 + 95 x 5\n    which is 2105 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 2108. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 6, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 6, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 654. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 687 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 47. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 432 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 1 + 43 x 0 + 36 x 0 + 13 x 2 + 34 x 0\n    which is 44 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 47. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 41 x 0 + 100 x 0 + 16 x 0 + 7 x 1\n    which is 7 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 8. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1096. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 810 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 6, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 2 + 76 x 4 + 31 x 6 + 48 x 3 + 77 x 5\n    which is 1095 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1096. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    55 x 0 + 20 x 2 + 94 x 0 + 52 x 0 + 78 x 0\n    which is 40 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 44. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 0 + 16 x 3 + 94 x 2 + 58 x 4 + 11 x 1\n    which is 479 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 480.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 972. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 648 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 0, 7, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 4 + 30 x 2 + 21 x 0 + 83 x 7 + 2 x 5\n    which is 971 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 972. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 134. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 531 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 278. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 426 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 0 + 37 x 0 + 75 x 3 + 3 x 2 + 23 x 2\n    which is 277 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 278. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "My reasoning:\n\n1. My outside offer is 278, which means I must make sure that whatever division I secure gives me a value higher than 278. In addition, since this is round 1 (with no discount yet), the full value of the shares I expect to receive matters.\n\n2. My private values per unit are: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 37, item 3 = 75, item 4 = 3, and item 5 = 23. The available amounts are [5, 7, 7, 2, 5] respectively. To maximize my own outcome, I want to keep as many of the high-value items (especially items 2, 3, and 5) as possible while offering the opponent items that I value less (items 1 and 4 have low value for me).\n\n3. A possible aggressive\u2014and strategically reasonable\u2014counteroffer is to give the opponent all of item 1 (all 5 units) and all of item 4 (both units), and only a small portion of items 2 and 5. I propose giving the opponent 2 units of item 2 and 2 units of item 5 while retaining all of item 3 and the remaining units of items 2 and 5.\n\n4. Under this offer the division is as follows:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Offered to opponent (my offer): [5, 2, 0, 2, 2]\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 I keep: item 1: 5\u20135 = 0, item 2: 7\u20132 = 5, item 3: 7\u20130 = 7, item 4: 2\u20132 = 0, item 5: 5\u20132 = 3\n\n5. My value from what I keep calculates as:\n\u2003\u2003- Item 1: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n\u2003\u2003- Item 2: 5 \u00d7 37 = 185\n\u2003\u2003- Item 3: 7 \u00d7 75 = 525\n\u2003\u2003- Item 4: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n\u2003\u2003- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 23 = 69\n\u2003\u2003Total = 185 + 525 + 69 = 779\n\n6. Since 779 is well above my fallback of 278, this proposal meets objective criteria (avoiding Mistake 2 and Mistake 4). By offering the opponent the items I value less, I maximize my own retained value while still giving the opponent something worthwhile to potentially agree to.\n\nBased on this analysis, I make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 2, 0, 2, 2]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 1 + 31 x 1 + 28 x 0 + 47 x 0 + 36 x 0\n    which is 96 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 97. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 209. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 209. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 1 + 10 x 1 + 94 x 0 + 49 x 1 + 18 x 3\n    which is 208 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 209. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.
