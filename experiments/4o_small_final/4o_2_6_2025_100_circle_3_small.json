Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 130. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 99 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

A possible desirable division could be one that gives Player 2 a reasonable share, ensuring I get more value than 130, discounted by 0.9 (considering we're in round 1, which ends after our offers exchange).\n   - Let's propose giving fewer high-value items to Player 2. Consider this offer to Player 2, where I try to retain more units of items with higher total multiplicative values:\n     - Offer Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n     - I keep: 4 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n\n   **Calculate my total value for this counteroffer:**\n   - 4 units of Item 1: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n   - 8 units of Item 2: 8 \u00d7 8 = 64\n   - 3 units of Item 3: 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n   - 0 units of Item 4: 0 \u00d7 6 = 0\n   - 4 units of Item 5: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n   - Total = 24 + 64 + 21 + 0 + 24 = 133\n\n   The total value of this offer exceeds my outside offer value of 130.\n\n3. **Make a decision:**\n   - I should propose the above counteroffer as it maximizes my value considering the constraints and exceeds my outside offer value.\n\nI will propose the following action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 4, 2, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 4, 2, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I need to evaluate the situation thoroughly.\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 140\n   - Values of the items involved:\n     - Item 1: 10\n     - Item 2: 8\n     - Item 3: 8\n     - Item 4: 7\n     - Item 5: 6\n   - Total pool of items: 6 units of item 1, 10 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: Since it's round 2, the discount factor is \\( \\gamma^{r-1} = 0.9^{2-1} = 0.9 \\).\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer [3, 4, 2, 0, 3]:**\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n     - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n     - Total value = 30 + 32 + 16 + 0 + 18 = 96\n     - Discounted value in round 2 = 96 \u00d7 0.9 = 86.4\n\n   - **Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n     - The discounted value of the current offer (86.4) is significantly less than my outside offer value (140).\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n\n   Since the current offer is significantly lower in value compared to my outside option, accepting it is not advantageous. Walking away with my outside offer value gives me a better payoff. However, making a counteroffer could also be considered if it presents a value above my outside offer.\n\n   **Proposing a Counteroffer that Maximizes My Value:**\n   I want to pull more value from the available pool while still making it appealing for Player 1 to consider. Let's try this division:\n\n   - Counteroffer [2, 6, 2, 0, 5] (meaning I propose to give Player 1):\n     - This leaves me with:\n       - Item 1: 4 units, value = 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n       - Item 2: 4 units, value = 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n       - Item 3: 3 units, value = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n       - Item 4: 1 unit, value = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n       - Item 5: 1 unit, value = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n     - Total value = 40 + 32 + 24 + 7 + 6 = 109\n     - Discounted value in round 2 = 109 \u00d7 0.9 = 98.1\n\nEven this potential counteroffer value falls below my outside option of 140. Therefore, the best action is to WALK away. \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

The value of rejecting this round would lead us into future rounds where the value diminishes due to the gamma of 0.9.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table from Player 2.\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffers and Their Values**:\n  - To justify a counteroffer, I need to ensure that the value to me is greater than my outside offer of 58.\n  \n  For example, if I offer:\n  - 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5, I would retain everything:\n    - Value = (4 * 2) + (5 * 10) + (5 * 10) + (2 * 10) + (3 * 10) = 8 + 50 + 50 + 20 + 30 = 158\n\n  Another approach is a more balanced offer:\n  - If I offer 2 units of each available item, the calculation would be:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 2 = 4\n    - 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 10 = 30\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 10 = 30\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 10 = 10\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 2 * 10 = 20\n    - Total value = 4 + 30 + 30 + 10 + 20 = 94\n\n  This second choice isn't as optimal as holding everything but ensures a very high value allocation and opportunity for Player 2 to engage.\n\n### Step 3: Decision\n\n- **Accept the Current Offer**: Not applicable because there is no current offer.\n- **Walk Away**: This choice guarantees a value of 58.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer**: Aim for a minimum value higher than my outside offer.\n\nGiven the potential counteroffer value calculations, even offering 2 units of item 1, 2 items of item 4, and 1 item of item 5, I still receive more than 58 in value while leaving less attractive items, possibly encouraging the other party to engage in negotiation.\n\nThus, my action is to propose a counteroffer that maximizes my retained value while being reasonable enough for the other party to consider:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]}\n```\n\nThis offer allocates maximum personal value while ensuring potential acceptance by offering a substantial part of less valuable items.",

To achieve my outside offer value of 104, I'll plan an offer that leaves me with more value than this, preferably maximizing my total value:\n     - Let\u2019s offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\n3) Calculating the total value for this division:\n   - My portion (items I keep):\n     - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n     - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 6 = 30\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - Total value = 85\n\n4) Compare this value (85) to my outside offer (104):\n   - The value (85) of this division is lower than my outside offer (104). Therefore, this is not acceptable.\n   - I will adjust the weights to reach a proposal that increases my value, aiming for at least a total of 104.\n\nLet's try to recalculate or reoffer a new division to maximize my value:\n   - Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n   - Recalculate my value:\n     - My portion:\n       - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n       - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n       - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n     - Total value = 74\n\nGiven this, it\u2019s still inadequate compared to my outside offer. I\u2019ll refine further, seeking to find a balanced approach:\n\n   - Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n   - Recalculate my portion:\n     - My portion:\n       - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n       - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n     - Total value = 71\n\nStill not sufficient; hence, another configuration:\n   \n   - Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   - Recalculate my value:\n     - My portion:\n       - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n       - 1 units of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n     - Total value = 65\n\nUltimately, I need to craft an offer that makes both sides appealing toward negotiation. However, since all current divisions do not meet or exceed my outside offer after multiple attempts, I could either:\n   - Rebalance for next rounds or\n   - Secure the offer close or up against my outside bid.\n   \nTherefore, I'll propose an alternative offer:\n  \n   - Transfer Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nFinal assessment and step to act:\n\nGiven no successful allocation satisfies the threshold (gear beyond 104) after reasonable fluctuations and item redistribution repeatedly, I must decide decisively in retaliation to legitimize:\n\nGiven the ongoing target-place, I'll evoke pushback finding close resolve outputs square the counter:\n  \n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 5, 4, 3]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 78. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 96 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on the best action, let's go through the steps:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 78.\n   - My values for the items:\n     - Item 1: 3\n     - Item 2: 4\n     - Item 3: 10\n     - Item 4: 10\n     - Item 5: 5\n   - Total pool of items: [2, 6, 2, 5, 5]\n   - Discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. Since this is round 1, no discount is applied yet as (round-1) is 0.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n   - Current offer to me: [0, 2, 0, 3, 3]\n     - Value of item 1: 0 * 3 = 0\n     - Value of item 2: 2 * 4 = 8\n     - Value of item 3: 0 * 10 = 0\n     - Value of item 4: 3 * 10 = 30\n     - Value of item 5: 3 * 5 = 15\n     - Total value = 0 + 8 + 0 + 30 + 15 = 53\n\n   - The current offer gives me a total value of 53, which is less than my outside offer of 78.\n\n3) **Assess potential counteroffers:**\n   - To propose a counteroffer, I need to at least meet or exceed my outside offer value. Let's consider a new distribution:\n     - I want to aim for a value of at least 78 without giving too much to Player 1.\n     - A possible division for maximizing my value: keep most of the high-value items.\n     - If I keep [2, 4, 2, 2, 2], I give Player 1: [0, 2, 0, 3, 3] (same initial consideration as Player 1)\n\n   However, the counteroffer under consideration still yields a value of 53 to me. Given the potential gains in succeeding rounds and comparing possible strategies, it seems more beneficial to propose a fairer counteroffer.\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\n   - Since the current offer value of 53 is less than my outside offer of 78, accepting it is not attractive.\n   - Walking away gives me a guaranteed 78.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer to try and reach or exceed the value of the outside offer: \n     - New counteroffer to consider: [0, 1, 0, 3, 4]\n     - This means I plan to receive [2, 5, 2, 2, 1].\n     - Calculating value for me: \n       - Item 1: 2 * 3 = 6\n       - Item 2: 5 * 4 = 20\n       - Item 3: 2 * 10 = 20\n       - Item 4: 2 * 10 = 20\n       - Item 5: 1 * 5 = 5\n       Total value = 6 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 5 = 71\n\n   However, the value is close but slightly below the outside offer. This reflects the situation's complexity, so it's worth adjusting slightly one more time.\n   Let\u2019s attempt an alternative value negotiation:\n\nA more refined counter-offering strategy ensures higher cumulative returns or a slightly more conservative targeted distribution with consideration of both maximal gains. Walking away passes the threshold, and aiming for an ideal mix while still close to the value balances the offer with my needs.\n\nLet\u2019s optimize the discussed counteroffer which maximizes returns and ideally crosses the 78 threshold, or take away with values:\n\nFinal counteroffer proposal: [0, 1, 0, 3, 4]\n\nThis balances trade-offs across rounds while still allowing competitiveness in holding for maximal yet conservative negotiation value rounding adjustments. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 3, 4]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's evaluate the situation according to the questions:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n   - My outside offer value is 30.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 8\n     - Item 2: 9\n     - Item 3: 3\n     - Item 4: 2\n     - Item 5: 1\n   - Total pool of items: 5 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma) influences the present value of negotiations. In Round 1, the discount factor does not apply yet, but it will reduce the value in subsequent rounds by a factor of 0.9 each round after the first.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - Current offer from Player 1 is [2, 4, 2, 2, 2] for me. This means I receive:\n     - 3 units of item 1 (5 - 2) = 3 * 8 = 24\n     - 4 units of item 2 (8 - 4) = 4 * 9 = 36\n     - 2 units of item 3 (4 - 2) = 2 * 3 = 6\n     - 3 units of item 4 (5 - 2) = 3 * 2 = 6\n     - 3 units of item 5 (5 - 2) = 3 * 1 = 3\n     - Total value from current offer: 24 + 36 + 6 + 6 + 3 = 75\n\n   - This total value (75) is well above my outside offer (30), indicating that I am better off accepting this offer rather than walking away. Any counteroffer should provide me greater than 75 in value to justify further negotiation.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n   - Should I accept the current offer? Yes, because it provides me with a value of 75, which is significantly higher than my outside option of 30.\n   - Should I walk away? No, since the value of the current offer is much higher than my outside offer.\n   - Should I propose a specific counteroffer? It's unnecessary, as the current offer already exceeds my outside option considerably.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is beneficial to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This influences the value by reducing the effective outcome value in future rounds. Given this is round 1, there's no discount applied yet.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer to consider.\n   - For potential counteroffers, I will need to keep a total value greater than my outside offer of 91, factoring potential future discounts. \n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Since this is round 1, I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes the value for me while considering potential agreement in future rounds, if necessary.\n   - I will make an initial offer that ensures I have a value higher than 91 in this round.\n\nLet's create a potential offer:\n- Suppose I offer:\n  - 2 units of Item 1 (leaving me 2 units)\n  - 4 units of Item 2 (leaving me 4 units)\n  - 1 unit of Item 3 (leaving me 2 units)\n  - 1 unit of Item 4 (leaving me 2 units)\n  - 2 units of Item 5 (leaving me 3 units)\n- My received items would then be:\n  - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n  - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 8 = 32\n  - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 6 = 12\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n  - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 10 = 30\n\nCalculating total value: 8 + 32 + 12 + 8 + 30 = 90\n\nGiven that the total value I can currently achieve (90) is still slightly below my outside offer due to the high value I place on items, optimizing future offers may be better.

I\u2019ll propose I get more items with higher personal value.\n\nFor example, if I keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 5 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nThis would mean I offer [2, 2, 3, 1, 1] to Player 1:\n\n- My units:\n  - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n  - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n  - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n  - 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 7 = 35\n  - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n  - Total value = 2 + 2 + 4 + 35 + 27 = 70\n\nSince 70 is greater than my outside offer value of 56, this counteroffer is beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I will propose a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 3, 1, 1]}\n```",

After round 2, any deal will be discounted by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. My outside offer value (92) will not be affected by this discount if I choose to walk away.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [2, 2, 3, 1, 1]\n     - This means I receive:\n       - 2 units of Item 1 = 2 * 2 = 4\n       - 2 units of Item 2 = 2 * 2 = 4\n       - 3 units of Item 3 = 3 * 10 = 30\n       - 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 * 2 = 2\n       - 1 unit of Item 5 = 1 * 7 = 7\n     - Total value = 4 + 4 + 30 + 2 + 7 = 47\n     - Adjusted for discount factor: 47 * 0.9 = 42.3\n\n   - Counteroffer Analysis:\n     - I need a counteroffer that maximizes my value, more than my outside offer, which will give me more than 92 especially after the discount. Let's try some potential distributions to see if we can achieve better than a discounted value of my outside offer (92 * 0.9 = 82.8).\n     - Available items for me in the best case would be [1, 1, 2, 5, 3]:\n       - 1 unit of Item 1 = 1 * 2 = 2\n       - 1 unit of Item 2 = 1 * 2 = 2\n       - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 * 10 = 20\n       - 5 units of Item 4 = 5 * 2 = 10\n       - 3 units of Item 5 = 3 * 7 = 21\n       - Total value = 2 + 2 + 20 + 10 + 21 = 55\n       - Adjusted for a 0.9 discount factor in a future round would give 55 * 0.9^2 = 44.55\n\n   - None of these values for counteroffers would achieve a result higher than my outside offer when discounted.\n\n3) Decision:\n   - The current offer's value (42.3) is significantly less than my outside offer (92 when discounted), and my best potential counteroffer still doesn't exceed it.\n   - Given the discount factor and the lack of better options, it makes sense to WALK away and take the outside offer.\n\nIn conclusion, my best action is to WALK.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Ideally, I want my counteroffer to retain more units of items 1, 3, and 5 or secure item 4 because of their relatively higher values.\n\nLet's create a counteroffer:\n- Offer [2, 1, 1, 0, 3] to Player 1, and I will keep:\n  - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 7 per unit = 14\n  - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 1 per unit = 0\n  - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 7 per unit = 14\n  - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 8 per unit = 8\n  - Item 5: 5 units \u00d7 5 per unit = 25\n  - Total value = 14 + 0 + 14 + 8 + 25 = 61\n\nThis offer does not exceed my outside offer, so I need to adjust to a better division:\n\n- New counter offer: [2, 1, 1, 0, 2] to Player 1, keeping:\n  - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 7 = 14\n  - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 1 = 0\n  - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 7 = 14\n  - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 8 = 8\n  - Item 5: 6 units \u00d7 5 = 30\n  - Total value = 14 + 0 + 14 + 8 + 30 = 66\n\nThe value of this new distribution (66) exceeds my outside offer of 63. I will propose this as my counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 0, 2]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision on my action, I will follow the structured analysis as outlined:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 130.\n- **Values of Items to Me:**\n  - Item 1: 9 per unit\n  - Item 2: 4 per unit\n  - Item 3: 6 per unit\n  - Item 4: 6 per unit\n  - Item 5: 4 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 6 units\n  - Item 2: 1 unit\n  - Item 3: 6 units\n  - Item 4: 5 units\n  - Item 5: 5 units\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor is 0.9. Waiting for future offers reduces the potential value unless a better immediate offer is available.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nThere is no current offer on the table, so I'll analyze potential counteroffers:\n\n- **Evaluate a potential counteroffer** where I keep the maximum possible value greater than 130:\n  - To maximize my value beyond my outside offer, suppose I propose giving Player 2:\n    - 1 unit of Item 1\n    - 0 units of Item 2\n    - 2 units of Item 3\n    - 1 unit of Item 4\n    - 2 units of Item 5\n    \n  - **My Remaining Take:**\n    - Item 1: 5 units (value = 5 \u00d7 9 = 45)\n    - Item 2: 1 unit (value = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4)\n    - Item 3: 4 units (value = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24)\n    - Item 4: 4 units (value = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24)\n    - Item 5: 3 units (value = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12)\n  - **Total Value to Me:** \n    - Total = 45 + 4 + 24 + 24 + 12 = 109 \n\nThis total is below the value of my outside offer (130). I need to keep more items to reach a value above 130. \n\n- **Re-evaluate with a slightly adjusted counteroffer** to increase my value:\n  - **Give Player 2:**\n    - 0 units of Item 1\n    - 0 units of Item 2\n    - 2 units of Item 3\n    - 0 units of Item 4\n    - 1 unit of Item 5\n\n  - **My Remaining Take:**\n    - Item 1: 6 units (value = 6 \u00d7 9 = 54)\n    - Item 2: 1 unit (value = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4)\n    - Item 3: 4 units (value = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24)\n    - Item 4: 5 units (value = 5 \u00d7 6 = 30)\n    - Item 5: 4 units (value = 4 \u00d7 4 = 16)\n  - **Total Value to Me:** \n    - Total = 54 + 4 + 24 + 30 + 16 = 128\n\nThis is close to 130 but still slightly below. Let\u2019s optimize further:\n\n### Step 3: Decision\n\nI will propose retaining:\n- 5 units of Item 1 (giving up 1)\n- 1 units of Item 2 (giving up 0)\n- 4 units of Item 3 (giving up 2)\n- 4 units of Item 4 (giving up 1)\n- 3 units of Item 5 (giving up 2)\n\nThis would result in my having a total value:\n- Item 1: 5 \u00d7 9 = 45\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n- Item 3: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n- Item 4: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n\nTotal = 109, still not optimal. To maximize value closer to or above 130, I need to adjust further. Let me try one more configuration:\n\n- **Final Adjusted Counteroffer:**\n  - Give Player 2: [0, 0, 2, 0, 1] \n  - Remaining value to me: \n    - 54 (from Item 1) + 4 (from Item 2) + 24 (from Item 3) + 30 (from Item 4) + 16 (from Item 5) = 128 again still not above 130.\n- I\u2019d protect my interest by keeping maximum high-valued items.\n\nGiven current scenarios, my valuation needs to keep or try taking more items. An optimized version would be then holding close with a direct approach to ensure substantial hold of high-valued items and strategically engage with a contention offer to delineate or ideally provide a counteroffer that acknowledges negotiation aptitude as I tighten the stance from relinquishing an exhaustive approximation of inventory items.\n\nThat said:\n\n**My Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\nGiven the analysis, it's strategically better to take my outside offer, given the calculated adjustments make it unachievable to conclusively reach or exceed my guaranteed offer target.",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 27. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 81 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

If I decide in the first round, the discount factor doesn't apply (\u03b3^0 = 1), but in subsequent rounds, it reduces the effective value to me by a factor of 0.9^r.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [2, 0, 1, 1, 3] (my share)\n     - Value calculation:\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 7 = 14\n       - 0 unit of item 2 = 0 * 1 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 3 = 3\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 3 = 3\n       - 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 2 = 6\n     - Total value of current offer = 14 + 0 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 26.\n   \n   - Potential counteroffer must provide me a value greater than 26 to be considered better than my outside offer, and ideally even better due to negotiations lasting multiple rounds and potentially benefiting from offering a bit more to Player 1 initially to secure a deal this round.\n   \n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The value of the current offer is exactly 26, equal to my outside offer. Accepting it means I avoid potential reduction from the discount factor in future rounds.\n\nGiven the calculations, the current offer gives me equal value to my outside offer (26), and I receive this immediately without risking reductions from the discount factor in later rounds.

But let's focus on this first round.\n\n   **Formulate an initial counteroffer:** \n   - My goal is to secure a deal with a total value greater than 72 but ideally less than 179 without discounting yet.\n   - A balanced offer might allow me to negotiate slightly in my favor initially.\n   - Potential initial offer giving a greater share of lower-value items:\n\n     Let's try offering Player 2:\n     - 6 units of item 1 (I keep 1, value to me: 2)\n     - 2 units of item 2 (I keep 3, value to me: 30)\n     - 0 units of item 3 (I keep 1, value to me: 5)\n     - 2 units of item 4 (I keep 3, value to me: 30)\n     - 3 units of item 5 (I keep 3, value to me: 30)\n\n   **Total value for me:**\n   - Value = 2 (item 1) + 30 (item 2) + 5 (item 3) + 30 (item 4) + 30 (item 5)\n   - Value = 97\n\n   This initial offer gives me a value of 97, which is higher than my outside offer of 72. \n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Based on this assessment, I will make a counteroffer that gives me more than my outside offer value, aiming for a positive settlement.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 2, 0, 2, 3]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If negotiations extend to further rounds, the value decreases. Accepting a favorable offer early might maximize net value due to this factor.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer from Player 2.\n   - I must create an initial offer where my value exceeds my outside offer of 28.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Given my values, let's calculate a potential counteroffer where I keep enough items to exceed the outside value.\n   - Suppose I offer the following to Player 2: `[3, 0, 0, 1, 0]`. That means I keep: \n     - 7 units of item 1 (63 value)\n     - 2 units of item 2 (16 value)\n     - 3 units of item 3 (9 value)\n     - 3 units of item 4 (15 value)\n     - 2 units of item 5 (20 value)\n\n   Total value = 63 + 16 + 9 + 15 + 20 = **123**\n\n   - The total value of 123 is significantly higher than my outside offer value.

Since we are in round 1, this does not yet reduce the value, but it's important to consider future rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: I receive [3, 0, 0, 1, 0].

I'll attempt to construct a counteroffer:\n\n- Offer units of item 1 = 5 to Player 1\n- Offer units of item 2 = 0 to Player 1\n- Offer units of item 3 = 3 to Player 1\n- Offer units of item 4 = 0 to Player 1 \n- Offer units of item 5 = 2 to Player 1\n\nFor this counteroffer, I would receive:\n- 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 2 = 10\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 4 = 16\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n\nTotal value I receive = 10 + 12 + 0 + 16 + 0 = 38\n\nThis value of 38 is not enough to exceed my outside offer; therefore, I could walk away instead. Given the current scenario, it seems challenging to reach my outside value with the available items without severely downgrading what Player 1 has offered.

The discount factor means that if I prolong negotiations, the value of an accepted offer will decrease by a factor of 0.9.\n\n### Assess the Value of Offers\n1. **There is no current offer** from Player 2 as of now, so I can't evaluate an existing offer.\n2. **Potential counteroffers**:\n   - I need to devise an offer where my retained value exceeds my outside offer value of 55 or justifies continuing negotiations considering the discount.\n   - Let's check a possible division that keeps my total value above 55:\n\n   Consider offering Player 2:\n   - 3 units of item 2\n   - 1 unit of item 3\n   - 2 units of item 4\n   - 3 units of item 5\n\n   My retained items after this potential offer would be:\n   - 3 units of item 1\n   - 5 units of item 2\n   - 1 unit of item 3\n   - 3 units of item 4\n   - 1 unit of item 5\n\n   Calculating the value for my retained items:\n   - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n   - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 2 = 10\n   - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n   - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n   - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n   \n   Total retained value = 12 + 10 + 9 + 15 + 2 = 48\n\n   The retained value is 48 which is below my outside offer of 55 after considering my proposal, indicating a need to adjust the division to maximize the retained value.\n\n### Make a Decision\nSince 48 is less than the outside offer of 55 after adjusting once, I need a better counteroffer strategy or I risk ending lower than my outside offer. Let me try maximizing the retained value for a better strategy.\n\nOffering Player 2:\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy retained items after this offer would be:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nCalculating the value for my retained items again:\n- Item 1: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n- Item 2: 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\n- Item 3: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n\nTotal retained value = 12 + 8 + 18 + 15 + 6 = 59\n\n### Decision\nThe retained value of 59 is higher than my outside offer of 55 even after considering the discount in future rounds. Now, I can propose this offer since it gives a total value that is more favorable compared to initially walking away with the outside offer.\n\nLet's proceed with the requested counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a decision, I will evaluate my situation based on the information provided:\n\n1) Current Situation Analysis:\n   - My outside offer value: 18.\n   - Values of the items involved:\n     - Item 1: 1 per unit\n     - Item 2: 1 per unit\n     - Item 3: 3 per unit\n     - Item 4: 8 per unit\n     - Item 5: 5 per unit\n   - Total pool of items: \n     - 3 units of item 1 \n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor (gamma): 0.9. This means the value of negotiation outcomes decreases by 10% each round we delay, if it surpasses the current round.\n\n2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n   - Since there's no current offer from Player 2, I need to consider potential counteroffers.\n   - Let's assess some potential offers I could make, ensuring my total value exceeds 18.\n\nExample counteroffer where I would keep:\n   - Give away 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2.\n   - Calculating the value I keep:\n     - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 1 = 1\n     - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 1 = 1\n     - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 3 = 3\n     - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 8 = 16\n     - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 5 = 10\n     - Total value = 31\n\nThis offer ensures that the value I gain (31) is significantly higher than my outside offer of 18. As I am the first to propose, I aim to keep my value high enough to be preferable over my outside offer.\n\n3) Decision:\n   - I will make a counteroffer as my value of 31 is acceptable, being significantly above my outside offer of 18.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 120. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 99 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Before we decide on an action, let's evaluate the situation:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 120.\n   - **Values of the items:**\n     - Item 1: 10 per unit\n     - Item 2: 4 per unit\n     - Item 3: 9 per unit\n     - Item 4: 4 per unit\n     - Item 5: 6 per unit\n   - **Total pool of items:** \n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 9 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor:** 0.9. This means the value will be discounted in subsequent rounds, making earlier resolutions preferable.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   Since this is the first round and there has been no offer made by Player 2, let's consider what I should initially offer to Player 2.\n\n   My goal is to maximize my units but ensure the total value is above my outside offer of 120. \n\n   - Let's consider an offer such that I keep more units of items that are higher in value to me:\n     - Proposed offer to Player 2: [1, 1, 4, 1, 2]\n       - I keep: [3, 2, 5, 1, 3]\n\n     Value calculation:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 9 = 45\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n     - Total value to me = 105\n\n   My current offer value (105) is less than my outside offer of 120. Let's increase my possession of units to increase the value.\n\n   New proposed offer to Player 2: [1, 1, 3, 1, 2]\n   - I keep: [3, 2, 6, 1, 3]\n\n   Value calculation:\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 30\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 8\n   - 6 units of item 3 = 54\n   - 1 unit of item 4 = 4\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 18\n   - Total value to me = 114 \n\n   We're still under 120. Let's make one final adjustment:\n\n   Proposed offer to Player 2: [1, 0, 3, 1, 2]\n   - I keep: [3, 3, 6, 1, 3]\n\n   Value calculation:\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 30\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 12\n   - 6 units of item 3 = 54\n   - 1 unit of item 4 = 4\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 18\n   - Total value to me = 118\n\n   Still trying to maximize and close to my outside offer, I will consider further reducing what I give on the high-value item 3:\n\n   Final offer proposal to consider going over 120:\n   Proposed offer to Player 2: [1, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n   - I keep: [3, 3, 7, 1, 3]\n\n   Value calculation:\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 30\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 12\n   - 7 units of item 3 = 63\n   - 1 unit of item 4 = 4\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 18\n   - Total value to me = 127\n\n3) **Decision:** \n\nThe offer potentially provides me a total value of 127, which surpasses my outside offer of 120. This negotiation gives me a better outcome than just relying on the outside offer and is arguably more appealing to end the negotiations early.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 1, 2]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 7. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 93 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 108. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 96 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 4, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 3, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's go through the steps:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** 108\n   - **Values of Items to Me:** \n     - Item 1 = 10\n     - Item 2 = 6\n     - Item 3 = 3\n     - Item 4 = 8\n     - Item 5 = 5\n   - **Total Pool of Items:** \n     - 6 units of item 1\n     - 7 units of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - **Discount Factor Influence:** Since it's round 3, the discount factor is $\\gamma^{2} = 0.9^2 = 0.81$. This means I need to consider my value reduced to 81% of its full value if I make a deal this round.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer Value:**\n     - For me: 6 units of item 1 + 4 units of item 2 + 3 units of item 3 + 2 units of item 4 + 5 units of item 5 remaining.\n     - Value = (6 \u00d7 10) + (4 \u00d7 6) + (3 \u00d7 3) + (2 \u00d7 8) + (5 \u00d7 5)\n     - Value = 60 + 24 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 134\n     - Adjusted by discount: 134 * 0.81 = 108.54\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** 108\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - **Current Offer:** Offers a value slightly above my outside offer (108.54 vs. 108).\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** In the final round, consider if offering fewer items could give me more value. However, any new offer incurs the same discount rate and the potential of Player 2 walking away. Since the current offer matches my fully adjusted value desired in this round, it is reasonable to accept it.\n\n**Action Decision:** Based on the analysis, the current offer gives me a slightly higher value than my outside offer. Therefore, the rational choice is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This is a guaranteed alternative.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 6\n     - Item 2: 5\n     - Item 3: 7\n     - Item 4: 2\n     - Item 5: 2\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor is gamma = 0.9, meaning that if I accept a deal in a later round, the effective value to me is reduced by this factor.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** There is no offer currently on the table.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer that gives me a value greater than or equal to 48 to make it worthwhile compared to my outside option.\n\n   Let's consider keeping the following for myself as a sample counteroffer:\n   - 3 units of item 1 (3 * 6 = 18)\n   - 2 units of item 2 (2 * 5 = 10)\n   - 2 units of item 3 (2 * 7 = 14)\n   - 4 units of item 4 (4 * 2 = 8)\n   - 3 units of item 5 (3 * 2 = 6)\n\n   Total value = 18 + 10 + 14 + 8 + 6 = 56\n\n   In this scenario, Player 2 would get:\n   - 1 unit of item 1\n   - 1 unit of item 2\n   - 1 unit of item 3\n   - 1 unit of item 4\n   - 1 unit of item 5\n\n   This counteroffer gives me a total value of 56, which is better than my outside offer of 48.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Given that my proposed division gives me a value higher than my outside offer, I should make a counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, my action is to propose this counteroffer where Player 2 receives:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

If accepted, my value would be:\n     - Item 1: 1 * 2 = 2\n     - Item 2: 1 * 3 = 3\n     - Item 3: 1 * 3 = 3\n     - Item 4: 1 * 6 = 6\n     - Item 5: 1 * 4 = 4\n     - Total value = 2 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 4 = 18, multiplied by discount factor 0.9 = 16.2\n   - Comparing 16.2 to my outside offer of 47, accepting this offer is not beneficial.\n   - Evaluate a potential counteroffer that is more advantageous than my outside offer:\n     - Example: Propose keeping 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 3 of item 5 for myself (offer 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5 to Player 1).\n     - This gives me a value of:\n       - Item 1: 3 * 2 = 6\n       - Item 2: 2 * 3 = 6\n       - Item 3: 2 * 3 = 6\n       - Item 4: 4 * 6 = 24\n       - Item 5: 3 * 4 = 12\n       - Total value = 6 + 6 + 6 + 24 + 12 = 54, multiplied by discount factor 0.9 = 48.6\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Accepting is worse than my outside offer, and the current offer yields significantly less value (16.2 compared to 48.6 from the potential counteroffer evaluation).\n   - Walking away gives me 47, but a counteroffer that could give me more than my outside offer, even after discounting, is preferable.\n\nTherefore, I will propose a counteroffer that improves my utility beyond 47. \n\nCounteroffer: Offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

Since we are in round 1, the discount does not apply yet, but it will reduce the value of any outcome by 10% in the subsequent rounds. \n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer value:** None, since there's no current offer from Player 2.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** We need to propose an initial division and evaluate if it\u2019s better than my outside offer.\n\n   Let's consider keeping the items that I value most:\n\n   For example, let's keep all item 1 and item 5 (which are most valuable to me), and see the value:\n\n   - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n   - Give away all items of type 2 (5 units).\n   - Total value if keeping item 1 and 5: 9 + 30 = 39\n   \n   This is low, so I may need to adjust further. Our outside offer is very high, I need to either keep a striking balance elsewhere or walk.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - **Accept:** N/A\n   - **Walk:** Not yet, evaluate a balanced initial counteroffer.\n   - **Counteroffer:** \n\n     Since my outside offer is 78, significantly high compared to achievable initial values without fully hoarding all items, which is impractical in negotiations. An alternative, striking a better balance, could involve optimizing returns across item 1 and item 5. Let's try:\n\n     Keeping 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2 and all of item 5 gives:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 9\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 8\n     - 3 unit of item 5 = 30\n     Total = 47\n\n  However, if the remainder of scenario to other player also isn\u2019t favorable while maintaining self value as 78, a closer point is necessary. Since keeping all of item 1 and 5 is indeed favorable but doesn't reach 78 individually, counteroffering lessening grip on item 2 might be a more mutual adherent. Thus:\n\nLet's initialize with trying:\n\n     - Give all of item 2 = [5 units]\n     - Keep all of item 1 = [1 unit]\n     - Keep all of item 5 = [3 unit]\n\nCalculating counteroffer:\n\n   - Offers from my hold to the counterparty would instead align lesser incentives comparatively.\n\nGiven these evaluations, let's propose:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 0, 2]}\n```\n\nGiving player 2 four units of item 2, and two units of item 5, while I retain item 1 and higher amount of item 5 as an initial balance approach.",

However, considering it's not higher by a substantial margin and factoring future discounted rounds, an immediate acceptance might lack strategic benefit if better terms can be negotiated.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer provides a value of 32 which is slightly above my outside offer of 31.\n   - Given that it's only the first round and there could be room for negotiation, I will propose a counteroffer that aims to increase my total value while still being appealing enough for Player 1 to consider.\n\nMy counteroffer will be:\n- I will propose to offer Player 1: [0, 3, 0, 0, 1] (keeping more units for myself).\n\nThis means I will keep for myself:\n- 1 unit of item 2 instead of 0, which adds 6 more to my value.\n- 2 units of item 5 instead of 1, maintaining the same value of 8.\n\nThus, my revised value with this counteroffer is:\n- 1 units of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n- Total value = 4 + 12 + 8 = 24\n\nSorry, I made a mistake.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### 1) Analyzing the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 3.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 4 per unit\n  - Item 2: 2 per unit\n  - Item 3: 7 per unit\n  - Item 4: 8 per unit\n  - Item 5: 10 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 8 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: The discount factor gamma of 0.9 implies that the value decreases in subsequent rounds. It is crucial to achieve a favorable deal early to avoid this depreciation.\n\n### 2) Assessing the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Accepting Offer**: There is no current offer on the table.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - I must propose a counteroffer ensuring my retained items yield a total value greater than my outside offer. \n\n### Calculating a Balanced Division:\n\nLet's consider keeping a greater share of higher-value items to maximize my value. I'll propose the following division:\n\n- Offering Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 1 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\n**My Retained Items**:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n- 5 units of item 2 (8 total - 3 given) = 5 \u00d7 2 = 10\n- 3 units of item 3 (5 total - 2 given) = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n- 3 units of item 4 (4 total - 1 given) = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n- 3 units of item 5 (5 total - 2 given) = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n\n**Total Value of Retained Items**:\n- 8 + 10 + 21 + 24 + 30 = 93\n\n### 3) Decision:\n\nThis offer provides a significant value of 93, significantly higher than my outside offer of 3. My strategy is to retain most high-value items for myself while still proposing a reasonable division to Player 2. \n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

With gamma = 0.9, outcomes in future rounds are multiplied by the discount factor raised to the power of (r-1).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current offer**: There is no current offer from Player 2, so evaluating the value of an offer is not applicable at this moment.\n- **Potential counteroffers**: I will explore a few potential divisions to maximize my value.\n  \n  **Counteroffer Idea**: Keep maximal value items to myself and offer less valuable items to Player 2. Additionally, ensuring the total value surpasses my outside offer value (47) is crucial.\n  \n  Possible counteroffer:\n  - Offer Player 2: \n    - 3 units of item 1\n    - 0 units of item 2\n    - 2 units of item 3\n    - 1 unit of item 4\n    - 1 unit of item 5\n\n  **Value Calculation for Myself**:\n  - I keep 3 units of item 1: 3 * 6 = 18\n  - I keep 0 units of item 2: 0 * 5 = 0\n  - I keep 4 units of item 3: 4 * 6 = 24\n  - I keep 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 5 = 5\n  - I keep 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 3 = 3\n  - Total value = 18 + 0 + 24 + 5 + 3 = 50\n\nComparing this 50 to my outside offer value of 47, this counteroffer would yield a higher immediate value. While negotiating, the discount factor suggests waiting might reduce the benefit I get through the negotiations.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision based on the analysis\n\n- I cannot accept any offer from Player 2 as none has been made.\n- Walking away is suboptimal as my potential counteroffers seem to exceed my outside offer.\n- Proposing a counteroffer appears advantageous.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will propose the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

In the first round, the value is not discounted, but the more rounds that pass, the more critical timing becomes for maximizing returns.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is currently no offer on the table.\n   - Consider potential counteroffers: I need to propose a division of items that provides me a value greater than my outside offer value of 96 and make it attractive enough for Player 2 to consider.\n   - A reasonable offer to evaluate could involve retaining the highest value items for myself.

I need to adjust my offer to exceed my outside offer value. Thus, let's reevaluate and make a more favorable offer for myself.\n   - Reassess holding more of item 2 or item 4 (high value to me) and exclude lower value item units, like some item 3 or item 1.  \n   - I'll optimize my counteroffer to maximize my value above 96.\n\nAdjusting my counteroffer accordingly, I propose the following division for Player 2:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 4 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nHere's my new calculation for what I keep:\n- Item 1: 5 x 3 = 15\n- Item 2: 3 x 6 = 18\n- Item 3: 4 x 2 = 8\n- Item 4: 4 x 7 = 28\n- Item 5: 1 x 5 = 5\n- Total value = 15 + 18 + 8 + 28 + 5 = 74\n\nThis new calculation reveals a flaw in comparison to value maximization, so I will counter with:\n\nReturning to original optimized values:\n- I will keep 4 units of item 1 (12)\n- I will keep 3 units of item 2 (18)\n- I will keep 5 units of item 3 (10)\n- I will keep 2 units of item 4 (14)\n- I will keep 1 unit of item 5 (5)\n- Total: 59\n\nReiterate my calculation which now represents miscalculation under principal expectation that left 4 item 3 units \n\nRetesting:\n\nKeeping more optimal group values \n\n- Item Realized Proposal:\n- Would be declined.\n\nI need a better solution or alternative.\n\nTherefore, I'll counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 5, 1]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 24. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 63 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 5, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 5, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's analyze the current situation step-by-step.\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n- My outside offer value is 24.\n- My values for the items are:\n  - Item 1: 5\n  - Item 2: 9\n  - Item 3: 1\n  - Item 4: 1\n  - Item 5: 5\n- The total pool of items is:\n  - Item 1: 5 units\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 7 units\n  - Item 4: 8 units\n  - Item 5: 3 units\n- The discount factor, gamma = 0.9, influences the value of the negotiation outcome if delayed. Currently, we are in round 1, so there is no discount applied yet, but in later rounds, the value will be multiplied by a discount if we prolong the negotiation.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- Current offer: [0, 0, 2, 5, 1]\n  - Value from current offer = (0 \u00d7 5) + (0 \u00d7 9) + (2 \u00d7 1) + (5 \u00d7 1) + (1 \u00d7 5)\n  - = 0 + 0 + 2 + 5 + 5\n  - = 12\n\n- Compare the current offer to my outside offer value of 24. The current offer (value 12) is significantly below my outside offer value.\n\n- Consider potential counteroffers. A good counteroffer should provide me a value greater than 24 to make it more favorable than my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nI should reject the current offer because its value (12) is much lower than my outside offer value (24).\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that gives me more than the outside offer value. A potential counteroffer could be something like keeping more high-value items for myself. For example, I could propose a counteroffer such as:\n\n- Offer to Player 1: [2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n  - What I keep: [3, 1, 4, 5, 1]\n\nNow let's calculate the value of what I propose to keep:\n  - Value of counteroffer I keep = (3 \u00d7 5) + (1 \u00d7 9) + (4 \u00d7 1) + (5 \u00d7 1) + (1 \u00d7 5)\n  - = 15 + 9 + 4 + 5 + 5\n  - = 38\n\nThe value of this counteroffer (38) is above my outside offer value (24).\n\nThus, based on this reasoning, I will propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 3, 3, 2]}\n```",

Here\u2019s a potential counteroffer calculation:\n\n**Considering a counteroffer where I aim for at least 75 value:**\n- Let's try offering a division such as [4, 3, 2, 1, 2] to Player 1:\n  - For myself: [4, 4, 2, 2, 3]\n    - Item 1: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 1 = 4\n    - Item 2: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n    - Item 3: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n    - Item 4: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n    - Item 5: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n    - **Total value** = 4 + 24 + 14 + 4 + 21 = 67\n  - This proposed counteroffer still does not reach the required value of 75. Continuing this line of customization, let's use:\n\n- Revised try: offer [3, 1, 1, 0, 2] (leaving me with [5, 6, 3, 3, 3])\n  - Item 1: 5 \u00d7 1 = 5\n  - Item 2: 6 \u00d7 6 = 36\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n  - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n  - **New Total Value** = 5 + 36 + 21 + 6 + 21 = 89\n\n- This new counteroffer gives me a total value of 89, which exceeds my outside offer value of 75.\n\nGiven these calculations:\n\n- **Decision**: Let's propose a counteroffer which provides me a higher value than what is being offered.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

In round 3, the present value is already diminished by the factor since it's applied as \\( \\gamma^{2} = 0.9^{2} = 0.81 \\).\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers**:\n   - Current offer to me is [3, 2, 1, 0, 1]:\n     - item 1: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n     - item 2: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - item 3: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n     - item 4: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n     - item 5: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n     - Total value = 6 + 8 + 2 + 0 + 7 = 23\n\n   - The adjusted value for current offer with discount factor = 23 \u00d7 0.81 = 18.63\n   \n   - This current value (18.63) is less than my outside offer value of 41.\n\n3) **Make a Decision**:\n   - Given that the value I would receive from accepting the offer (18.63) is much less than my outside offer (41), it is not advantageous to accept this offer.\n   - In the last round, the best strategic decision here is to walk away since any counteroffer now cannot provide a present value (given the discount) greater than my outside offer.\n\nHence, the best decision is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 114. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 84 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

In this first round, no discount is applied.\n\n2) Assessing the value of offers:\n   - I need to make an initial offer since there is no current offer on the table. My main goal is to ensure my allocated items have a value greater than 114, my outside offer, adjusted by any applicable discount, although in round 1 there is none.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - I will propose a reasonable counteroffer to make sure that my remaining value surpasses my outside option. Let me calculate a suitable counteroffer.\n\nLet's split the items in a way that should maximize my value:\n   - If I propose giving Player 2 one unit of each item (except item 4), I retain the highest value items for myself.\n   Proposed division: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (giving Player 2 some portions)\n\n   - My remaining items and value:\n     - Items I keep: [2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 7 of item 4, 7 of item 5]\n     - Calculated value:\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n       - 7 units of item 4 = 7 \u00d7 9 = 63\n       - 7 units of item 5 = 7 \u00d7 8 = 56\n     - Total value = 146 (which is greater than my outside offer of 114).\n\nThis proposed method ensures that I surpass my outside option value, and I'm retaining most value-dense options. Therefore, it would be prudent to make this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 0, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 0, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

Since 70 < 108, I should not accept the current offer.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Should I accept the current offer? No, since the value of 70 is lower than my outside offer.\n   - Should I walk away and take my outside offer now? Not yet, as I have room to negotiate.\n   - Should I propose a specific counteroffer? Yes, let's calculate:\n\n   Let's try offering Player 1 fewer units of higher-value items to me while keeping it attractive enough for them:\n   - Counteroffer: [2, 2, 2, 3, 0] (where I give them 2, 2, 2, 3, 0).\n       - My remaining items: [3, 4, 3, 3, 1] (items I keep)\n       - Calculate the value to me:\n         - Item 1: 3 units = 3 * 6 = 18\n         - Item 2: 4 units = 4 * 9 = 36\n         - Item 3: 3 units = 3 * 2 = 6\n         - Item 4: 3 units = 3 * 5 = 15\n         - Item 5: 1 unit = 1 * 2 = 2\n         - Total value = 18 + 36 + 6 + 15 + 2 = 77\n\n   The counteroffer's value (77) is still less than my outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 23. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 93 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

In round 1, this doesn't affect the decision significantly in terms of value adjustment.\n\n2) **Value Assessment:**\n   - **Current Offer (for me): [0, 0, 3, 2, 2]**\n     - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 7 = 0\n     - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 4 = 0\n     - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 3 = 9\n     - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 9 = 18\n     - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20\n     - **Total Value = 47**\n   - Compare this against my outside offer of 60.

Let's try offering Player 1 lesser portions, ensuring I get an optimal value.\n\n   - If I aim for:\n     - 0 units of Item 1 to Player 1 (2 to me \u2192 14 value)\n     - 2 units of Item 2 to Player 1 (2 to me \u2192 8 value)\n     - 2 units of Item 3 to Player 1 (2 to me \u2192 6 value)\n     - 0 units of Item 4 to Player 1 (2 to me \u2192 18 value)\n     - 2 units of Item 5 to Player 1 (3 to me \u2192 30 value)\n\n   Total for me = 14 + 8 + 6 + 18 + 30 = 76, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, the counteroffer I wish to propose Player 1 is:\n   - Offer Player 1: [0, 2, 2, 0, 2]\n\nThis gives me an overall value of 76, which is acceptable.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If agreement is not reached in this round, the value diminishes as it will be multiplied by gamma to the power of (r-1), where r is the round number.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Current offer: None, as it is the first round.\n   - Potential counteroffers: Since there is no current offer, let's evaluate potential offers and aim to exceed my outside offer value of 4 significantly.\n\n   Let's create a counteroffer that maximizes my value by proposing to keep more of the higher value items (items 2, 3, and 4):\n\n   Proposed Offer to Player 2:\n   - Give Player 2: [6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5]\n   \n   My Value from keeping:\n   - Item 1: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n   - Item 2: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n   - Item 3: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n   - Item 4: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n   - Item 5: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n   - Total value = 6 + 15 + 8 + 36 + 4 = 69\n\n   The offer gives me a total value of 69, which is much greater than my outside offer value of 4.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Since the value of my proposed division exceeds my outside offer value and offers a strong starting position, I will proceed with this counteroffer.\n   \nHere is my action formatted as required:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 3, 1, 2, 3]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 20. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 69 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 4, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 4, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we're in round 2, the value of accepting an offer this round is not discounted.\n\nNext, assess the value of offers:\n\n1) **Value of Current Offer:**\n   - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 9 = 0\n   - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\n   - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 2 = 6\n   - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 1 = 2\n   - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 3 = 12\n   - Total value: 0 + 9 + 6 + 2 + 12 = 29\n\n2) **Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n   - The current offer provides me with a value of 29, which is greater than my outside offer of 20.\n\n3) Evaluate potential counteroffers:\n   - To get more value than 29, I would need to propose a division that gives me an even higher total value. However, since the current offer is already above my outside offer and satisfactory, renegotiating (risking it) may not be necessary.\n\nBased on the analysis, it is optimal to accept the current offer as it gives me more value (29) than my outside option (20). Moreover, trying to negotiate further could result in a lower outcome due to the discounting in future rounds or the possibility of having to walk.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to:\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

I want a total value from keeping items that is more advantageous than my outside option, while ensuring Player 2 finds my counteroffer reasonable enough to accept.\n\nA potential counteroffer could be:  \n- Offer Player 2 [2, 0, 2, 0, 2], which gives me:\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n  - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n  - Total value = 81\n  - Discounted value = 81 \u00d7 0.9 = 72.9\n\nUnfortunately, the counteroffer I've calculated provides a discounted value slightly below 80, which doesn't satisfy my requirement of exceeding my outside offer. I need to further recalibrate.\n\nAdjusting that offer to [1, 0, 2, 0, 2], however lets me keep:\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 36\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 8\n  - 5 units of item 3 = 20\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 24\n  - Total value = 90\n  - Discounted value = 90 \u00d7 0.9 = 81\n\nThis satisfies my requirement since the offer meets the requirement of fitting over my outside offer within the discount factor. \n\nTherefore, I can make a counteroffer as follows: \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]}\n```",

This means we need an intrinsic value greater than \\( \\frac{65}{0.81} \\approx 80.25 \\).\n\n     - Example counteroffer: [3, 0, 3, 0, 3] (offering Player 1 these units)\n       - My share would be:\n         - Item 1: 5 - 3 = 2 units = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n         - Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n         - Item 3: 7 - 3 = 4 units = 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n         - Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2 units = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n         - Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2 units = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n       - Total value: 18 + 6 + 28 + 12 + 14 = 78\n       - Adjusted for round 3: 78 \u00d7 0.81 = 63.18\n\n   Clearly, even this potentially valuable split does not meet my outside offer of 65 after applying the discount. By further reducing my offer:\n\n   - Example counteroffer: [3, 0, 2, 0, 3]\n     - My share would be:\n       - Item 1: 5 - 3 = 2 units = 18\n       - Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1 unit = 6\n       - Item 3: 7 - 2 = 5 units = 35\n       - Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2 units = 12\n       - Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2 units = 14\n     - Total value: 18 + 6 + 35 + 12 + 14 = 85\n     - Adjusted for round 3: 85 \u00d7 0.81 = 68.85\n\n   This counteroffer provides a value greater than my outside offer, making it a feasible alternative.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Since the adjusted value of the current offer (36.45) is less than my outside offer (65), I should not accept it.\n   - The potential counteroffer option, providing an adjusted value greater than my outside offer, is better.\n   - Therefore, I will make a counteroffer, as it's the final round before WALKing.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 0, 3]}\n```",

Here's my consideration for a counteroffer:\n\n   - My hypothetical division:\n     - Keep 0 units of item 1 (value = 0)\n     - Keep 2 units of item 2 (value = 2 * 4 = 8)\n     - Keep 0 units of item 3 (value = 0)\n     - Keep 3 units of item 4 (value = 3 * 3 = 9)\n     - Keep 0 units of item 5 (value = 0)\n\n   - Total value if I keep these: 0 (item 1) + 8 (item 2) + 0 (item 3) + 9 (item 4) + 0 (item 5) = 17\n\n   This value (17) does not exceed my outside offer value of 54, hence I shouldn't make a major concession.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Since I must make the first move, I have to construct a counteroffer that provides me at least equal or more value than the outside offer, or I have to walk away. Keeping most value for me, such counteroffer should be designed accordingly.\n\nGiven that my outside offer is higher, it is critical to propose an offer that gives more value from retained items. However, since my outside offer is quite high, I am better off making large claims:\n\n- Offer a minimalistic counter-offer for the other player to consider it as a starting point, knowing I have a very strong alternative.\n\nCounteroffer:\n   - Offer 3 units of item 1\n   - Offer 5 units of item 2\n   - Offer 2 units of item 3\n   - Offer 2 units of item 4\n   - Offer 3 units of item 5\n\nTherefore, the offer I give player 2 is:\n   - [3, 5, 2, 2, 3]\n\nThis would maximize my potential gain from staying in the negotiation compared to walking away and potentially initiating a positive negotiation dynamic with Player 2 by making them counter rather than walk initially as well.

The current offer gives me a present value of 18, which is quite substantial when considering my outside option.\n   - Should I walk away and take my outside offer? No, since my outside offer value of 4 is significantly less.\n   - Should I propose a specific counteroffer?

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's go through the analysis step-by-step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 76.\n   - The values of the items to me are:\n     - Item 1: 10 per unit\n     - Item 2: 6 per unit\n     - Item 3: 8 per unit\n     - Item 4: 4 per unit\n     - Item 5: 8 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is: \n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor influences the negotiation by potentially reducing the value of future rounds (since this is round 2, discount factor is \\(0.9^{1} = 0.9\\)).\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer I am offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]:\n     - Value for item 1: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n     - Value for item 2: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n     - Value for item 3: 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n     - Value for item 4: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n     - Value for item 5: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n     - Total value = 10 + 12 + 0 + 4 + 16 = 42\n     - Discounted value = 42 \u00d7 0.9 = 37.8\n   \n   - This current offer yields a discounted value of 37.8, which is significantly lower than my outside offer of 76.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The current offer has a total value far below my outside offer, even after the second round discount.\n   - Walking away with my outside offer yields a higher guaranteed value.\n   - A counteroffer should aim to get over 76 in value after discounting with 0.9, which is not visible here because the current offer's value of 42 cannot be improved enough with tweaks from the initial pool without further understanding player dynamics.\n\nBased on these analyses, it's clear that the current offer isn't satisfactory and proposing a counteroffer that gets to excess of 76 after discount is necessary. However, the provided direction and context lean toward walking away due to securing an immediate higher value. Nevertheless, I will calculate a basic counteroffer attempt:\n\nLet's make a minimal adjustment to see if possible division of the items could reach value. For this, keeping closer to the security mark of an outside offer at 76 is essential. \n\nHere's a potential minimal viable counter division:\n- Offer: [1, 1, 1, 0, 2] (I retain [1, 2, 3, 2, 2])\n\nLet's value these:\n   - Value for item 1: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n   - Value for item 2: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n   - Value for item 3: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n   - Value for item 4: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n   - Value for item 5: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n   - Total value = 10 + 12 + 24 + 8 + 16 = 70\n\nThis totals to only 70; hence we need a bit higher attempt:\nThus actually a longer consideration sets the clear direction, and secureness decide with: \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 93. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 93 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 4, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide my next action, I'll analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 93.\n   - My values for the items are: \n     - Item 1: 5 \n     - Item 2: 7 \n     - Item 3: 8 \n     - Item 4: 2 \n     - Item 5: 9\n   - The total pool of items includes 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9 for Round 2, which implies a multiplier of 0.9 for any deal finalized in this round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer to me: [1, 0, 2, 4, 1]\n     - My value if I accept:\n       - 1 unit of item 1: 5 \u00d7 1 = 5\n       - 0 units of item 2: 7 \u00d7 0 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 3: 8 \u00d7 2 = 16\n       - 4 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n       - 1 unit of item 5: 9 \u00d7 1 = 9\n     - Total value = 5 + 0 + 16 + 8 + 9 = 38\n     - Adjusted for discount: 38 \u00d7 0.9 = 34.2\n\n   - My outside offer is 93, which is higher than the discounted value of 34.2 for the current offer.\n\n3) Decision:\n   - The current offer does not provide enough value, even with the discount factor considered.\n   - Walking away ensures a guaranteed value of 93, which is better than the current offer.\n   - A potential counteroffer needs to result in a value greater than my outside offer when discounted.\n\nConsidering these points, I should provide a counteroffer where I retain a higher value. Let\u2019s evaluate a different division, giving myself a counteroffer value exceeding 93 when adjusted for the discount:\n\n   - If I propose to give Player 2: [1, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n     - I would keep: [2, 1, 2, 3, 3]\n     - My value:\n       - 2 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 2 = 10\n       - 1 unit of item 2: 7 \u00d7 1 = 7\n       - 2 units of item 3: 8 \u00d7 2 = 16\n       - 3 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n       - 3 units of item 5: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27\n     - Total value = 10 + 7 + 16 + 6 + 27 = 66\n     - Adjusted for discount: 66 \u00d7 0.9 = 59.4\n\nGiven the discount-adjusted value of my proposed counteroffer is still not exceeding my outside offer, it doesn't make economic sense. To improve, I need to keep more high-value items or walk away if a viable option isn't possible within these constraints, because any counteroffer that leaves me at a value lower than 93 is not acceptable. Therefore, I will decide to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

I will offer Player 1 a split like [0, 0, 2, 0, 1] where I get [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]:\n\n- My total value for [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n  - Total value = 6 + 4 + 8 + 10 + 6 = 34\n\nEven though 34 is lower, I could try a more aggressive offer since my outside offer is very high. However, I have to consider that the offer should reasonably satisfy Player 1 or bring negotiations closer to my utility, compensating for the discount. Another fair counteroffer could look like [1, 0, 3, 0, 1] leaving [0, 2, 1, 1, 1] for me, with a value of 34:\n\n- My value:\n  - 0 unit of item 1 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 4\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 4\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 10\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 6\n  - Total value = 0 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 6 = 24\n\nThis approach ensures at least a better distribution without offering the direct WALK right away or proposing an offer that is clearly favoring only one side after reinterpretation.\n\nGiven I didn't quite reach above my outside value with the first reasonable try, and the remaining offers, or splitting further still tend to not reach directly 45, going back:\n\nI'll respond with {\"action\": \"WALK\"} since my outside offer clearly remains quite high compared to plausible in-discussion adjustments Player 1 might also concur upon.",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make my decision, I'll step through the analysis:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 49.\n   - The values of the items to me are: \n     - Item 1: 2 per unit\n     - Item 2: 7 per unit\n     - Item 3: 5 per unit\n     - Item 4: 9 per unit\n     - Item 5: 5 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is: 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   - The discount factor, gamma = 0.9, influences the negotiation value because the value is multiplied by gamma^(r-1), where r is the round number. We are in round 2, so the value is multiplied by 0.9.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer [3, 0, 0, 3, 0] implies that I receive 0 units of item 2, item 3, and item 5:\n     - Total value to me if I accept: \n       * (3 units of item 1 * 2 value) + (0 units of item 2 * 7 value) + (0 units of item 3 * 5 value) +\n         (3 units of item 4 * 9 value) + (0 units of item 5 * 5 value)\n       * = 6 + 0 + 0 + 27 + 0 = 33\n     - Adjusted for round 2 (33 * 0.9) = 29.7\n   - This adjusted value (29.7) is less than my outside offer value (49).\n\n3) Decision:\n   - The current offer gives me an adjusted value of 29.7, which is less than my outside offer of 49.\n   - Thus, I should not accept the current offer because my outside offer is more valuable.\n\nNow let's consider a counteroffer more beneficial than the outside offer:\n   - Let's propose receiving 2 units of item 2 and 2 units of item 4 (which are most valuable to me):\n     - Value to me if receiving 1 each of item 1, item 3, item 5 and 2 of items 2 and 4:\n       * (1 unit of item 1 * 2 value) + (2 units of item 2 * 7 value) + (1 unit of item 3 * 5 value) +\n         (2 units of item 4 * 9 value) + (1 unit of item 5 * 5 value)\n       * = 2 + 14 + 5 + 18 + 5 = 44\n     - Adjusted for round 2 (44 * 0.9) = 39.6\n   - This total is still less than the outside offer; let's strive for more of high-value items:\n     - 0 units item 1, 1 unit item 2, 3 unit item 3, 3 units item 4, 0 unit item 5 (leaving other items entirely to Player 2):\n       * 0 + 7 + 15 + 27 + 0 = 49\n     - Rounds adjustment yields 44.1.\n     - This remains less beneficial than the outside offer. Attempt something bolder:\n\nReversing strategy, focusing key valuable items:\n  \nOffer: Giving Player 2 [0 units, 0 units, 1 unit, 2 units, 1 unit] \u2013 keeping more of items 4 and 5 for final grander valuation:\n   - Meaning: I get 3 units of item 1 and 2 of items 2 and 3 at my discretion:\n     * (3 unit of item 1 * 2 value) + (2 units of item 2 * 7 value) + (2 unit of item 3 * 5 value) +\n       (1 unit of item 4 * 9 value) + (1 unit of item 5 * 5 value)\n     * = 6 + 14 + 10 + 9 + 5 = 44\n  - Adjusting for this round (44 * 0.9) gives 39.6. Not optimal necessarily but little better in value holding.\n\nUltimately faced issues hitting 49+:\n\nThus, confident in overriding value drawback ideally, opting to revert full value commitment to my alternative:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

However, since it is currently round 1, the discount factor does not affect the current calculation.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Current offer on the table ([0, 0, 0, 3, 1]) means I receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   - Calculating the total value of the current offer:\n     - Value from 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n     - Value from 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n     - Value from 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n     - Value from 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n     - Value from 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n     - Total value = 9 + 9 = 18\n\n   - This value of 18 is significantly lower than my outside offer value of 76.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Should I accept the current offer? No, because the total value (18) is much less than my outside offer (76).\n   - Should I walk away?

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 84.\n   - **Values of the Items:**\n     - Item 1: 9 per unit\n     - Item 2: 5 per unit\n     - Item 3: 8 per unit\n     - Item 4: 1 per unit\n     - Item 5: 8 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:** \n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor is 0.9. Since we're in round 2, the value of this round's outcome will be multiplied by \\(0.9^{1} = 0.9\\).\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer to Me: [0, 0, 1, 3, 3]:**\n     - Value from item 3: \\(1 \\times 8 = 8\\)\n     - Value from item 4: \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\)\n     - Value from item 5: \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\)\n     - Total Value = \\(8 + 3 + 24 = 35\\)\n     - Adjusted Value with discount = \\(35 \\times 0.9 = 31.5\\)\n\n3) **Compare to Outside Offer:**\n   - My outside offer provides a value of 84. The current offer gives me a value of 31.5, which is significantly lower than my outside offer of 84.\n\n4) **Consider Potential Counteroffers:**\n   - To achieve a value close to or exceeding 84, considering the discount, I need to aim for a total of at least \\( \\frac{84}{0.9} \\approx 93.33 \\) before the discount.\n   - Testing different allocations:\n\n     Let's try keeping a higher value of item 1, since it is the most valuable to me:\n\n     - If I keep 4 units of item 1, and propose [0, 1, 1, 3, 4] for Player 2:\n       - My value calculation:\n         - 4 units of item 1: \\(4 \\times 9 = 36\\)\n         - 0 units of item 2: \\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\)\n         - 0 units of item 3: \\(0 \\times 8 = 0\\)\n         - 0 units of item 4: \\(0 \\times 1 = 0\\)\n         - 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\)\n       - Total value = \\(36 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 16 = 52\\)\n       - Adjusted value with discount = \\(52 \\times 0.9 = 46.8\\), which is still below 84.\n\n   - After reevaluating based on the item distribution and values, none of the configurations compare favorably to my outside option without heavily disadvantaging Player 2.\n\n5) **Final Decision:**\n   - Given that even an adjusted counteroffer would not approach the value of my outside offer sufficiently under the discount factor, it makes the most sense to WALK away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 33. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 33. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 72 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 4, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 4, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's break down the situation step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 33.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 5/unit\n  - Item 2: 1/unit\n  - Item 3: 9/unit\n  - Item 4: 6/unit\n  - Item 5: 3/unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 7 units of item 2\n  - 8 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This affects the value of future rounds; each future round is discounted by a factor of 0.9^(r-1). As this is round 1, the discount is not yet applied, but it will be significant if negotiations continue.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: [3, 3, 4, 1, 2] (offered to me)\n  - Value Calculation:\n    - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n    - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n    - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n    - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n    - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n    - Total Value = 15 + 3 + 36 + 6 + 6 = 66\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**: The current offer provides a total value of 66, which is greater than my outside offer value of 33. \n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Accept the Current Offer**: The current offer of 66, not affected by yet discount as this is round 1, is significantly higher than my outside offer of 33. Accepting the current offer maximizes my value without risking the uncertainties of future negotiations.\n- **Walk**: Walking away would yield me a value of only 33 from my outside offer.\n- **Counteroffer**: Since the current offer is already significantly favorable compared to my outside offer, a counteroffer isn't necessary here, as it might prompt Player 1 to withdraw or renegotiate unfavorably.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the best course of action is to accept the current offer. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

I will offer Player 1 the following [7, 1, 1, 4, 2]:\n\n   My counteroffer calculation for myself:\n   - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 1 = 2\n   - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\n   - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20\n   - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 2 = 6\n   - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20\n   - Total value: 2 + 9 + 20 + 6 + 20 = 57 (This doesn't exceed my outside value, I should consider a different distribution)\n\n   Let me revise my counteroffer such that I maximize my value better: I will now offer [8, 2, 2, 6, 3] to Player 1 and calculate what I receive:\n   - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 1 = 1\n   - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 9 = 0\n   - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 10 = 10\n   - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 2 = 2\n   - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 10 = 10\n   - Total value: 1 + 0 + 10 + 2 + 10 = 23 (This is even worse than before, let me offer something better earlier)\n\nUnfortunately, my earlier attempts at calculating my counter offer didn't manage to exceed 59. But continuing to ur right now isn't possible I will still pursue one counteroffer and that should be: [6, 0, 0, 3, 2].\n   Final counteroffer calculation for myself (previous offer now): \n   - Item 1: 3 unit \u00d7 1 = 3\n   - Item 2: 2 unit \u00d7 9 = 18\n   - Item 3: 3 unit \u00d7 10 = 30\n   - Item 4: 4 unit \u00d7 2 = 8\n   - Item 5: 2 unit \u00d7 10 = 20\n   - Total value: 3 + 18 + 30 + 8 + 20 = 79 (This exceeds my outside offer considerably, offering a revised healthy outcome)\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 0, 0, 3, 2]}",

Therefore, accepting this offer is not favorable.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n- **Accept the current offer?** No, because its value (25) is much less than my outside offer (56).\n- **Walk away and take my outside offer?** This is an option if a counteroffer cannot achieve at least a value of 56.\n- **Propose a counteroffer?** Yes, propose a counteroffer that exceeds or matches the value of 56.\n\nLet's construct a counteroffer:\n- To achieve a higher total than my outside offer, I'll prioritize high-value items and offer fewer of them.\n- I propose to keep more units of high-value items for myself (such as item 2 with a value of 9, and item 1 with a value of 7).\n- Example counteroffer where I aim for a value equal to or higher than 56 for myself:\n  - Keep all of item 1 (2 units): 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n  - Keep all of item 2 (3 units): 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n  - Offer all of item 3 (3 units) to Player 1: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n  - Offer item 4 to Player 1: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n  - Offer all of item 5 (3 units) to Player 1: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\n- This strategy gives me (keeping items 1 and 2): 14 (from item 1) + 27 (from item 2) = 41\n- My value from the remainder (items 4 and 5) = 0 since I offered all to Player 1\n\nHowever, reaching 56 exactly considering such constraints might prove difficult, so I may need more units or offer alternate combinations.\n\nLet's finalize the counteroffer:\n- Final offer to Player 1: [0, 0, 3, 1, 3]\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 1, 3]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means an offer should ideally provide value greater than the outside offer of 67 when adjusted for rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   Since there is no current offer, I will consider potential counteroffers:\n   - **Total value without offering anything (keeping all items):**\n     - Item 1: 7 units \u00d7 10 = 70\n     - Item 2: 6 units \u00d7 10 = 60\n     - Item 3: 9 units \u00d7 9 = 81\n     - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 4 = 4\n     - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 8 = 16\n     - Total value = 231\n   - **Compare this with my outside offer of 67:** Keeping all items is significantly higher in value (231) than my outside offer of 67. However, I can't offer 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, as it won't be a valid counteroffer, and offering something close to the minimal outside offer can establish a negotiation baseline.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:** \n   - Given that this is round 1 and there is no initial offer on the table, I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my retained value while being reasonable for negotiation.\n   - A reasonable initial counteroffer could involve giving up the fewest items to maintain a high total value. I will minimize the items I part with, focusing on lower-value items that impact my total value less.\n\nSample counteroffer:\n   - Offer: [1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5]\n   - Retaining: \n     - Item 1: 6 units \u00d7 10 = 60\n     - Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 10 = 50\n     - Item 3: 6 units \u00d7 9 = 54\n     - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 4 = 4\n     - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 8 = 16\n   - Total value = 184\n   - This total value is still significantly above my outside offer of 67.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means if I accept an offer in a future round, my net value from the negotiation is multiplied by this factor for each subsequent round. Therefore, I should prefer a higher total value in earlier rounds or a future offer with considerably higher value to offset the discount.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so I need to consider making an initial offer.\n- **Evaluating Potential Counteroffers:**\n\nI want a counteroffer that provides a value greater than 136 (my outside offer value). Let's consider offering Player 2 three units of each item except item 3, where I will offer two units. This keeps the majority of item 3, which is the most valuable to me.\n\n- My counteroffer: [3, 1, 2, 1, 1] (offering these units to Player 2)\n\n  - Units I keep:\n    - Item 1: 8 - 3 = 5 (value = 5 \u00d7 5 = 25)\n    - Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 (value = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18)\n    - Item 3: 7 - 2 = 5 (value = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50)\n    - Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2 (value = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4)\n    - Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2 (value = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8)\n\n  - Total Value: 25 + 18 + 50 + 4 + 8 = 105\n\nThis value (105) is less than my outside offer (136), meaning it's not a worthwhile offer for me in this context.\n\n### Making a Decision\n\nGiven the initial analysis:\n- The calculated value from the possible counteroffer does not exceed my outside offer.\n- The outside offer is significantly high (136), so any offer needs to surpass this substantially when adjusted with future round discount profits.\n\nGiven there is no standing offer and my potential offers don't provide more value than my outside offer, my strategic move in this round is to start negotiations with a firm stance, as the first initial proposal may set the tone. I will optimize my chance of getting a favorable deal, trying to maintain as much value as possible while considering the discount and future potential offers. Hence, I should provide an initial offer with the aim to reach an agreement better than the outside offer:\n\nHere\u2019s a starting offer:\n\n**Counteroffer** - Offering other player a fair distribution, but trying to keep high-value items:\n\n- Offer to Player 2: [4, 2, 2, 1, 1] (gives them some quantity of each item, retaining the majority of value in item 3).\n\nThis offer prioritizes keeping more high-value items and could potentially dissuade an immediate closure if adjusted appropriately. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

Therefore, securing a high initial offer would be optimal unless I anticipate gaining better terms soon.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There's no current offer to accept.\n   - I need to evaluate potential counteroffers. Suppose I offer different quantities to Player 2 and evaluate what I could receive:\n\n     Let's try some possible allocations where I maximize my value but consider my outside offer value is 14 to be beaten:\n\n     **Offering a majority of less valued items:**\n     - Offer [1, 0, 2, 1, 3] to Player 2 (\"less valued\" mostly refers to item 5):\n       - My kept items:\n         - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n         - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n         - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n         - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n         - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n       - Total value = 15 + 7 + 10 + 8 + 0 = 40\n\n   - The total value of this counteroffer to me is 40, which is better than my outside offer of 14.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Since the calculated value (40) from my counteroffer is significantly higher than my outside offer (14), it makes sense to proceed with this offer.\n\nTherefore, I will propose this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 1, 3]}\n```",

If I can secure a value higher than 51 (my outside offer) or close to it in this round, it is beneficial because in the next round, the value will be discounted by 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer on the Table:** [4, 2, 0, 0, 1]\n     - Value from Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 6 = 24\n     - Value from Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - Value from Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 1 = 0\n     - Value from Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 1 = 0\n     - Value from Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 7 = 7\n     - Total value = 24 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 7 = 39\n     - Adjusted for round 2 discount: 39 \u00d7 0.9 = 35.1\n   - **Comparison to Outside Offer:** 35.1 is significantly lower than my outside offer of 51.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n     - I should aim for a counteroffer which gives me a value higher than 51 when discounted, or pushes Player 1 to make a more favorable offer.\n     - Let's calculate an example counteroffer where I aim to keep a higher value:\n       - My counteroffer could be [3, 1, 0, 1, 3] (I give Player 1 these items).\n       - Remaining for me: [5, 2, 2, 0, 2]\n       - Value for me:\n         - 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 6 = 30\n         - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n         - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n         - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n         - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n         - Total value = 30 + 8 + 2 + 0 + 14 = 54\n         - Adjusted for discount: 54 \u00d7 0.9 = 48.6 (It is getting closer to my outside offer, but still slightly below when discounted.)\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   - The current offer yields a discounted value of 35.1, which is far below my outside offer.\n   - A counteroffer where I aim for a higher value doesn't quite reach my outside offer when discounted, but may push Player 1 to offer more favorable terms next.\n   - Walking will provide a guaranteed 51, higher than any current discounted offer values.\n\nGiven these calculations, I will make a counteroffer to potentially see if the negotiation can end at a higher value for me in the next round:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 0, 1, 3]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

Counteroffers can be even better but are subject to negotiation.\n\n3) **Make a decision**:\n   - The current offer provides a value of 55.8, which is significantly above my outside offer value.\n   - Any potential counteroffer should aim to be higher than this, but there is risk involved as Player 2 might not be inclined to accept.\n   - Accepting the current offer ensures I get a very favorable outcome.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will choose to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

However, my previous calculation showed there could be better than 45.9, like the one which has 60.3 discounted.\n\nGiven the evidence, the best move is to push for a better split that matches or exceeds the better-calculated value by considering a counteroffer\n\n**Counterproposal:** I can propose an offer favoring me more evenly:\n\nLet's counteroffer with [2, 2, 1, 1, 1], which gives:\n\n- My value with this distribution would be calculated as follows:\n  - 3 units of Item 1 (3 remaining) = 18\n  - 3 units of Item 2 (3 remaining) = 24\n  - 1 unit of Item 3  ( one each)   = 3\n  - 2 units of Item 4 (2 remaining) = 14\n  - 1 unit of Item 5  (1) (one each) = 4\n\nProposing them to receive [2, 2, 1, 1, 1], I would essentially be keeping [3, 3, 1, 2, 1], valued at 63 before discount, yielding 56.7 after discount projected to be better.\n\n\nGiven this analysis, a counteroffer makes more sense than acceptance:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

Hence, let's evaluate a counteroffer that maximizes my value:\n     - If I keep 3 items of item 1, 4 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 1 of item 5 (offer [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]), my value would be:\n       - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 10 = 30\n       - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 2 = 8\n       - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\n       - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 8 = 16\n       - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 6 = 6\n     - Total value = 30 + 8 + 9 + 16 + 6 = 69\n     - Discounted value: 69 \u00d7 0.9 = 62.1\n     - Still less than 113.\n\n   - Another option: Keep 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 1 of item 5 (offer [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]), my value would be:\n     - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 10 = 40\n     - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 2 = 6\n     - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\n     - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 8 = 16\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 6 = 6\n     - Total value = 40 + 6 + 9 + 16 + 6 = 77\n     - Discounted value: 77 \u00d7 0.9 = 69.3\n   \n   - This still favors my outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on the best course of action, I will first analyze the current situation and then assess potential actions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 18.\n- **Values of the Items:** \n  - Item 1: 6 per unit\n  - Item 2: 6 per unit\n  - Item 3: 5 per unit\n  - Item 4: 2 per unit\n  - Item 5: 5 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:** \n  - 3 units of Item 1\n  - 2 units of Item 2\n  - 2 units of Item 3\n  - 2 units of Item 4\n  - 2 units of Item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. This will reduce the value of my final value by a factor of 0.9 for each subsequent round after the first if the negotiation prolongs.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer on the table, I will consider making my own offer. I want to ensure the value I receive is higher than my outside offer (18) while leaving room for negotiation.\n\nFirst, let's see what the maximum total value is if I keep all items:\n\n- Total Value if I keep all items:\n\n  \\[\n  (3 \\times 6) + (2 \\times 6) + (2 \\times 5) + (2 \\times 2) + (2 \\times 5) = 18 + 12 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 54\n  \\]\n\nMy goal is to secure a deal worth more than 18 (my outside offer value) at a minimum. I will consider a few potential counteroffers:\n\n#### Potential Offer Configurations:\n1. **Offer 1:** Give Player 2 one unit of each item.\n\n   What I Keep:\n   - Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units \n   - Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit \n   - Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n   - Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n   - Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n\n   Value Calculation:\n   \\[\n   (2 \\times 6) + (1 \\times 6) + (1 \\times 5) + (1 \\times 2) + (1 \\times 5) = 12 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 5 = 30\n   \\]\n   Value > 18, so this is a valid offer to propose.\n\n2. **Offer 2:** Give Player 2 one unit of higher value items, keep more units of lower value items for myself.\n\n   What I Keep:\n   - Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n   - Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n   - Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n   - Item 4: 2 units\n   - Item 5: 2 units\n   \n   Value Calculation:\n   \\[\n   (2 \\times 6) + (1 \\times 6) + (1 \\times 5) + (2 \\times 2) + (2 \\times 5) = 12 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 10 = 37\n   \\]\n   Value > 18, produces a higher total, hence a better starting point.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nI will make Offer 2, which gives higher accumulated value and leaves room for negotiation. The goal is to maximize my total while being fair to encourage an agreement.\n\n**Action:** \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "To decide on the initial action, let's evaluate the situation systematically.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 101.\n- **Value of Items Involved**:\n  - Item 1: 6\n  - Item 2: 3\n  - Item 3: 5\n  - Item 4: 6\n  - Item 5: 3\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 3 units of Item 1\n  - 5 units of Item 2\n  - 7 units of Item 3\n  - 6 units of Item 4\n  - 8 units of Item 5\n- **Impact of Discount Factor**: Since this is the first round, any delay will lead to a discount of 10% in the perceived value of the division under negotiation. This factor emphasizes the importance of making offers that at least maintain our outside offer value while balancing future potential gains.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- Since there is no current offer from Player 2, I need to consider potential counteroffers.\n  \n  **Calculation for Total Value of All Items**:\n  - 3 (Item 1) \u00d7 6 = 18\n  - 5 (Item 2) \u00d7 3 = 15\n  - 7 (Item 3) \u00d7 5 = 35\n  - 6 (Item 4) \u00d7 6 = 36\n  - 8 (Item 5) \u00d7 3 = 24\n  - **Overall Total** = 18 + 15 + 35 + 36 + 24 = 128\n\nOne strategic approach is to offer Player 2 a division that ensures my share's value remains higher than my outside offer, 101. For example:\n\n- Let's evaluate keeping most of the high-value items for myself while still being reasonable. Suppose I propose the following offer to Player 2:\n\n  - Player 2 receives:\n    - 1 unit of Item 1\n    - 2 units of Item 2\n    - 3 units of Item 3\n    - 2 units of Item 4\n    - 3 units of Item 5\n\nCalculating my value based on this proposal:\n\n- My units:\n  - 2 units of Item 1: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n  - 3 units of Item 2: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n  - 4 units of Item 3: 4 \u00d7 5 = 20\n  - 4 units of Item 4: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n  - 5 units of Item 5: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15\n- **Total Value to Me** = 12 + 9 + 20 + 24 + 15 = 80\n\nUnder this proposal, my value is only 80, which is less than my outside offer of 101. Therefore, the offer needs to be adjusted to ensure my value exceeds 101.\n\n### Proposed Counteroffer:\n\n- **Counteroffer**: Adjusting to maintain value higher than 101.\n  - Player 2 receives:\n    - 0 units of Item 1\n    - 1 unit of Item 2\n    - 2 units of Item 3\n    - 1 unit of Item 4\n    - 2 units of Item 5\n\nCalculating my new value based on this counteroffer:\n\n- My units:\n  - 3 units of Item 1: 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n  - 4 units of Item 2: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n  - 5 units of Item 3: 5 \u00d7 5 = 25\n  - 5 units of Item 4: 5 \u00d7 6 = 30\n  - 6 units of Item 5: 6 \u00d7 3 = 18\n- **New Total Value to Me** = 18 + 12 + 25 + 30 + 18 = 103\n\nGiven my calculations, this ensures my value remains above my outside offer of 101.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

Therefore, earlier rounds provide a higher value in comparison to offers in later rounds.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means taking this offer gives me nothing, which is a total value of 0.\n   - My outside offer value is 67, which is significantly better than the current offer.\n   - To make a reasonable counteroffer, I need to ensure that the value I get is greater than my outside offer value. \n\n3) Decision Making:\n   - Accepting the current offer is not beneficial as its value is 0.\n   - Walking away guarantees me a value of 67, which is better than the current offer.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer must be such that the value I receive is greater than 67. \n\nLet's calculate a possible counteroffer where I maintain a value greater than 67:\n\n- A fair division could be to offer the other player 0 units of items 3 and 4, keeping these high-value items for myself, while offering a share in others where I have lower values.\n- Proposed counteroffer: Give Player 1 all units of item 5, which would be 3 units (value to me: 3 x 2 = 6).\n- Keep all remaining items (item 1 = 6 units, item 2 = 4 units, item 3 = 6 units, item 4 = 3 units) for myself.\n\nValue calculation for items I keep in this counteroffer:\n- Item 1: 6 units x 5 value = 30\n- Item 2: 4 units x 9 value = 36\n- Item 3: 6 units x 10 value = 60\n- Item 4: 3 units x 8 value = 24\n- Total: 150\n\nWith this counteroffer, my value remains 150, even after offering all units of item 5.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 58.\n- **Values of Items to Me:**\n  - Item 1: 3 per unit\n  - Item 2: 9 per unit\n  - Item 3: 6 per unit\n  - Item 4: 8 per unit\n  - Item 5: 2 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 4 units of Item 1\n  - 3 units of Item 2\n  - 2 units of Item 3\n  - 5 units of Item 4\n  - 5 units of Item 5\n- **Discount Factor:** In round 1, the discount factor does not influence my decision since it's the first round (gamma to the power of 0 equals 1).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\nThere is currently no offer from Player 2. Therefore, I need to consider what a reasonable counteroffer might look like.\n\nLet's calculate potential counteroffers that give me at least a value of 58, preferably higher to minimize risk:\n\n1. **Counteroffer to maximize my value while ensuring a deal:**\n   - If I propose to give Player 2 less valuable items or fewer units:\n     - Offer Player 2: 2 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 4 units of Item 5.\n     - I keep: 2 units of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5.\n     - My value calculation:\n       - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n       - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n       - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n       - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n       - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n       - Total value = 62\n\nThis proposal gives me a total value of 62, which is higher than my outside offer of 58.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nBased on the above analysis, it is beneficial for me to propose a counteroffer where I receive a total value of 62. This exceeds my outside offer and is strategically advantageous.\n\nGiven this analysis, my chosen action is to make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 2, 4]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

Potential Counteroffer:\n- To make a counteroffer that maximizes my gain over the outside offer:\n  - I should propose a division that gives me more value than the outside offer of 8.\n  - A potential counteroffer to optimize my value while being reasonable would be to maximize high-value items (such as item 4 at value 10).\n\n#### Sample Counteroffer Consideration:\nLet's propose:\n- Maximize high-value items (such as item 4).\n- Propose: [1, 1, 0, 3, 2] to Player 1.\n- Units I would receive: [3, 2, 2, 2, 3]\n\n**Value Calculation** for this counteroffer:\n- Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 2 = 6\n- Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 9 = 18\n- Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 5 = 10\n- Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20\n- Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 2 = 6\n- **Total value**: 6 + 18 + 10 + 20 + 6 = 60\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision:\n- The value of the current offer (41) is much higher than my outside offer (8).\n- However, considering a counteroffer that gives me a higher value (60) would be optimal.\n\nConsidering all factors, my action is to propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value while still being reasonable for negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]}\n```",

Since this is the first round, the future offers will not yet be affected by a discount if accepted.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer to evaluate.\n   - I should consider making a counteroffer where my total value is as close to or greater than my outside offer value of 92, taking into account future discounting if possible.\n\n3) To create a counteroffer, let's calculate potential splits and my values:\n   - Let's propose I get maximum value initially to surpass my outside offer and incentivize Player 2 by leaving them certain items, thus strategizing for a possible agreement:\n\n   Possible counteroffer:\n   - Offer to give Player 2: \n     - 0 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2 (I highly value item 2)\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 7 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n\n   - This leaves me with:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n     - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 8 = 32 \n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0 \n   - Total value to me = 18 + 32 = 50\n\n   Clearly, the proposed division offers a value lower than 92 to me. Let's re-evaluate to improve the offering:\n   - Instead, re-propose giving more of the lower-valued items on my list...\n\nHere is a re-evaluated approach where my value exceeds 92:\n- Revise counteroffer:\n  - Offer to give Player 2:\n    - All item 3 (4 units), all item 4 (7 units), and all item 5 (6 units).\n    - Distribute items 1 and 2 more favorably toward me.\n\n  - Specifically:\n    - Offer = [0, 6, 4, 7, 6]\n    - Value retained:\n      - 3 units of item 1 = 18\n      - 2 units of item 2 = 16\n    - Total retained value = 18 + 16 = 34\n\nGiven the value calculation doesn't reach 92, let's revise further\u2014\nHowever, each attempt needs reasoning for each step.\n\nUltimately, aiming logical balance:\n\nFinally, I need to present a counteroffer ensuring minimal dissatisfaction between outside offer and future offer losses:\n\n- Offering:\n- Continue negotiations subtly, more towards Player 2 agreeing.\n\nDecision: Given repeated logical tests\u2014\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n\nThis negotiation balance necessitates moving towards an unyielding posit unless Player 2 directs offers suitably exceeding inherent limitations based on given utilities and especially due to guaranteed outside guarantee.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 5. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 51 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 1, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on the next action, let's analyze the situation based on the guidance provided:\n\n1) Analyzing the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 25.\n   - The values per unit for the items for me are: \n     - Item 1: 9 \n     - Item 2: 3 \n     - Item 3: 3 \n     - Item 4: 6 \n     - Item 5: 1\n   - The total pool of items is: \n     - 1 unit of item 1,\n     - 5 units of item 2,\n     - 2 units of item 3,\n     - 4 units of item 4,\n     - 4 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means if the negotiation goes to the next round, any potential deal's value will be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n2) Assessing the values:\n   - Current offer from Player 2: [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n      - My value for this offer:\n      - Item 1: 1 unit * 9 = 9\n      - Item 4: 3 units * 6 = 18\n      - Total value = 27\n   - As the current round is the second round, the total value is not subject to a discount yet (only after this round for round 3).\n   - Current offer value compared to my outside offer: 27 vs 25. It's higher than my outside offer.\n\n3) Decision:\n   - The current offer gives me a value of 27, which exceeds my outside offer of 25.\n   - Since the current offer is better than my outside offer and the negotiation could lead to a loss of value if extended to the next round, it is beneficial to accept the current offer.\n\nThus, the action in this step is to accept the current offer, which gives more value than my outside option. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If we continue to round 2, my value is multiplied by 0.9. In round 3, it would be multiplied by 0.81.\n\n2) Assess potential counteroffers:\n   I need to generate a counteroffer that at least equals or exceeds my outside offer value of 84 when considering potential future rounds.\n\n   Let's evaluate some potential divisions:\n   - Option A (keeping most valuable items to me):\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n     Total value = 65\n\n   - Option B (maximize items 4 and some items 2):\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n     - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 9 = 45\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n     Total value = 56\n\n   - Option C (better combination of items):\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n     - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n     Total value = 59\n\nAll of these result in a value lower than my outside offer of 84. Therefore, I need to make a strategic counteroffer that might later on reflect a better value with consideration of player 2's response.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Since the current potential counteroffers do not reach 84 and no offer has been made by Player 2, a reasonable step would be to make a reasonable counteroffer. \n   - I can start by offering the items that are potentially less valuable to me and negotiate upwards.\n\nTentative counteroffer:\n- Give Player 2 more of the lower-value items to me, retaining the highest value items for myself.\n\nCounteroffer:\n- Offer Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n\nThis will assure I retain a part of the most valuable items and attempt to converge towards an agreement, expecting further negotiation.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 2, 3]}",
