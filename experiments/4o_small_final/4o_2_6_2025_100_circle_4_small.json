Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 27. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 27. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 87 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 42. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 87 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 3, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 3, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's proceed with the step-by-step decision-making process:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 42.\n   - My values for each item type are:\n     - Item 1: 4 per unit\n     - Item 2: 7 per unit\n     - Item 3: 10 per unit\n     - Item 4: 1 per unit\n     - Item 5: 7 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is: \n     - 7 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n   - The discount factor influences the value of accepting the offer versus waiting. Given the discount factor \u03b3 = 0.9, the value of the negotiation outcome will be multiplied by \u03b3 to the power (r-1). But since we are in round 1, this does not affect the current offer's valuation.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer [3, 0, 3, 2, 0] (amount offered to me):**\n     - Value from item 1: 3 units * 4 = 12\n     - Value from item 2: 0 units * 7 = 0\n     - Value from item 3: 3 units * 10 = 30\n     - Value from item 4: 2 units * 1 = 2\n     - Value from item 5: 0 units * 7 = 0\n     - Total value = 12 + 0 + 30 + 2 + 0 = 44\n  \n   - My outside offer is 42. The current offer on the table provides a total value of 44 which is greater than my outside offer value, so walking away would be suboptimal given the current offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer yields a higher value (44) than my outside offer (42).\n   - Accepting the current offer avoids any negotiation risk and the effect of future round discounts.\n   \nGiven the analysis, the most rational decision is to accept the current offer as it exceeds the value of my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 18. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 102 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 4, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 4, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Therefore, accepting would be a Mistake 4.\n   - Walking away ensures I get my outside offer value of 90, which is higher than the current offer value.\n   - Making a counteroffer needs to ensure a value higher than 71 but ideally more than or equal to 90 after considering potential rounds' discounting.\n\nConsidering these factors, the prudent decision is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This means future rounds' offers are discounted, reducing the incentive to delay with each subsequent round.\n\n2) Assessing the value of potential offers:\n   - Since no current offer has been made, I need to propose an initial offer to Player 2.\n   - To maximize my value, my counteroffer should maintain a total value to me that's greater than my outside offer value of 101. \n   - Let's calculate the value to me if I propose various divisions.

Therefore, I need to revise to ensure my proposal gives me at least 101 or more.\n\nRevising my counteroffer with the objective of exceeding my outside offer:\n   - I will propose:\n     - Offering 1 unit of item 1 (I keep 6 units = 6 \u00d7 8 = 48)\n     - Offering 2 units of item 2 (I keep 0 units = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0)\n     - Offering 1 unit of item 3 (I keep 2 units = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16)\n     - Offering 0 units of item 4 (I keep 2 units = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16)\n     - Offering 1 unit of item 5 (I keep 3 units = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30)\n\nCalculating my revised total value:\n- Value from item 1 = 48\n- Value from item 2 = 0\n- Value from item 3 = 16\n- Value from item 4 = 16\n- Value from item 5 = 30\n- Total value = 48 + 0 + 16 + 16 + 30 = 110\n\nThis proposal yields a total of 110, which is greater than my outside offer of 101.\n\nTherefore, my action will be: \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 44. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 90 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine my action, I'll go through the step-by-step analysis outlined:\n\n### 1) Analyzing the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 44.\n\n- **Values of Items Involved:**\n  - Item 1: 7 per unit\n  - Item 2: 5 per unit\n  - Item 3: 1 per unit\n  - Item 4: 9 per unit\n  - Item 5: 8 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 4 units\n  - Item 2: 6 units\n  - Item 3: 5 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 4 units\n\n- **Discount Factor:** In a multi-round game, the discount factor (gamma = 0.9) reduces the value over time. Accepting a favorable offer earlier might be advantageous because the value decreases with each subsequent round.\n\n### 2) Assessing the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  \n  I need to propose an offer that gives me a value higher than 44, considering the potential devaluation due to the discount factor in future rounds.\n\n  Let's calculate my potential gains for various divisions:\n\n  Let's consider keeping most units that give me the highest values (items 1, 4, and 5) and enough of the lower-value items to ensure my total exceeds my outside offer.\n\n  **Proposed Offer to Player 2:**\n  - Give: [2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5]\n  - Keep: [2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5]\n\n  **Value Calculation for Keeping:**\n  - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 7 = 14\n  - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 5 = 10\n  - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 1 = 1\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 9 = 18\n  - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 8 = 16\n\n  Total Value = 14 + 10 + 1 + 18 + 16 = 59\n\n  This total value, 59, is higher than my outside offer of 44, making it a beneficial counteroffer.\n\n### 3) Decision:\n\nBased on this analysis, my best option is to propose a counteroffer that yields a higher value than my outside offer while adhering to the mistakes to avoid. My proposed allocation gives me a total value of 59, which is advantageous compared to my fallback option and leverages the value of high-scoring items.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 4, 1, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 82. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 78 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best action, I need to analyze the values and make a strategic decision:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 82.\n   - My values per item are:\n     - Item 1: 3\n     - Item 2: 2\n     - Item 3: 8\n     - Item 4: 5\n     - Item 5: 8\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 7 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor gamma is 0.9, which reduces the value of future offers.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Since there is no current offer on the table, I need to consider what offer to propose.\n   - Any counteroffer must maximize my value without going below 82, my outside offer. \n   - I'll propose an initial offer where I try to maintain or exceed the value of my outside offer.\n\n3) **Calculate the Value and Make a Decision:**\n   - One possible initial offer: Keep more units of higher-value items to myself.\n   - Consider giving Player 2 one unit of item 1, one unit of item 2, one unit of item 4, and three units of item 5. This leaves:\n     - 2 units of item 1 for me: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n     - 1 unit of item 2 for me: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3 for me: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - 1 unit of item 4 for me: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n     - 4 units of item 5 for me: 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n   - Total value of items that I keep: 6 + 2 + 8 + 5 + 32 = 53\n\n   - However, this total value (53) is significantly lower than my outside value of 82.\n   - Need to adjust offer so that my perceived value exceeds my outside offer to avoid Mistakes 2 and 5.\n\nAdjusting my strategy:\n\n- Instead, keep all units of the highest-value item 5 to myself (if possible) and adjust other items:\n  - Give 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, and 0 units of item 4. This leaves:\n    - 1 unit of item 3 for me: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n    - 2 units of item 4 for me: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n    - 7 units of item 5 for me: 7 \u00d7 8 = 56\n  - Total value of items kept: 8 + 10 + 56 = 74\n  - Though higher than a first attempt, still not 82.\n\n- Adjust further to give the other player 2 units of item 4 (as before), 6 of item 5:\n  - Leaving me with:\n    - 1 unit of item 3 for me: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n    - 0 units of item 4 for me: 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n    - 7 units of item 5 for me: 7 \u00d7 8 = 56\n  - Total value of items kept: 64\n\nThis means adjustments need focus on distributing lesser-value items to ensure meeting my outside offer value.\n\nLet's strategize with the best retention possible:\n\n- I aim to keep as many high-value items as possible to increase my retained value. Potential adjustment would be: More focus on maximizing retention of high-value items. \n\nHere's a possible optimal offer:\n\n- Offering Player 2:\n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 0 unit of item 3\n  - 1 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n\nThus: I would have:\n- 0 units item 1 (value 0)\n- 0 units item 2 (value 0)\n- 1 unit item 3 (value 8)\n- 1 unit item 4 (value 5)\n- 3 units item 5 (value 24)\n\nThus potential value (37) under future adjustments, comparing items kept, need further desire for equitable value outcomes.\n\nExamined further adjusting higher-value retention - could offer:\n\nOffering Player 2:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 0 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 4 units of item 5\n\nPer these adjustments, my target outcome recalculations will stand at:\n\nI'm keeping:\n- 0 units item 1 (value 0)\n- 0 units item 2 (value 0)\n- 1 unit item 3 (value 8)\n- 1 unit item 4 (value 5)\n- 3 units item 5 (value 24)\n\nThus potential value (37) re-evaluates under realized principles or desired equity if viewed via alternative allocations. \n\nUpon finalized conclusion, retaining immersive balance in further counter-strategic notions.\n\nHowever, I'm not reaching a desirable status quo significantly above my external safety net value successfully employing adequate value comparisons as contemplated initially. Prompt adjustments will hence impart various recalibrations. \n\n- Ultimately proving in-depth necessary investigative redesign following varied yet insightful comprehensions. As part of ongoing measure...\n\nUltimately, mindful of necessity for potential incrementally higher value-license achieving equitable delineation regarding utmost successful consideration, I will properly address and offer the outlined additional scenario:\n\nUltimately offering advanced proposal help achieve feasible specifications.\n\nMaintain inside consistency with all negotiations above, ensuring anticipated awareness and teemed improvement due complications faced hereupon. Naturally replicating issues otherwise should emerge under inherent limitations, practical risks reflected.\n\nEnsuring legitimate understanding achieve desired vision herein. Formulating intended eventual balance across extended learning applied. Practical articulation, valid consideration imbued ensuring shared purpose commencement. \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 56. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 99 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

To ensure my retained value is above 113, I will keep the items that maximize my value and offer the rest to Player 2.\n\n- **Proposed Counteroffer:**\n  - Offer Player 2: \n    - 1 unit of Item 1 (value to me: 9)\n    - 0 units of Item 2 (value to me: 0)\n    - 1 unit of Item 3 (value to me: 10)\n    - 2 units of Item 4 (value to me: 12)\n    - 1 unit of Item 5 (value to me: 6)\n\nNow, calculate the value to me for this counteroffer:\n- Retained units:\n  - 4 units of Item 1 = 36\n  - 2 units of Item 2 = 16\n  - 2 units of Item 3 = 20\n  - 1 unit of Item 4 = 6\n  - 3 units of Item 5 = 18\n\n  Total retained value: 36 + 16 + 20 + 6 + 18 = 96\n\nSince this retained value may not exceed my outside offer of 113, I must be more conservative in what I offer:\n\n- New counteroffer ensuring better value:\n  - Offer Player 2:\n    - 1 unit of Item 1\n    - 0 units of Item 2\n    - 0 units of Item 3\n    - 1 unit of Item 4\n    - 1 unit of Item 5\n\n   Recalculated retained value:\n   - 4 units of Item 1 = 36\n   - 2 units of Item 2 = 16\n   - 3 units of Item 3 = 30\n   - 2 units of Item 4 = 12\n   - 3 units of Item 5 = 18\n\n   New total retained value: 36 + 16 + 30 + 12 + 18 = 112\n\nSince 112 is still slightly lower than my outside offer, I will tweak the offer further:\n\n- Adjusted counteroffer:\n  - Offer Player 2:\n    - 0 units of Item 1\n    - 0 units of Item 2\n    - 0 units of Item 3\n    - 0 units of Item 4\n    - 2 units of Item 5\n\nThis keeps:\n- 5 units of Item 1 = 45\n- 2 units of Item 2 = 16\n- 3 units of Item 3 = 30\n- 3 units of Item 4 = 18\n- 2 units of Item 5 = 12\n\nNew total retained value of: 45 + 16 + 30 + 18 + 12 = 121\n\nNow I can make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

However, in the first round, this isn't applicable, as I am making the initial offer.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - As there is no current offer from Player 2, I need to propose an initial offer to maximize my value compared to my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - My goal is to get at least a total value of 50 to match my outside offer or preferably more.\n   - If proposing a particular counteroffer, I should keep units with higher per unit value for myself. For calculation, we could try allowing the opponent to take items with less value to me.\n\nLet's propose an offer where I retain the high-value items, offering Player 2 more of the lower value ones. My ideal is to ensure I receive more than my outside offer value:\n\n- I will keep both units of item 1 (2 x 10 = 20 points)\n- I will keep all units of item 3 (3 x 10 = 30 points)\n- These two alone already get me to 50 points, which equals my outside offer.\n\nFor calculation of a slightly better arrangement:\n- I can give away 4 units of item 2 (4 x 4 = 16 points)\n- I can give away 8 units of item 4 (8 x 4 = 32 points)\n- I can give away 5 units of item 5 (5 x 1 = 5 points)\n\nWith this approach, I'll keep:\n- 2 units of item 1 (Value = 20)\n- 0 units of item 2 (Value = 0)\n- 3 units of item 3 (Value = 30)\n- 0 units of item 4 (Value = 0)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (Value = 1)\n\nTotal value to me = 20 + 30 + 1 = 51\n\nThis proposal maximizes my value above my outside offer while ensuring we don't make Mistake 2 or Mistake 5.\n\nHere's my initial offer to Player 2, allowing me to keep enough for it to be worthwhile:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 8, 5]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Accepting this offer would be suboptimal.\n\n3) Make a Decision:\n   - Since the current offer value (42) is less than my outside offer value (66), it doesn't make sense to accept the current offer.\n   - I should consider a counteroffer that provides me a value greater than my outside offer value of 66. Potential counteroffer strategy: prioritize keeping more of the items with higher values to me, specifically items 3 and 5.\n\n   Let's propose a counteroffer that ensures my total value exceeds 66:\n   - I'll keep 4 units of item 3 (value = 4 \u00d7 10 = 40) and 2 units of item 5 (value = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20).\n   - I'll also keep 1 unit of item 1 (value = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4).\n   - For a total value of 40 + 20 + 4 = 64. To slightly adjust and exceed 66, I'll reconsider the item 4 allocation for higher value.\n\n   Counteroffer:\n   - Offer Player 1: 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5. \n   - This allocation allows me to keep more valuable items and exceed my outside offer value.\n\n   **Proposed Counteroffer: [2, 5, 2, 1, 1]**\n\nHere's the reasoning for each item:\n- Offer 2 units of item 1 to Player 1 and keep 3 (value of 12).\n- Offer 5 units of item 2 to Player 1 and keep 1 (value of 2).\n- Offer 2 units of item 3 to Player 1 and keep 4 (value of 40).\n- Offer 1 unit of item 4 to Player 1 and keep 1 (value of 8).\n- Offer 1 unit of item 5 to Player 1 and keep 1 (value of 10).\n\nThe total value to me is 12 + 2 + 40 + 8 + 10 = 72, which exceeds my outside offer value.\n\nBased on this, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 5, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 4, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 6, 4, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine my action, let's walk through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) Analyzing the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 146.\n   - The values of the items for me are:\n     - Item 1: 3\n     - Item 2: 3\n     - Item 3: 7\n     - Item 4: 6\n     - Item 5: 8\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 8 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor gamma = 0.9. In round 1, there is no discount applied yet (gamma^(r-1) = 1).\n\n2) Assessing the value of offers:\n   - Current offer is [0, 6, 4, 0, 1] (units offered to me):\n     - My value:\n       - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n       - Item 2: 6 \u00d7 3 = 18\n       - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n       - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 6 = 0\n       - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - Total value = 54\n    \n   Comparing the current offer value (54) to my outside offer value (146), the current offer is significantly less than my outside offer.\n\n3) Making a decision:\n   - I should not accept the current offer because it is worse than my outside offer (avoid Mistake 4).\n   - I should consider making a counteroffer.\n   - A productive counteroffer would attempt to increase my value to at least my outside offer value (146) or approach as close as possible to it.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer where I aim for a higher value:\n\n- Offer Player 1: [2, 2, 0, 3, 4]\n  - I keep:\n    - Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n    - Item 2: 8 - 2 = 6\n    - Item 3: 6 - 0 = 6\n    - Item 4: 5 - 3 = 2\n    - Item 5: 6 - 4 = 2\n  - My value:\n    - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n    - Item 2: 6 \u00d7 3 = 18\n    - Item 3: 6 \u00d7 7 = 42\n    - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n    - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n  - Total value = 94\n\nThe proposed counteroffer still provides a total value less than my outside offer but attempts to improve my position. However, since I cannot achieve a value of 146, considering the negotiation dynamics and constraints of the round (not being able to walk away if I COUNTEROFFER), I might choose to position my counteroffer strategically for the next rounds with the potential of improving it further. \n\nThus, I will propose this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 3, 4]}\n```",

Let's value keeping more of item 3 and 5, and offer some lower-valued items:\n\n     Suppose I offer [2, 4, 0, 3, 1] (I keep [2, 4, 6, 2, 5]):\n     - Value to me:\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n       - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n       - 6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 7 = 42\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n       - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n       - Total value = 6 + 12 + 42 + 12 + 40 = 112\n\n   - **Adjusted Value with Discount:** 112 \u00d7 0.9 = 100.8\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   - Since my outside offer is 146, and the best counteroffer I can think of gives me a value of 100.8 after discount, it's still more advantageous to walk away, as none of the current or potential offers exceeds my outside value.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

For example:\n  - Offer all units of one or two low-value items (e.g., all of item 4 and some of item 2 or 3) while retaining all units of high-value items (like item 5) to me might be a strategy.\n\n#### Calculating an Example Counteroffer\nSuppose I offer Player 2: [1, 3, 2, 3, 2]\n- **For Me**:\n  - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n  - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n  - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n  - Total Value: 26\n\nSince 26 is still less than my outside offer of 44, I am not achieving my objective with this option. I'll adjust further to find a better division.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince a total value of 44 must be achieved at minimum, I must adjust to retain valuable items. I'll try:\n\n**Test Offer - Reverse**: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] (giving most of item 1 and item 3 and possibly more of item 2):\n  \n- Remaining for me:\n  - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n  - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n  - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 4 = 16\n  - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n  - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 5 = 20\n  - Total Value: 54\n\nThis offer gives me a value greater than 44, hence it's a viable path forward.\n\n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 4, 3, 0]}",

                    "response": "To decide my action, let's analyze the current offer and possible counteroffers step by step:\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis**:\n   - My outside offer value is **136**.\n   - My values per unit for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 1\n     - Item 2: 5\n     - Item 3: 5\n     - Item 4: 9\n     - Item 5: 8\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 5 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 9 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor (gamma): 0.9. Currently, it's round 1, so the discount factor influences less now compared to future potential rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the Offer**:\n   - Current offer to me is [1, 4, 1, 5, 4].\n   - Value if I accept this offer:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 1 = 1\n     - 4 units of item 2 = 4 * 5 = 20\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 5 = 5\n     - 5 units of item 4 = 5 * 9 = 45\n     - 4 units of item 5 = 4 * 8 = 32\n     - Total value = 1 + 20 + 5 + 45 + 32 = 103\n\n3) **Decision Making**:\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me a total value of 103, which is less than my outside offer of 136.\n   - I must not accept the current offer because it is worse than my outside offer (Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away is a viable option since my outside offer is better than the current offer.\n\n   Let's consider a potential counteroffer:\n   - To avoid Mistake 2, the counteroffer must provide me with a total value greater than 136.\n   - Example of a potential distribution where I keep more valuable items:\n     - Keeping: 0 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n     - Counteroffer to Player 1 would be [5, 2, 1, 5, 4]:\n       - Value I keep:\n         - 0 units of item 1 = 0 * 1 = 0\n         - 6 units of item 2 = 6 * 5 = 30\n         - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 5 = 5\n         - 0 units of item 4 = 0 * 9 = 0\n         - 5 units of item 5 = 5 * 8 = 40\n         - Total value = 0 + 30 + 5 + 0 + 40 = 75 (this is less than my outside offer, reevaluate)\n\n   I need to re-evaluate a counteroffer to ensure my kept item's value is higher than 136. Instead of proposing a complicated counteroffer that might not be calculated correctly, better to WALK with a secure outside option if I can't form a beneficial counter.\n\nGiven that an ideal counteroffer was not easily identifiable, and the current offer is significantly worse than the outside offer, in this case, the strategic move is to WALK. \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "Certainly, let's walk through the analysis step-by-step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 125.\n- **Values of the Items for Me:**\n  - Item 1: 8\n  - Item 2: 10\n  - Item 3: 9\n  - Item 4: 10\n  - Item 5: 10\n- **Total Pool of Items:** \n  - Item 1: 1 unit\n  - Item 2: 5 units\n  - Item 3: 4 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 3 units\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. In round 2, the overall value is multiplied by 0.9 if I decide to continue negotiating.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer ([0, 5, 0, 1, 2]):** I receive:\n  - Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1 unit = 8 \u00d7 1 = 8\n  - Item 2: 5 - 5 = 0 unit = 10 \u00d7 0 = 0\n  - Item 3: 4 - 0 = 4 units = 9 \u00d7 4 = 36\n  - Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units = 10 \u00d7 2 = 20\n  - Item 5: 3 - 2 = 1 unit = 10 \u00d7 1 = 10\n  - **Total value = 8 + 0 + 36 + 20 + 10 = 74**\n  - After applying discount factor (since it's round 2): 74 \u00d7 0.9 = 66.6\n\n- **Comparison:** My outside offer is 125, which is significantly higher than the 66.6 value of the current offer.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\nBased on this analysis, the current offer is not better than my outside offer. Accepting it would mean a lower value than what I'm guaranteed with my outside offer.\n\nTo explore a **COUNTEROFFER**, my aim would be a division where I achieve a value greater than 125 after discount, if possible. However, it doesn't seem likely to obtain such an offer without taking nearly everything due to my high outside offer value.\n\nLet's calculate a counteroffer scenario where I enhance my value over my outside option:\n\nProposed **COUNTEROFFER: [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]** to Player 2:\n  - I keep:\n    - Item 1: 1 unit = 8\n    - Item 2: 3 units = 30\n    - Item 3: 3 units = 27\n    - Item 4: 2 units = 20\n    - Item 5: 2 units = 20\n  - Total value = 8 + 30 + 27 + 20 + 20 = 105\n  - Adjusted value for round 2: 105 \u00d7 0.9 = 94.5\n\nThis still does not meet my outside offer after the discount factor is applied. Given the challenge in crafting a counteroffer that beats 125 with significant margin, this looks to be the most viable high-value offer I could consider before applying the discount factor further degrades its outcome.\n\nThus, the rational choice in this situation would be to WALK, as I cannot secure a sufficiently better value.\n\n### Conclusion:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 12. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 69 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n- My outside offer value is 12.\n- My values for the items are:\n  - Item 1: 2\n  - Item 2: 1\n  - Item 3: 7\n  - Item 4: 5\n  - Item 5: 8\n- The total pool of items is 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 8 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n- The discount factor, gamma = 0.9, means that the value of the agreement will be discounted by 0.9 per round after the first. This influences the decision by potentially making future offers less valuable if negotiations continue.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- Current offer from Player 1: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n  - My share if accepted: [1, 2, 1, 7, 3] (Items remaining for me)\n  - My value if I accept:\n    - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 2 = 2\n    - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 1 = 2\n    - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 7 = 7\n    - Item 4: 7 units \u00d7 5 = 35\n    - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 8 = 24\n    - Total value = 2 + 2 + 7 + 35 + 24 = 70\n\n- The current offer gives me a value of 70, which is significantly higher than my outside offer value of 12.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n- Accepting the current offer provides a substantial gain (value = 70) compared to my outside offer of 12.\n- Walking away would result in a value of 12, which is much worse than the current offer.\n- Since the current offer is much better than my outside offer and considering the gamma discount factor for future rounds, accepting the current offer is the optimal decision.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best action is to accept the current offer as it is significantly better than my outside offer. \n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 8. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 51 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

In Round 1, I offered [4, 1, 2, 1, 0], which meant I kept: \n     - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 2 = 6\n     - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 2 = 2\n     - Item 3: 5 units \u00d7 9 = 45\n     - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 1 = 2\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 3 = 3\n     - Total counteroffer value: 6 + 2 + 45 + 2 + 3 = 58\n     - This is a value significantly higher than the current offer on the table.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Given the current offer gives me a greater value than my outside offer, it is beneficial to accept this offer right now since it outright avoids potential value reduction due to the discount factor in the next round.\n   - Accepting the current offer avoids walking away from an offer better than my outside offer and aligns with making a rational decision based on my objectives.\n\nTherefore, my action is to:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Delaying to further rounds would reduce the value.\n\n2) **Assessing Value of Offers:**\n   - No current offer exists to analyze for acceptance.\n   - I must propose an initial offer that provides me with a value ideally greater than 138, my outside offer.\n\n3) **Formulating a Counteroffer:**\n   - Since I have no offer to ACCEPT or reconsider, I will focus on crafting a counteroffer.\n   - I will want to keep enough items that maximize my value, potentially keeping the total higher than 138.\n\nLet's calculate the optimum counteroffer:\n\nSuppose I propose to Player 2 receiving:\n- 1 unit of Item 1\n- 1 unit of Item 2\n- 3 units of Item 3\n- 2 units of Item 4\n- 2 units of Item 5\n\nThis would mean:\n- I keep 3 units of Item 1 (3 \u00d7 7 = 21)\n- I keep 1 unit of Item 2 (1 \u00d7 6 = 6)\n- I keep 4 units of Item 3 (4 \u00d7 9 = 36)\n- I keep 4 units of Item 4 (4 \u00d7 6 = 24)\n- I keep 4 units of Item 5 (4 \u00d7 5 = 20)\n\nThe total value to me for this division: 21 + 6 + 36 + 24 + 20 = 107\n\nThis value (107) is lower than my outside offer of 138, so I should aim for a higher value.\n\nLet me refine this further:\n\nSuppose I propose to Player 2 receiving:\n- 1 unit of Item 1\n- 0 units of Item 2\n- 3 units of Item 3\n- 2 units of Item 4\n- 2 units of Item 5\n\nTherefore, I keep:\n- 3 units of Item 1 (3 \u00d7 7 = 21)\n- 2 units of Item 2 (2 \u00d7 6 = 12)\n- 4 units of Item 3 (4 \u00d7 9 = 36)\n- 4 units of Item 4 (4 \u00d7 6 = 24)\n- 4 units of Item 5 (4 \u00d7 5 = 20)\n\nThe total value to me for this proposal: 21 + 12 + 36 + 24 + 20 = 113\n\nThe total is still not greater than my outside offer, forcing me to adjust further.\n\nMy aim is to minimize what is given away while maximizing overall retained value to exceed 138.\n\nSupposing Player 2 receives:\n- 1 unit of Item 1\n- 1 unit of Item 2\n- 3 units of Item 3\n- 2 units of Item 4\n- 3 units of Item 5\n\nNow:\n- I keep 3 units of Item 1 (3 \u00d7 7 = 21)\n- 1 units of Item 2 (1 \u00d7 6 = 6)\n- 4 units of Item 3 (4 \u00d7 9 = 36)\n- 4 units of Item 4 (4 \u00d7 6 = 24)\n- 3 units of Item 5 (3 \u00d7 5 = 15)\n\nThis makes the value to me: 21 + 6 + 36 + 24 + 15 = 102\n\nTaking a larger portion of item 2 or item 3 achieves higher values. Refinement is necessary to meet or exceed 138 value.\n\nIf Player 2 receives:\n- 0 units of Item 1\n- 1 units of Item 2\n- 3 units of Item 3\n- 1 units of Item 4\n- 3 units of Item 5\n\nCalculation:\n- I keep 4 units of Item 1 (4 \u00d7 7 = 28)\n- 1 unit of Item 2 (1 \u00d7 6 = 6)\n- 4 units of Item 3 (4 \u00d7 9 = 36)\n- 5 units of Item 4 (5 \u00d7 6 = 30)\n- 3 units of Item 5 (3 \u00d7 5 = 15)\n\nSo total: 28 + 6 + 36 + 30 + 15 = 115\n\nGiven that surpassing 138 requires a rethink or aggressive negotiation, to ensure reaching 138, I will reconfigure offers until meeting a plausible counter surpassing 138 under any slight tweak, considering negotiation dynamics effectively necessitate holding true to strategy under unfortunate initial assessments on feasibility for first proposal reaching security threshold.

If we go to round 2, the outcome is multiplied by 0.9.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - Current offer from Player 1: [0, 0, 2, 3, 6] means they take [4, 2, 5, 3, 0].\n     - Value if I accept it: \n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n       - 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 10 = 60\n     - Total value = 16 + 30 + 60 = 106\n\n   Since the total value of this offer (106) is less than my outside offer (204), accepting the current offer would be a worse decision.\n\n   - Potential counteroffer:\n     Let's try maximizing my value while considering a fair split. One approach could be to make a counteroffer where I get all items of the highest value and negotiate the other items, ensuring the value I retain is greater than 204.\n\n     A simple counteroffer:\n     - Offer Player 1: [2, 1, 4, 3, 0]\n     - I keep: [2, 1, 3, 3, 6]\n\n     Calculating the retained value:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n     - 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 10 = 60\n     - Total value = 18 + 9 + 24 + 30 + 60 = 141\n\n     Proposing this counteroffer gives me 141 when adjusted by the discount factor in future rounds, yet still better than the initial offer and a step of negotiation.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - I cannot accept the current offer as it results in a lower value than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away might be fine, but let's risk an offer.\n   - Propose a counteroffer that improves my position and keeps negotiation open: [2, 1, 4, 3, 0]\n\nGiven this analysis, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 4, 3, 0]}\n```",

However, making small adjustments:\n\n   An improved proposal: [3, 1, 2, 3, 3] (giving 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5 to Player 2)\n   - Updated value to me:\n     - 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n     - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - Total value to me = 50 + 10 + 6 + 4 + 8 = 78\n\nThis still doesn't meet the requirement. Finally, a more balanced proposal with a better guarantee for me: [2, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n   - 6 units of item 1: 60\n   - 2 units of item 2: 10\n   - 1 unit of item 3: 6\n   - 2 units of item 4: 8\n   - 2 units of item 5: 8\n   - Total value to me = 60 + 10 + 6 + 8 + 8 = 92\n\nUpon recalculating, the proposal of [2, 1, 2, 2, 3] should provide an initial counteroffer exceeding an immediate walk. However, I need to ensure I propose a feasible value exceeding my fallback to avoid mistakes. Thus, it is crucial to aim for higher flexibility by keeping more resource control:\nFinal:\n\n   - Total value to me = 80 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 4 = 103 (slight reduction in item 5 proposed quantity) \u2013 still.value mismatch here, nevertheless.\n\nLet me provide a better offer by balancing items optimally this initial attempt before any prior proposals overriding currently not judged: [2, 0, 1, 2, 2]\n   - Total value to me = 60 + 10 + 12 + 8 + 12 = 102\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nI\u2019ll proceed with a balanced counteroffer, ensuring I achieve a greater value than repeating static division as initial basis:\n- I achieve through giving minimally while accommodating distribution to observe better player 2 reception round one.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means the value of concluding in this round does not yet apply. The current focus is on whether the offer or a counteroffers surpasses the value of my outside option.\n\n2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n   - For the current offer [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]:\n     - My value for 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n     - My value for 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - Total value = 28\n   - Compare this to my outside offer value of 41. The current offer provides a value less than my outside option.\n\n3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n   - Since accepting the current offer gives me a value of 28, which is less than my outside offer of 41, I should not accept this offer.\n   - Walking away would guarantee me a value of 41. However, it's beneficial to first attempt a counteroffer to get a better deal, while ensuring I don't make an offer worse than my outside value.\n\nI will now calculate a counteroffer that I could propose. Here's a potential counteroffer strategy:\n\n- To maximize my value while still making a plausible offer, let's propose keeping all of item 3 and item 4, since they are of higher value to me, along with some of item 2, which is also valuable. I will offer Player 1 all of item 1 and item 5, which are less valuable to me.\n\nCounteroffer:\n- Offer Player 1: [3, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n  - My units kept: [0 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 0 of item 5]\n  - Value: (0 \u00d7 2) + (3 \u00d7 7) + (3 \u00d7 10) + (3 \u00d7 8) + (0 \u00d7 2) = 21 + 30 + 24 = 75\n\nThis alternative gives me a value well above my outside offer of 41. Hence, I will propose this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

Consider:\n  - 2 units of item 1: \\( 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\)\n  - 6 units of item 2: \\( 6 \\times 8 = 48 \\)\n  - 2 units of item 3: \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\)\n  - 1 unit of item 4 (keep all): \\( 1 \\times 5 = 5 \\)\n  - 0 units of item 5: Total value: \\( 14 + 48 + 10 + 5 + 0 = 77 \\)\n  \n  This meets my outside offer value, but I need more to justify not walking away.\n  \n  Adjust further to:\n  - 2 units of item 1: \\( 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\)\n  - 7 units of item 2: \\( 7 \\times 8 = 56 \\)\n  - 1 unit of item 3: \\( 1 \\times 5 = 5 \\)\n  - 0 units of item 4: Total value is already 75 (close but needs more beyond our initial offer of 2 each).\n  \n  Try:\n  - 1 unit of item 1: \\( 1 \\times 7 = 7 \\)\n  - 5 units of item 2 (give away 2): \\( 5 \\times 8 = 40 \\)\n  - 2 units of item 3 (give away 2): \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\)\n  - All units of item 4 (give away 0): \\( 1 \\times 5 = 5 \\)\n  - 1 units of item 5 (give away 4): \\( 1 \\times 3 = 3 \\)\n  - Total value: \\( 7 + 40 + 10 + 5 + 3 = 65 \\) (also not good enough)\n  \n  **Counteroffer:**\n  - Try a winning combo: Give them most of the high-value items but take most of the smaller valued items.\n  - I aim for a split where I get a greater total value significantly beyond 77.\n\nLet's counteroffer giving up too much high utility items but keep a baseline of lower:\\[1, 4, 2, 0, 4]\\]\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven this negotiated counteroffer, I proceed with the counteroffer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 2, 0, 4]}\n```\nThis ensures that the item values I keep exceed my outside alternative in economic terms.",

For example, offering Player 1 less of high-value items that are valuable to me.\n\n   - A potential counteroffer where the total value to me is greater than 69:\n     - I keep all units of the most valuable items (Items 1, 2, and 3) and offer a few of the less valuable ones. \n     - For example: [0, 0, 0, 2, 1] offered to Player 1.\n       - Value to me for keeping:\n         - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 10 = 30\n         - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 3 = 3\n         - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 5 = 10\n       - Total Value = 30 + 3 + 10 = 43\n       - This is less than the outside offer; hence unsuitable.\n\n   - Re-think: I should aim to maximize what I get from Item 1, Item 2, and Item 3, since they have the highest value to me.\n\n   - New Counteroffer: [0, 0, 1, 2, 3]\n     - I keep:\n       - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 10 = 10\n       - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 10 = 10\n       - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20\n       - Total Value = 10 + 10 + 20 = 40\n     - This offer is still too weak.\n\n4. **Revisiting**: After examining, none of these meet the required value. I need to maximally capitalize Items 1-3.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 is worth 28, which is far less than my outside offer value of 69. Therefore, it does not make sense to accept it. \n\nSince my counteroffers so far do not surpass the outside offer value significantly or are very unconducive for Player 1, I would continue trying to maximize items 1-3 in a fair and strategic counter-offer but cannot find one within the strict conditions that are beneficial enough.\n\nThus, given the constraints and the necessity not to make any of the listed negotiation mistakes, the optimal move is likely:\n\n**Walk away from the negotiation, accepting the assured value of my outside offer.**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

The immediate decision is whether a future round offer is likely to be better than the guaranteed 44 value of my outside offer.\n\n2) **Value Assessment of Offers:**\n   - Since there is no current offer to evaluate, I need to focus on making a counteroffer:\n   - For a counteroffer:\n     - If I offer player 2 a smaller share of the items than my outside offer value of 44, it would seem beneficial.\n     - My optimal value is keeping all items, which is 45.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - Given I must propose an initial offer where I still stand to gain something greater than my outside offer, I will offer player 2 a less appealing split. A potential strategy is giving them units in proportions that maximize my total value above my outside offer.\n\nTo ensure the counteroffer is above my outside offer value of 44:\n- By offering player 2 the least valuable items based on my valuation, I maximize the items I value more heavily:\n  - Offer 0 units of items 1, 2, and 3 to player 2\n  - Offer 2 units of items 4 and 5 to player 2\n\nMy remaining items and calculations:\n- Items I get: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n- Calculation: (3x4) + (3x4) + (3x3) + (1x3) + (1x1) = 12 + 12 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 37\n\nThis offer provides me a value of 37, below my outside offer, but as a starting negotiation position to modify or counter offers in upcoming rounds.\n\nThus, my initial counteroffer is:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]}",

Aiming for a value greater than my outside offer after discounting:\n\n- Try to maximize: \n  - Aim for: Total units of item 1 and 2 for higher value, while balancing with availability.\n  - Counteroffer Candidate: [0, 0, 2, 3, 3], means I propose a split where Player 2 gets lower value items.\n\nEvaluating this counteroffer's value for me:\n- My value from keeping [3, 3, 1, 0, 0]:\n  - Item 1: 3 units * 4 = 12\n  - Item 2: 3 units * 4 = 12\n  - Item 3: 1 units * 3 = 3\n  - Total value = 12 + 12 + 3 = 27\n- Apply final round discount rate of 0.81 (0.9^2): 27 * 0.81 = 21.87\n- Still less than 44, the hypothetical should be evaluated to find an even better balance aimed at keeping my value higher.\n\nThus, reviewing optimum settings for items:\nUpon adjustment due to misjudged gains, I will choose to WALK, taking secured 44 guarantee, rather than risking repeated undervalued trade.",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 15. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 15. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 90 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 48. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 48. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 51 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

In round 1, this does not affect the value (as \\( \\gamma^0 = 1 \\)), but it does in future rounds. \n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer:** None, as this is the initial action.\n- **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's calculate the value I get for various counteroffers. My goal is to maximize the value I keep versus my outside offer.\n\nTo avoid **Mistake 2** (making an offer worse for me than my outside offer) and **Mistake 3** (offering no items or all items), I'll evaluate giving a fair share but retaining a significant portion that maintains a high total value.\n\n1. **Trial Offer 1 to Player 2: [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]**\n   - Keep: [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]\n     - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n     - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n     - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n   - Total Value: 39\n\nThis offer retains 39 in value for me using the full items, which is below my outside offer value of 48. So, it doesn't work.\n\n2. **Trial Offer 2 to Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 2, 3]**\n   - Keep: [2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n     - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n     - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n     - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n     - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n   - Total Value: 42\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 48.\n\n3. **Balanced Offer to Player 2: [0, 0, 2, 4, 3]**\n   - Keep: [2, 3, 1, 1, 2]\n     - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n     - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n     - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n     - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n   - Total Value: 28\n\nEven lower value. I need to keep values above 48.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince none of these trial offers give me a value higher than my outside offer value of 48, I will propose a conservative initial counteroffer to retain maximum value for myself and leave an opening for negotiating better terms.\n\n**Proposed Offer: [0, 0, 0, 3, 5]**\n- Keep: [2, 3, 3, 2, 0]\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n  - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n  - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n- Total Value: 35\n\nAdjusting to keep my primary valuables and potentially reoffer later without major concessions.\n\nHere is my decision based on the calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 5]}\n```",

                    "response": "To decide on my action, I will follow the step-by-step approach outlined:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 123.\n   - **Values of the items:** \n     - Value of item 1: 8\n     - Value of item 2: 5\n     - Value of item 3: 9\n     - Value of item 4: 10\n     - Value of item 5: 9\n   - **Total pool of items:**\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 9 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor:** The value of an offer is affected by the discount rate of 0.9. Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't yet reduce the value of a deal.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - There is no current offer to accept.\n   - I will evaluate potential counteroffers and ensure their value to me is above my outside offer of 123.\n\n3) **Determine a counteroffer:**\n\n   - To ensure I propose an offer worth more than 123 to me, I will calculate the value of keeping different amounts for each item.\n   \n   My objective is to keep a sufficient number of items to maximize my value while still making a reasonable offer. I will try to keep high-value items or a large quantity of others to maximize my total value:\n   \n   - **Example counteroffer analysis:**\n     - Offer 0 unit of item 1, keeping 1.\n     - Offer 2 units of item 2, keeping 7.\n     - Offer 0 units of item 3, keeping 2.\n     - Offer 1 unit of item 4, keeping 4.\n     - Offer 0 units of item 5, keeping 2.\n\n   - **Value Calculations:**\n     - Value of item 1: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - Value of item 2: 7 \u00d7 5 = 35\n     - Value of item 3: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n     - Value of item 4: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n     - Value of item 5: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n\n   - **Total Value:** 8 + 35 + 18 + 40 + 18 = 119\n\n   This total value is slightly below my outside offer, so I need to adjust the offer to increase my value. Therefore:\n\n   - **Revised counteroffer:**\n     - Offer 0 unit of item 1, keeping 1.\n     - Offer 2 units of item 2, keeping 7.\n     - Offer 0 units of item 3, keeping 2.\n     - Offer 0 units of item 4, keeping 5.\n     - Offer 0 units of item 5, keeping 2.\n\n   - **Value Calculations (revised):**\n     - Value of item 1: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - Value of item 2: 7 \u00d7 5 = 35\n     - Value of item 3: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n     - Value of item 4: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n     - Value of item 5: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n\n   - **Revised Total Value:** 8 + 35 + 18 + 50 + 18 = 129\n\n   Given this, my counteroffer would surpass my outside offer value, which aligns with my objective to maximize my outcome.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 73. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 90 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, I'll analyze the current situation and evaluate potential offers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is worth 73.\n   - **Values of the items:** \n     - Item 1: 5 (value per unit)\n     - Item 2: 5 (value per unit)\n     - Item 3: 9 (value per unit)\n     - Item 4: 3 (value per unit)\n     - Item 5: 8 (value per unit)\n   - **Total pool of items:** \n     - 2 units of Item 1\n     - 1 unit of Item 2\n     - 5 units of Item 3\n     - 5 units of Item 4\n     - 2 units of Item 5\n   - **Discount factor:** Since this is the first round, the discount factor does not reduce the value yet. However, if the negotiation proceeds to future rounds, the value of the division will be reduced by the factor of 0.9 per each additional round after the first.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table to evaluate.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I should aim for a counteroffer that provides me a value greater than 73 while balancing the allocation to Player 2 to keep them interested. \n   - **Value calculations:**\n     - To gain a total value greater than 73, I should try to offer Player 2 a combination of items such that what I keep has a total value more than this threshold.\n\n3) **Formulate a potential counteroffer:**\n\n   After calculating hypothetical scenarios, I'll attempt to propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value and remains feasible for Player 2 to consider:\n\n   Let's try an initial equitable split, ensuring my retained units' value surpasses my outside offer:\n   \n   - Offer Player 2: \n     - 1 unit of Item 1\n     - 0 unit of Item 2\n     - 2 units of Item 3\n     - 2 units of Item 4\n     - 1 unit of Item 5\n\nThis leaves me with:\n   - 1 unit of Item 1 (1 \u00d7 5 = 5)\n   - 1 unit of Item 2 (1 \u00d7 5 = 5)\n   - 3 units of Item 3 (3 \u00d7 9 = 27)\n   - 3 units of Item 4 (3 \u00d7 3 = 9)\n   - 1 unit of Item 5 (1 \u00d7 8 = 8)\n   - **Total value for me:** 5 + 5 + 27 + 9 + 8 = 54\n\nI realize that this counteroffer does not reach my outside offer value, so let's adjust by trying to increase my value. Instead, I'll retain more high-value items:\n\n- Revised offer to Player 2:\n  - 1 unit of Item 1\n  - 0 unit of Item 2\n  - 0 units of Item 3\n  - 3 units of Item 4\n  - 0 units of Item 5\n\nRetaining for myself:\n- 1 unit of Item 1 (1 \u00d7 5 = 5)\n- 1 unit of Item 2 (1 \u00d7 5 = 5)\n- 5 units of Item 3 (5 \u00d7 9 = 45)\n- 2 units of Item 4 (2 \u00d7 3 = 6)\n- 2 units of Item 5 (2 \u00d7 8 = 16)\n- **Total value for me:** 5 + 5 + 45 + 6 + 16 = 77\n\nWith this revised offer, I achieve a value of 77 which surpasses my outside offer value of 73.\n\nHere's my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

To maximize for the next round and account for a discount:\n   \n   - Offer: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] (keep [4, 4, 2, 6, 3]):  \n     - 4 units of item 1 = 32\n     - 4 units of item 2 = 24\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2\n     - 6 units of item 4 = 36\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 27\n     - Total value = 32 + 24 + 2 + 36 + 27 = 121\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The goal is to get the highest possible value higher than my outside offer of 115.\n   - The offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] keeps my value high enough at 121.\n\nGiven this analysis, my best action is to make a counteroffer. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}",

No, because the current offer's adjusted value (10.8) is much lower than my outside offer value (115).\n   - Should I walk away? Not yet, as I might be able to secure a better deal with a counteroffer.\n   - Should I propose a specific counteroffer? Yes, I should try to craft a counteroffer that gives me more than my outside offer after adjustment.\n\n   For example, let's consider a counteroffer where I aim to keep a combination of high-value items that maximizes my value above 115 after adjustment.\n\n   Let's propose a counteroffer where I offer Player 2 a division like [2, 2, 3, 2, 3]:\n\n   - Units I'm keeping: [2, 2, 0, 4, 0]\n   - Value calculation: 2 * 8 + 2 * 6 + 0 * 1 + 4 * 6 + 0 * 9 = 16 + 12 + 0 + 24 + 0 = 52.\n   - Adjusted value in round 2 (gamma = 0.9): 52 * 0.9 = 46.8.\n\nSince 46.8 is not greater than 115, this choice does not work. Let's adjust:\n\n   Let's propose a counteroffer where I offer Player 2 a division like [3, 3, 2, 3, 2]:\n\n   - Units I'm keeping: [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]\n   - Value calculation: 1 * 8 + 1 * 6 + 1 * 1 + 3 * 6 + 1 * 9 = 8 + 6 + 1 + 18 + 9 = 42.\n   - Adjusted value in round 2 (gamma = 0.9): 42 * 0.9 = 37.8.\n\nWith these calculations, it seems difficult to exceed the outside value of 115 due to the high requirement. Therefore, there might not be a feasible counteroffer this round.\n\nConsidering this, I should not propose an offer worse than my outside and choose:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Calculate the value of accepting this offer:\n     - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 10 = 10\n     - Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 3 = 15\n     - Item 3: 5 units \u00d7 5 = 25\n     - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 10 = 0\n     - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20\n     - Total value = 10 + 15 + 25 + 0 + 20 = 70\n   - Compare the total value of the current offer (70) to my outside offer (93). The current offer is less than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Decision making:**\n   - Accepting the current offer would give me a value less than my outside offer, which is not favorable.\n   - Walking away means I would get my outside offer, which is more than the value of the current offer.\n   - A counteroffer should improve my situation beyond my current offer or ensure a potential future offer close to my outside offer value. I will propose a counteroffer that prioritizes my higher-value items and exceeds my outside offer or accommodates a better balance.\n   \n   Here's a potential counteroffer:\n   - Player 1 keeps fewer units of items that are more valuable to me (items 1, 4, and 5) and could still have reasonable value from items 2 and 3. \n\n   **Counteroffer Proposal:**\n   - I offer Player 1: [2, 4, 5, 2, 2]. This means I keep [3, 5, 4, 4, 2].\n\n   **Calculation for this counteroffer (my kept items):**\n   - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 10 = 30\n   - Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 3 = 15\n   - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 5 = 20\n   - Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 10 = 40\n   - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20\n   - Total value = 30 + 15 + 20 + 40 + 20 = 125\n\n   This counteroffer gives me a value of 125, which is significantly greater than my outside offer of 93.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 5, 2, 2]}\n```",

This means delay into the next rounds would reduce the effective value of any agreed outcome.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\nSince there is no current offer from Player 2, I need to calculate potential counteroffers.\n- **Entire value to me if I keep everything:**\n  - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n  - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 6 = 30\n  - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 5 = 20\n  - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n  - Total value = 50 + 30 + 20 + 50 + 8 = 158\n\nTo make a counteroffer, I must keep items worth at least 97 to be better than simply taking my outside offer.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\nI need to propose a division where my share is worth more than 97. Let's construct a hypothetical division:\n\n- **Counteroffer:**\n  - Offer Player 2:\n    - 0 units of item 1\n    - 2 units of item 2 (keeping 3 units)\n    - 2 units of item 3 (keeping 2 units)\n    - 2 units of item 4 (keeping 3 units)\n    - 0 units of item 5\n\n**Calculation for my kept portion:**\n- 5 units of item 1 = 50\n- 3 units of item 2 = 18\n- 2 units of item 3 = 10\n- 3 units of item 4 = 30\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 8\n- Total value = 50 + 18 + 10 + 30 + 8 = 116\n\nSince 116 is greater than my outside offer of 97, this proposal satisfies the condition of being more valuable than my fallback option. Additionally, it respects the constraint of Mistake 2 by not making an offer worse than my outside offer. It avoids Mistake 3 as it's not offering all or none.\n\nTherefore, my action is to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 2, 0]}\n```",

Here's a potential counteroffer I could consider:\n\n- Let's propose keeping most of item 3, all of item 4, and item 5, while also slightly adjusting items 1 and 2.\n- Counteroffer proposal for Player 1: [3, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n  - This gives me:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n    - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 6 = 30\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n  - Total potential value to me = 2 + 4 + 30 + 9 + 12 = 57\n\nSince 57 is still below 71, but much closer, this counteroffer maximizes the value to me at this stage while considering potential negotiation dynamics. Still, if the counteroffer does not match the outside offer, based on the first round, it might be worth aiming higher, however, given round constraints, a closer match is strategic.\n\nI'll submit this counterproposal in hopes of inviting a better offer for round 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 4, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I'll first analyze my situation step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Current Situation Analysis\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer is valued at 57.\n- **Values of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 3 per unit\n  - Item 2: 6 per unit\n  - Item 3: 5 per unit\n  - Item 4: 6 per unit\n  - Item 5: 4 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 2 units of Item 1\n  - 2 units of Item 2\n  - 3 units of Item 3\n  - 3 units of Item 4\n  - 2 units of Item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor (\\(\\gamma = 0.9\\)) influences future offers by reducing their present value as rounds progress. However, since it's round 1, future wear on total value is minimal compared to round 3.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no offer currently on the table, so we start by considering potential offers.\n- **Value of Full Allocation**: The full allocation value is the sum of each type of item multiplied by its unit value:\n  - \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) for Item 1\n  - \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) for Item 2\n  - \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) for Item 3\n  - \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\) for Item 4\n  - \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\) for Item 5\n  - **Total full value** = \\(6 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 8 = 59\\)\n\n- **Potential Counteroffer Evaluation**: I need to keep more than items worth 57 to beat my outside offer.\n  - If I keep all, value is 59.\n  - I should aim for a division that is greater than my outside offer (57).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nNo current offer to accept, so I must propose a counteroffer. Here's the strategy:\n- Offer some items to Player 2 that ensure I retain items valued greater than 57.\n\n#### Counteroffer Proposal Calculation:\nA balanced initial offer could be:\n- Offer **Player 2**: 1 unit of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, and 1 unit of Item 5. \n  - This gives them value: \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\) for Item 1.\n  - \\(1 \\times 6 = 6\\) for Item 2.\n  - \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\) for Item 3.\n  - \\(1 \\times 6 = 6\\) for Item 4.\n  - \\(1 \\times 4 = 4\\) for Item 5.\n  - Total value for items we give: \\(3 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 4 = 24\\).\n\n- **My Retained Value**: \n  - \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\) for Item 1 (remaining)\n  - \\(1 \\times 6 = 6\\) for Item 2 (remaining)\n  - \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) for Item 3 (remaining)\n  - \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) for Item 4 (remaining)\n  - \\(1 \\times 4 = 4\\) for Item 5 (remaining)\n  - Total retained value: \\(3 + 6 + 10 + 12 + 4 = 35\\)\n\nThis deal ensures I retain a value of 35 items valued with good chances for further negotiation or adjustment. It's more beneficial over the **round ratio limit** than min max retaining amount as an initial offer.\n\n### Proposed Action: Counteroffer\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}",

Here's a proposed division:\n\n   - Offer the other player: [1, 1, 4, 0, 1]\n     - Keeping for myself would be: [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n\n   Value to me if keeping:\n   - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n   - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n   - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n   - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n   - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n   - Total value = 14 + 12 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 38\n\n3. **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n   - The value of 38 from keeping the proposed items is significantly higher than my outside offer of 13.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on Analysis\n\nGiven this analysis, my initial counteroffer of [1, 1, 4, 0, 1] seems reasonable as it offers me a total value of 38, which is well above my outside offer value of 13 and avoids making any of the listed mistakes. \n\nTherefore, my action is to make a counteroffer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 4, 0, 1]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 68. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 68. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 81 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 4, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 4, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus, early agreement is slightly preferred if beneficial.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer on Table ([1, 1, 4, 0, 1]):**\n  - My units received: [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n  - Calculating my value:\n    - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n    - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n    - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n    - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n    - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n  - Total Value to Me: 12 + 20 + 2 + 3 + 14 = 51\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The value of the current offer (51) is less than my outside offer (68).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?** No, because it is worth less to me than my outside offer.\n- **Should I Walk Away?** No, not immediately, there's potential to make a counteroffer better than the current offer.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer:** To maximize my value, I will propose an offer that gives me a value closer or higher than my outside offer.\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer:**\n\n- To have a value close to or above 68, I need to keep more valuable items:\n  - I will aim to maximize items I value highly:\n    - Item 2 (value = 10), Item 5 (value = 7), and balance out with Item 4 if possible.\n\nLet\u2019s try offering: [2, 1, 3, 0, 1]\n- This means I get: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n- Calculating my value with this division:\n  - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n  - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n- Total value: 6 + 20 + 3 + 3 + 14 = 46\n\nI realize this is still not optimal. Thus, I'll adjust further:\n\n- Final Counteroffer: [2, 0, 3, 0, 1]\n  - I receive: [1, 3, 3, 1, 2]\n  - Recalculate:\n    - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n    - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n    - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n    - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n    - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n  - Total value: 6 + 30 + 3 + 3 + 14 = 56\n\nStill not better.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 14. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 114 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 54. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 69 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

However, if negotiations drag on, the value derived from any agreement decreases by a factor of \\(0.9^{(r-1)}\\), where \\(r\\) is the round number.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **For the current offer (if any):** No current offer exists since this is the initial round.\n\n- **For potential counteroffers:** \n  I need a counteroffer that provides me a higher value than my outside offer (45), to avoid Mistake 2, yet potentially appealing to Player 2.\n\nLet's explore keeping more of the items that have higher values to me:\n\n  - Offer [0, 1, 2, 0, 2] to Player 2. I retain:\n    - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 6 = 6\n    - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 5 = 10\n    - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 6 = 12\n    - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 7 = 14\n    - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 4 = 4\n    - Total value retained = 46\n\nThis offer keeps me above my outside offer value, providing me a total value of 46, assuming Player 2 values the items differently. This proposal also respects Mistake 3 by not offering them nothing or everything.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\n- **Should I accept the current offer?** No current offer exists to accept.\n- **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?** Not yet considered since no offer is present or contrasted.\n- **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?** Yes, propose an offer that optimizes my retention of value.\n\nGiven the values and trying to appeal to Player 2, here is my decision:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]}\n```\n\nThis offer ensures I receive a value higher than my outside offer while making an initial offer that could appeal to Player 2.",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 37. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 69 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, accepting this offer would not be beneficial compared to my outside offer. \n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Accept: Since the current offer is worth less than my outside offer, accepting would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n   - Walk away: My outside offer is better, but walking away without attempting a counteroffer when there are still rounds left could miss the chance of getting a better deal.\n   - Counteroffer: I need to suggest a division such that my value from retained items exceeds 37.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer to ensure my value is greater than 37.

Let's propose a competitive yet fair counteroffer.\n\nI will propose a counteroffer that increases my value beyond 59:\n- If I offer Player 1: [2, 1, 0, 0, 0], I retain: [0, 2, 0, 1, 8].\n  - My value for this allocation:\n    - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 5 = 0\n    - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 6 = 12\n    - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 1 = 0\n    - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 10 = 10\n    - Item 5: 8 units \u00d7 9 = 72\n  - Total value = 0 + 12 + 0 + 10 + 72 = 94, which is better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to make a counteroffer that maximizes my value substantially above my outside offer value.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]}",

Since this is round 2, I should consider the present value discounted by 0.9^1 (which is 0.9).\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n     - This means I am offered:\n       - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 4 = 8\n       - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 1 = 1\n       - Total value = 8 + 1 = 9, and considering the discount factor: 9 * 0.9 = 8.1\n   - My outside offer value is 30, which is much higher than the value of the current offer (8.1).\n   - For potential counteroffers:\n     - I need to ensure the offer meets or exceeds my outside offer value of 30.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Accepting the current offer would give me value 8.1, which is worse than my outside offer of 30. Thus, Mistake 4 would occur.\n   - Walking away assures me a value of 30.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer should improve my payoff but should be evaluated to ensure it's better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's create a counteroffer:\n- I need more value, aiming for closer to or above 30 when discounted.\n- Consider offering fewer items of lower value to me, or requesting more of higher-valued ones.\n- For instance, a counteroffer that gives me more item 5 units (since they are abundant and valuable to me at 3 per unit), while offering a few items 1 and 4 units. As an initial attempt, I can offer Player 2:\n  - Keep one unit of item 1 (4 * 1 = 4)\n  - Keep no units of item 2 (0 * 1 = 0)\n  - Keep all units of item 3 (0 * 5 = 0)\n  - Keep zero units of item 4 (1 * 0 = 0)\n  - Offer only 5 units of item 5 to Player 2, keeping 3 for myself (3 * 3 = 9)\n- Total for me: 4 + 0 + 9 = 13\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer value. Let's maximize the retained high-value items further, try other combinations or walking if needed.\n\nUpon reconsideration, an optimal decision to prevent risks of Mistakes 1, 2, or 4 and secure my fallback value without extensive calculation errors is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

I need to restructure the offer items accordingly. Let's see what would be optimal:\n     - To exceed the outside offer, I should aim for a total value of at least 62.\n\n   By keeping more units with higher value to me, I need to propose a counteroffer likely to be above my outside offer while considering player 1 might reject an unfair deal. I will aim to have higher total value:\n   - Proposed counteroffer: [3, 4, 3, 1, 0]\n\n  - **Counteroffer Calculation:** (keeping 2 item 1, 3 item 2, 4 item 3, 2 item 4, 2 item 5)\n     - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n     - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n     - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n     - Total value I keep = 8 + 18 + 28 + 12 + 2 = 68, greater than 62.\n\nTherefore, I am going to make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 3, 1, 0]}\n```",

Thus, I should not accept it.\n\n   - Considering a counteroffer, I aim for a better value than my outside offer, ideally keeping high-value items:\n     - If I make a counteroffer giving Player 2: [1, 1, 2, 1, 0]\n       - I would keep (3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 1 of item 5)\n       - My value would be:\n         - 3 units of item 1 = 3 x 9 = 27\n         - 3 units of item 2 = 3 x 3 = 9\n         - 2 units of item 3 = 2 x 4 = 8\n         - 2 units of item 4 = 2 x 7 = 14\n         - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 x 5 = 5\n       - Total value = 27 + 9 + 8 + 14 + 5 = 63, which is still not better than my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Accepting the current offer is not an option as it gives a value of 46, less than my outside offer of 83.\n   - Walking away provides me with my outside offer value of 83, which is better than any deal proposed or conceivable based on my values.\n   - No counteroffer seems viable to at least match my outside offer value given the item constraints.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

I need to ensure I maintain a balance that gives me more than 83, calculating it based on attentive resource distribution.\n\nHere's a possible way to ensure I get a deal better than 83:\n- Offer Player 1: [0, 2, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCalculate what I get to keep:\n- 2-0 units of item 1 = 2 units = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n- 5-2 units of item 2 = 3 units = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n- 3-1 unit of item 3 = 2 units = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n- 7-3 units of item 4 = 4 units = 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n- 3-1 units of item 5 = 2 units = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n\nTotal value = 14 + 12 + 6 + 28 + 18 = 78, too low than my outside offer, which makes it unsustainable.\nAttempt to rebalance again.\n\nSo, let's re-evaluate parting with items:\n- Offer Player 1: [1, 3, 1, 4, 1]\n\nRe-evaluating I am hesitant to liquidate 5 units of item 4: \n\nTesting [0, 2, 1, 2, 1]:\n- Keep 2 of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n- Keep 3 of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n- Keep 2 of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n- Keep 5 of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 7 = 35\n- Keep 2 of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n\nTotal = 14 + 12 + 6 + 35 + 18 = 85\nThis total value 85 > 83 (my outside offer) suggests a surpassing of my fallback.\nThus, let me express my counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 2, 1]}",

This influences the decision as accepting earlier can yield a higher present value compared to waiting.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current offer from Player 2: [0, 2, 1, 2, 1]**:\n     - Item 1: 0 units, value = 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n     - Item 2: 2 units, value = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n     - Item 3: 1 unit, value = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - Item 4: 2 units, value = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n     - Item 5: 1 unit, value = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - Total unadjusted value = 12 + 8 + 2 + 8 = 30\n     - Discounted Value = 30 \u00d7 0.9 = 27\n   \n   Compare this to my outside offer value of 43.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 83. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 90 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the most beneficial action, follow the structured analysis:\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n- **Outside offer value = 83.**\n- **Values of the items:** \n  - Item 1: 7 per unit\n  - Item 2: 4 per unit\n  - Item 3: 3 per unit\n  - Item 4: 7 per unit\n  - Item 5: 9 per unit\n- **Total pool of items:** \n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 5 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 7 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n- **Discount factor:** Reduces the future value of offers. Current round is 2, so the value of any accepted offer is multiplied by 0.9 (gamma to the power 1).\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n- **Current offer: [1, 1, 1, 4, 1]** (Items being offered to me)\n  - Value = (1\u00d77) + (1\u00d74) + (1\u00d73) + (4\u00d77) + (1\u00d79) = 7 + 4 + 3 + 28 + 9 = 51\n  - Adjusted value with discount = 51 \u00d7 0.9 = 45.9\n\n- **Outside offer versus current offer:**\n  - Outside offer value = 83\n  - Current offer value = 45.9 (after discount)\n\nAccepting the current offer would yield less value than my outside offer.\n\n- **Consider a counteroffer:**\n  Let\u2019s aim for a division yielding more than my outside offer value of 83.\n\n  Let's calculate the value of possible counteroffers. I will keep these:\n  - Item 1: 0\n  - Item 2: 2\n  - Item 3: 2\n  - Item 4: 6\n  - Item 5: 2\n  \n  Check value of what I keep:\n  - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n  - Item 4: 6 \u00d7 7 = 42\n  - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n  Total value = 0 + 8 + 6 + 42 + 18 = 74\n\n  With the discount factor (0.9 for round 2): \n  - Total value = 74 \u00d7 0.9 = 66.6\n\nThe counteroffer doesn't surpass my outside offer either. However, to challenge Player 1 and explore an improvement slightly:\n\nI will propose a conservative counteroffer aiming to slightly exceed the outside value. Since Player 1\u2019s willingness to redistribute might vary, I will test their flexibility on higher-valued items like item 5.\n\nNew counteroffer:\n- Give Player 1: [0, 3, 1, 4, 2]\n\nKeep for myself:\n- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n- Item 3: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n- Item 5: 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- Total value = 14 + 8 + 6 + 21 + 9 = 58\n- With discount: 58 \u00d7 0.9 = 52.2\n\nAttempting this counter offer gives an exact number of items for assessment in case of negotiations alteration. Thus:\n\n**3) Decision:**\n\nThe current offer doesn't meet the outside offer, and neither does the straightforward division I tested initially. I\u2019ll propose a better counteroffer seeking a possible increase in Player 1\u2019s distribution flexibility. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 4, 2]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

The value is not reduced by the discount factor in this round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer [4, 2, 1, 1, 1]**:\n  - Value of 4 Units of Item 1 = 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n  - Value of 2 Units of Item 2 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n  - Value of 1 Units of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n  - Value of 1 Units of Item 4 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n  - Value of 1 Units of Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n  - Total Value = 36 + 4 + 8 + 3 + 6 = 57\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**:\n  - Current offer value (57) is greater than my outside offer value (50).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on Analysis\n\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**\n  - The current offer gives me a value of 57, which is higher than my outside offer of 50. Accepting this offer would provide more value than falling back on my guaranteed outside offer.\n\n- **Should I Walk Away or Counteroffer?**\n  - Walking away would leave me with a value of 50, which is less than the value of the current offer. Hence, walking away is not advantageous.\n\nSince accepting the current offer gives me a better value than my outside offer, I should accept it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Start with a proposal that gives Player 2 a minimum possible share that seems reasonable and aim for retaining a significant portion of items with high value to me.\n\nSuppose:\n- I offer Player 2: [2, 1, 2, 1, 2] units.  \nThen I keep: [2, 2, 3, 2, 2] units.\n\nCalculation of my retained value:\n\\[\n(2 \\times 8) + (2 \\times 2) + (3 \\times 10) + (2 \\times 3) + (2 \\times 4) = 16 + 4 + 30 + 6 + 8 = 64\n\\]\n\nThis value (64) is greater than my outside offer (56), thus representing a better alternative while still attempting to keep negotiations open for Player 2.\n\n### Conclusion based on the Analysis:\nSince I can achieve a retained value greater than my outside offer, making this proposal ensures that I combat Mistake 2 and provides possible room for negotiation with Player 2 in subsequent rounds.\n\nMy action:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

If accepting an offer in round 2, the value is multiplied by 0.9, and if in round 3, it's multiplied by 0.9^2 (0.81).\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Current offer: [0, 4, 0, 2, 0]\n     - Value to me if I accept it:\n       - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 6 = 0\n       - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n       - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n       - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n       - Total value = 48, which is less than my outside offer of 114.\n     - Since 48 < 114, accepting this offer is worse than my outside option; hence, I should not accept.\n     \n   - To consider a counteroffer, I need an outcome better than my outside offer of 114.\n     - Let's see a potential counteroffer which maximizes my value while still being fair:\n       - Suppose I counteroffer [0, 5, 0, 4, 1], keeping [2, 3, 2, 2, 2]:\n         - My retained value:\n           - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n           - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n           - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n           - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n           - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n           - Total value = 72, still below my outside offer of 114.\n     \n   I need to find a division that guarantees me more than my outside offer:\n\n   - Let's try a division [0, 6, 0, 4, 2], keeping [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]:\n     - My retained value:\n       - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n       - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n       - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n       - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n       - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n       - Total value = 61, again below my outside offer of 114.\n\n   It seems like it's challenging to create a division that leads to a higher value than my outside offer of 114, especially in the first round. Additionally, as these divisions aren't reaching my outside offer:\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Since the current offer provides a value of 48 (less than my outside offer of 114) and counteroffers as tried above do not reach the outside offer, making a strategic decision, I should not accept and should not make a worse counteroffer.\n   \n   Therefore, the best action without the possibility of achieving a value higher than my outside offer given the constraints is to decline the offer and make a strategic walk:\n\n   ```json\n   {\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n   ```",

I should ensure that the value of items I keep for myself is higher than my outside offer value of 10.\n\n   Let's consider initial allocations that maximize my value:\n   - Propose offering Player 2 minimal units that still result in a high payoff for me.\n\n   For an initial offer, maximize my retained value:\n   - Keep 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n   - Keep no units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - Keep 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n   - Keep 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n   - Keep 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n\n   My total value = 12 + 0 + 14 + 27 + 24 = 77\n\n   This is significantly above my outside offer value, so it's a good initial offer to make.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   Since any counteroffer should ensure my retained value is better than my outside offer of 10, propose a division that maximizes my retained item's value, without giving too much away on the first offer.\n\n   - I offer Player 2: \n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 0 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n\nThis allocation leaves me with a calculated retained value of 77, ensuring the offer I make is significantly better than my guaranteed fallback option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 42. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 81 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I should aim for a deal that gives me a higher total value than this fallback.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Proposed division:\n     * I need to determine the number of items that can give me a total value greater than my outside offer.\n\n   Since it's early in the negotiations, I should aim to receive more value initially, considering the discount factor, but not proposing something that they would immediately reject. \n\n   As an initial offer to Player 2, I will propose giving a smaller portion of each item, ensuring my kept portion gives me a high value:\n   - Offer proposal to Player 2: \n     - Item 1: 0 units (keep 2)\n     - Item 2: 2 units (keep 5)\n     - Item 3: 1 unit (keep 3)\n     - Item 4: 0 units (keep 3)\n     - Item 5: 2 units (keep 5)\n\n   Calculating my total value for this offer:\n   - Value = (2 \u00d7 1) + (5 \u00d7 4) + (3 \u00d7 10) + (3 \u00d7 2) + (5 \u00d7 6) \n   - Value = 2 + 20 + 30 + 6 + 30 = 88\n\n   This value is below my outside offer, but allows for initial negotiation leverage.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Certainly, let's analyze the current situation step by step and make an informed decision.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My outside offer value**: 41\n- **Values of items to me**:\n  - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n  - Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 9 = 45\n  - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 3 = 12\n  - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 5 = 15\n  - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 3 = 3\n  - **Total value**: 83\n- **Total pool of items available**: \n  - Item 1: 2 units\n  - Item 2: 5 units\n  - Item 3: 4 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 1 unit\n\n- **Discount factor influence**: Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn\u2019t apply yet. I am aiming for an arrangement that exceeds 41 in value to justify not taking my outside offer.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current offer**: None offered yet to assess.\n\n- **Potential counteroffers**: I need to propose an initial offer that will leave me with a value higher than my outside offer of 41. Let's evaluate potential allocations:\n\n  1. **Propose to give 0 units of each item to Player 2 and keep all for myself**:\n     - Total value = 83 (invalid, as giving 0 to Player 2 is not strategic for negotiation)\n  \n  2. **Propose to give 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5 to Player 2 (keeping the rest)**:\n     - Remaining for me:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n       - 3 units of item 2 \u00d7 9 = 27\n       - 2 units of item 3 \u00d7 3 = 6\n       - 2 units of item 4 \u00d7 5 = 10\n       - 1 unit of item 5 \u00d7 3 = 3\n     - Total value to me = 4 + 27 + 6 + 10 + 3 = 50, which is greater than my outside offer of 41.\n\nThis last option allows me to propose an offer with a total value of 50 left for me, exceeding my outside offer of 41, while still providing Player 2 with a reasonable portion of the items.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven the analysis above:\n\n- **Accept?**: No current offer to accept.\n- **Walk away?**: Not advisable since a better value is achievable.\n- **Counteroffer?**: Propose a counteroffer that lets Player 2 receive a portion, while maintaining my value higher than my outside offer.\n\nHence, I propose to give Player 2:\n\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nIn terms of an offer list: [1, 2, 2, 1, 0]\n\nHere's the action in the required format:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 1, 0]}\n```",

Delaying decisions may reduce value due to the impending discount factor in future rounds but does not affect the current round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer to evaluate for acceptance.\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffers**: Let's evaluate reasonable distributions.\n\n  A balanced offer might be to give Player 2 half of some of the items, considering the odd-numbered total units for some items, while ensuring I retain higher value.\n\n  Here's an example of a balanced division:\n  - Offer 2 units of item 1 (retain 2)\n  - Offer 3 units of item 2 (retain 3)\n  - Offer 2 units of item 3 (retain 3)\n  - Offer 2 units of item 4 (retain 3)\n  - Offer 1 unit of item 5 (retain 2)\n\nCalculating my value from retaining these:\n- Units kept for item 1: \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\)\n- Units kept for item 2: \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\)\n- Units kept for item 3: \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\)\n- Units kept for item 4: \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\)\n- Units kept for item 5: \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\)\n\nTotal value: \\(12 + 18 + 18 + 18 + 10 = 76\\)\n\n- **Comparison**: 76 compared to my outside offer of 52 indicates this counteroffer is more valuable.\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\nAs the counteroffer gives me a total value of 76, which is higher than the outside option of 52, it's a favorable offer for me. Given that this offer value is higher than the outside offer and avoids typical negotiation mistakes, I'll proceed with this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

So, I need a more favorable division.\n\n   - Consider adjusting more:\n     - Item 1: 6 (my value = 6 \u00d7 4 = 24)\n     - Item 2: 3 (my value = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15)\n     - Item 3: 4 (my value = 4 \u00d7 8 = 32)\n     - Item 4: 4 (my value = 4 \u00d7 5 = 20)\n     - Item 5: 5 (my value = 5 \u00d7 1 = 5)\n   - New calculation of my value: \n     - Total = 24 + 15 + 32 + 20 + 5 = 96\n\n   - 96 is still less than 109, so adjust further.\n\n   - Try:\n     - Item 1: 7 (my value = 7 \u00d7 4 = 28)\n     - Item 2: 3 (my value = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15)\n     - Item 3: 5 (my value = 5 \u00d7 8 = 40)\n     - Item 4: 4 (my value = 4 \u00d7 5 = 20)\n     - Item 5: 6 (my value = 6 \u00d7 1 = 6)\n   - New total value: \n     - Total = 28 + 15 + 40 + 20 + 6 = 109\n\n4) **Decision:**\n   - This setup closely matches my outside offer. However, to avoid walking away with a worse offer in mind, I must find a less drastic item division which might extract more value.\n   - Therefore, one more try:\n     - Retain:\n       - Item 1: 8 (my value = 32)\n       - Item 2: 4 (my value = 20)\n       - Item 3: 5 (my value = 40)\n       - Item 4: 5 (my value = 25)\n       - Give:\n\n   Trimming  just sufficient to prevent conflict with my fallback:\n     - My offer = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] (this retains an acceptable balance)\n\nGiven this analysis and my need to keep my outcome above my threshold (109), I can propose a division where my value stays advantageous. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

No, as it has a much lower value than my outside offer.\n   - Walk away and take the outside offer? Potentially, but I should first attempt a counteroffer that reflects a value closer to my outside offer.\n   - Propose a specific counteroffer. I need an offer worth more than or very close to the discount adjusted outside offer to justify not walking away.\n\n   - Let's devise a counteroffer aiming for a division that keeps more value and approaches 109. \n\nConsidering the analysis, I should propose an offer that I calculate has a value very close to 109. Here's my counteroffer:\n   \n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [7, 0, 2, 0, 5]}\n\n   - Calculation of this counteroffer:\n     - By giving Player 2:\n       - Item 1: 7 units \u00d7 4 value/unit = 28 (1 remaining for me)\n       - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 5 value/unit = 0 (all 4 remaining for me)\n       - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 8 value/unit = 16 (3 remaining for me)\n       - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 5 value/unit = 0 (all 5 remaining for me)\n       - Item 5: 5 units \u00d7 1 value/unit = 5 (1 remaining for me)\n     - Total for me = 1\u00d74 + 4\u00d75 + 3\u00d78 + 5\u00d75 + 1\u00d71 = 115, which is closer to my outside offer after adjustment.\n\nThe proposed counteroffer allows me to maximize the value I retain compared to the original offer while being realistic about the negotiation dynamics.",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 75\n   - Values of the items for me: \n     - Item 1: 1\n     - Item 2: 4\n     - Item 3: 6\n     - Item 4: 8\n     - Item 5: 2\n   - Total pool of items: \n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 7 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: Gamma = 0.9. If the negotiation season drags on to further rounds, the value of any agreement reached will be less than its nominal value by a factor of gamma raised to the number of rounds that have occurred.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers: \n   - There is no current offer to evaluate.\n   - For potential counteroffers, I need to keep as much value as possible by ensuring the total value of my counteroffer stays higher than my outside offer value of 75. \n   \n   Let\u2019s test a few scenarios for potential counteroffers where I keep more of the valuable items:\n   - Suppose I propose giving Player 2:\n     - 3 units of item 1 (I keep 1, worth 1 for me)\n     - 1 unit of item 2 (I keep 1, worth 4 for me)\n     - 3 units of item 3 (I keep 4, worth 24 for me)\n     - 1 unit of item 4 (I keep 2, worth 16 for me)\n     - 1 unit of item 5 (I keep 1, worth 2 for me)\n   \n   My value calculation:\n   - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n   - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n   - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n   - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n   - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n   - Total value = 1 + 4 + 24 + 16 + 2 = 47\n   \n   Total value from this counteroffer is 47, which is less than my outside offer of 75. Thus, this is not an optimal offer.\n\n   I need to ensure that the value I keep exceeds 75, factoring in the fact that I'll face a discount if the negotiation continues to later rounds.\n\n   Let's try another proposal:\n   - Give Player 2:\n     - 2 units of item 1 (I keep 2, worth 2 for me)\n     - 0 units of item 2 (I keep 2, worth 8 for me)\n     - 3 units of item 3 (I keep 4, worth 24 for me)\n     - 1 unit of item 4 (I keep 2, worth 16 for me)\n     - 0 units of item 5 (I keep 2, worth 4 for me)\n   \n   My value calculation:\n   - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n   - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n   - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n   - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n   - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n   - Total value = 2 + 8 + 24 + 16 + 4 = 54\n\n   Total value of 54 is still less than 75, let's make a more favorable offer to myself.\n\n3) Make a decision based on analysis:\n- I need a better offer. Let's reconfigure to ensure sustainability:\n   - Keep 1 unit of item 1 (worth 1 unit)\n   - Give 2 units of item 2 (ensuring all their value)\n   - Give 4 units of item 3 (giving less value but more quantity)\n   - Keep 2 units of item 4 for maximum value\n   - Give 2 units of item 5\n\nCalculated value:\n- Item 1: 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n- Item 2: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n- Item 3: 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n- Item 4: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n- Item 5: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n- Total = 3 + 0 + 18 + 16 + 0 = 37\n\nGiven that any offer should top 75 with gamma accounted, option yields unproductive.\n\nTry another range...\n---\n\nConclusively, my best preliminary observation turned invalid, illustrated ineffective:\n\nOffering whole/all will reflect capita value and by gambling offers with reserved items discounted for another might still yield less. Therefore, logical stance, safest yield is to foresee counter inferred by: maximizing limits within constraints; approximate reward in concessional midway. Hence I formulate with multi-tier groupings: only yielding organized layout pursuing surpassing minimum difference criterions?\n\nPlease confirm primary concerns of preliminary offer assessment via attribute allocation or signify if resultant understanding concurrence opts feasible adaptation:  \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 1, 0]}",

Let's go through the step-by-step process.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: 67\n- **Values of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 4\n  - Item 2: 5\n  - Item 3: 10\n  - Item 4: 7\n  - Item 5: 6\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 4 units\n  - Item 2: 2 units\n  - Item 3: 7 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 2 units\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: As the game progresses through rounds, the value of potential future offers is discounted by the factor of gamma (0.9). Thus, immediate offers have a higher face value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer (to me)**: [2, 1, 3, 1, 0]\n  - Value Calculation:\n    - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n    - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 5 = 5\n    - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 10 = 30\n    - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 7 = 7\n    - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 6 = 0\n  - Total value of accepting the offer = 8 + 5 + 30 + 7 + 0 = 50\n\n- **Comparison**:\n  - Total value of current offer (50) is less than my outside offer (67).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nGiven that the current offer is worth less than my outside offer, accepting it would mean making the mistake of accepting an offer worse than the outside offer (Mistake 4). Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\n### Counteroffer Consideration\nI need to propose a counteroffer that would give me a value greater than 67. Let's assume I counteroffer by providing fewer items to Player 1:\n\n- **Proposed Counteroffer to Player 1**: [1, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n  - My share would be: \n    - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 4 = 12\n    - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 5 = 10\n    - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 10 = 40\n    - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 7 = 21\n    - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 6 = 12\n  - Total value = 12 + 10 + 40 + 21 + 12 = 95\n\nSince 95 is greater than my outside offer of 67, this counteroffer improves my position.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a decision, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 10\n   - Values of the items I have: \n     - Item 1: 8\n     - Item 2: 1\n     - Item 3: 10\n     - Item 4: 9\n     - Item 5: 5\n   - Total pool of items: \n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor influences the value of waiting because the negotiation game's present value of the outcome decreases with each round by the factor of gamma. Therefore, securing a deal sooner is potentially more valuable than later, all else being equal.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: None.\n   - Potential offer(s): Since this is the first move, my task is to make a reasonable counteroffer that maximizes my portion of the total value while ensuring it's better than my outside offer of 10.\n   \n     To ensure an offer is better than my outside offer, let's consider maximizing my value from the high-value items like item 3 and item 4, which are worth 10 and 9 per unit, respectively.\n\n   Consider making an offer that gives Player 2 some low-value items (to me), such as item 2, and fewer units of high-value items:\n\n   Let's compute the value:\n   - If I offer Player 2: \n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 5\n     \n     I keep:\n     - 2 units of item 1 (value = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16)\n     - 5 units of item 3 (value = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50)\n     - 3 units of item 4 (value = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27)\n     - 3 units of item 5 (value = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15)\n\n   My total value for the remaining items = 16 + 50 + 27 + 15 = 108, which is considerably higher than my outside value of 10, and does not include units of item 2 which have low value to me.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n- I should propose a specific counteroffer that respects the game rules and maximizes my value.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 29.\n   - The values of the items for me are:\n     - Item 1: 9\n     - Item 2: 1\n     - Item 3: 10\n     - Item 4: 5\n     - Item 5: 8\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   - The discount factor affects future rounds by reducing the effective value received if the negotiation proceeds to further rounds. However, since we are in round 1, it does not yet apply.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [4, 0, 1, 1, 0] is offered to me, which means I receive 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n     - Value of current offer to me = (4 * 9) + (0 * 1) + (1 * 10) + (1 * 5) + (0 * 8) = 36 + 0 + 10 + 5 + 0 = 51\n   - My current offer value of 51 is greater than my outside offer value of 29.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Since the value of the current offer (51) exceeds my outside offer value (29), and we are in the first round (with no discount to apply yet), accepting this offer is favorable.\n\nTherefore, the best action is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

An effective strategy can be to start conservative, aiming to retain maximum value.\n\n3) **Calculate the value I need to achieve:**\n\n   Since my outside offer is 92, any acceptable offer I counter should net me value equal to or greater than 92.\n\n   **Example Counteroffer:**\n   - Offer Player 2: [0, 1, 3, 0, 1]\n   - My items left:\n     - 2 units of Item 1: \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\)\n     - 2 units of Item 2: \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n     - 2 units of Item 3: \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\)\n     - 3 units of Item 4: \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\)\n     - 1 unit of Item 5: \\(1 \\times 7 = 7\\)\n   - Total value: \\(20 + 2 + 14 + 24 + 7 = 67\\)\n\n   This is below my outside offer of 92. I need to reassess and keep more valuable items to approach the target value, making sure not to violate mistake: proposing a worse offer than my outside offer.\n\n   **Propose a new conservative counteroffer:**\n   - Offer Player 2: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n   - My items left:\n     - 2 units of Item 1: \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\)\n     - 2 units of Item 2: \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n     - 4 units of Item 3: \\(4 \\times 7 = 28\\)\n     - 3 units of Item 4: \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\)\n     - 2 units of Item 5: \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\)\n   - Total value: \\(20 + 2 + 28 + 24 + 14 = 88\\)\n\n   This is still below 92, so I need further adjustment. Let\u2019s achieve exactly the target by taking maximum values:\n\n   - Offer Player 2: [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]\n   - My items left:\n     - 2 units of Item 1: \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\)\n     - 1 unit of Item 2: \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n     - 4 units of Item 3: \\(4 \\times 7 = 28\\)\n     - 2 units of Item 4: \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\)\n     - 2 units of Item 5: \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\)\n   - Total value: \\(20 + 1 + 28 + 16 + 14 = 79\\)\n\nSo let me correct it and keep revising again:\n\n   - **Acceptable Counteroffer Calculation Refined:**  \n     - Give just enough items that maximize my side, ensuring at least my own fallback value, and optimum start point to negotiate:\n\nHere\u2019s my valid counteroffer for Player 2, maximizing my received value >= outside offer: \n\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 4, 2, 0]} ",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the current situation step by step.\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 92.\n\n- **Values of Items Involved**:\n  - Item 1: 10\n  - Item 2: 1\n  - Item 3: 7\n  - Item 4: 8\n  - Item 5: 7\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: Since it's round 3, there's no future round; thus, gamma does not further apply beyond this point.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n  - I receive:\n    - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n    - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n    - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n    - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n  - **Total value if I accept**: 0 + 1 + 7 + 8 + 7 = 23\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**: 23 (from accepting the offer) is significantly less than my outside offer of 92.\n\n- **Counteroffer Evaluation**: To receive a value greater than 92, I need a division where the items I keep contribute at least 92 in total value:\n  - If I keep all (2, 0, 4, 2, 2), my calculation is:\n    - 2 \u00d7 10 = 20 (item 1)\n    - 0 \u00d7 1 = 0 (item 2)\n    - 4 \u00d7 7 = 28 (item 3)\n    - 2 \u00d7 8 = 16 (item 4)\n    - 2 \u00d7 7 = 14 (item 5)\n    - **Total value**: 20 + 0 + 28 + 16 + 14 = 78 (still less than 92)\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\n- **Accept the Current Offer?**: No, as the value of this offer (23) is far below my outside offer (92).\n\n- **Walk Away?**: This guarantees a value of 92, which is higher than any potential outcome.\n\n- **Propose a Counteroffer?**: Since no division allows me to achieve a value greater than 92, all possible offers would inherently be worse than simply accepting my outside offer. Thus, making a counteroffer would not benefit me.\n\nGiven that none of the calculations yield a value greater than my outside offer, and to avoid Mistakes 2 and 5, the rational choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

It is 0.9, which will apply to outcomes in rounds beyond the first.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer:** Player 1 has offered me [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]. \n  - Value Calculation:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 10 = 10\n    - 0 units of item 2 = 0 * 7 = 0\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 2 = 4\n    - 0 units of item 4 = 0 * 3 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 8 = 8\n  - Total Value = 10 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 8 = 22\n\n- **Comparison:** \n  - Value from current offer: 22\n  - Outside offer: 30\n\nSince the current offer's value (22) is less than my outside offer (30), accepting it would be a mistake based on Mistake 4 (accepting an offer worse than your outside offer).\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\nGiven that the current offer is worse than my outside option, I should either walk away or make a counteroffer.\n\n- **Formulating a Counteroffer:** I need to propose an offer that ensures my value from the remaining items is greater than 30. \n\nLet's try a counteroffer:\n- Offer to Player 1:\n  - 0 units of Item 1 (worth 10 each)\n  - 1 unit of Item 2 (worth 7 each, leaving me 1 unit worth 7)\n  - 3 units of Item 3 (worth 2 each, leaving me 4 units worth 8)\n  - 0 units of Item 4 (worth 3 each, leaving me 1 unit worth 3)\n  - 2 units of Item 5 (worth 8 each, leaving me 2 units worth 16)\n\nThe value for me with this counteroffer:\n- 3 units of Item 1 = 3 * 10 = 30\n- 1 unit of Item 2 = 1 * 7 = 7\n- 4 units of Item 3 = 4 * 2 = 8\n- 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 * 3 = 3\n- 2 units of Item 5 = 2 * 8 = 16\n- Total Value for me = 30 + 7 + 8 + 3 + 16 = 64, which is more than 30. \n\nThis proposal ensures my value is above the outside offer, avoiding Mistake 2 (making an offer worse for you than your outside offer).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI will proceed with providing a counteroffer that improves my value above my outside offer of 30.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

At round 2, the value is adjusted by gamma^1 = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer**: [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]\n     - My total if I accept:\n       - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 $7 = $7\n       - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 $5 = $15\n       - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 $8 = $16\n     - Total value = $7 + $15 + $16 = $38\n     - Adjusted for discount: $38 \u00d7 0.9 = $34.2\n   \n   - Compare current offer value ($34.2) to my outside offer value ($67). The outside offer guarantees more value.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer would give me less value than my outside offer ($34.2 < $67), so I should not accept it.\n   - Walking away would secure me my outside offer value of $67, which is higher than the current offer adjusted by the discount.\n   - Consider a counteroffer that might give me a total higher than $67 when adjusted by the discount.\n\n   Evaluating a potential counteroffer:\n   Let's propose keeping all items that give us maximum value while considering a fair offer to Player 2 to maximize our own outcome keeping the most valuable items:\n\n   My allocation proposal for maximum self-value:\n   - Keep: [3, 1, 6, 1, 2] (to me) considering maximizing my values\n   - Offer to Player 2: [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\n   - Calculate value for me (keeping 3, 1, 6, 1, 2):\n       - Value = 3\u00d710 + 1\u00d77 + 6\u00d75 + 1\u00d78 + 2\u00d78\n       - Value = 30 + 7 + 30 + 8 + 16 = 91\n   - Adjust for discount: 91 \u00d7 0.9 = 81.9 \n\n   Since 81.9 > 67, the counteroffer value adjusted for discount is greater than my outside offer.\n\n   Thus, I will propose that counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

Waiting decreases the value of the future offer by 10%.\n\n2) **Assessing the Current Offer:**\n\nCurrent offer:\n- [0, 1, 1, 0, 2] being offered to me, which means I receive:\n  - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n  - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n  - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n- Total value if I accept the current offer: 7 + 2 + 16 = **25**\n\n3) **Comparison to My Outside Offer:**\n\n- Current offer value (25) is less than my outside offer value (30).

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 10. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 69 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 23. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 87 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Possible item allocation could maximize my value as follows:\n\n- **Example Counteroffer [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]**: I keep [2, 0, 1, 2, 4]\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n  - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n  - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n  - Total value = 58\n\nThis counteroffer yields me a value of 58, which is much higher than both the current offer and the outside offer. \n\n### Decision\nMy choice should not conflict with my objectives, nor should any errors be made by accepting a lesser value offer or walking away from potential better offers. I will propose this counteroffer to the other player for maximizing my value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

To ensure I avoid Mistake 2, the counteroffer should ensure I get a value higher than my outside offer of 88.\n\n     To achieve this without making Mistake 3 or 5, a potential offer could be structured where I'm left with:\n\n     My goal is to retain a total value greater than 88.\n\n     Example Offer to Player 2:\n\n     If I offer 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5, I keep:\n     \n     - Item 1: 1 unit -> 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n     - Item 2: 1 unit -> 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n     - Item 3: 2 units -> 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - Item 4: 4 units -> 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n     - Item 5: 4 units -> 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\n     \n     Total value to me = 7 + 6 + 8 + 24 + 8 = 53\n     \n     This offer gives my opponent a less attractive offer by giving myself fewer units which would not cover my goal value of 88. \n     \n     Let's suggest more units to me:\n\n     To achieve a higher value closer to 88:\n\n     - Item 1: 2 units remaining -> worth 14\n     - Item 2: 2 units remaining -> worth 12\n     - Item 3: 3 units -> worth 12\n     - Item 4: 5 units -> worth 30\n     - Item 5: 6 units -> worth 12\n\n     Total for me = 14 + 12 + 12 + 30 + 12 = 80, light improvement closer to target\n\n     I will reconsider and aim to retain:\n     - Item 1: 2 (maximizing at 14)\n     - Item 2: 1 (Smaller unit retention)\n     - Item 3: 3 (eight retention units)\n     - Item 4: 6 (extending more size, closer total value)\n     - Item 5: 6 (stronger proposition retained over half)\n\n     Final split:\n     - Give Player 2: 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n\n     I need to further engage POTENTIAL larger areas of selection:\n\n     - Change to 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2(Box 8), 1 of item 3(Box 8) \n\n     Re-analysis, keeping more:\n\n     Final revised results:\n     - Offer Player 2: 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n     \n     Retain:\n     - 1 of item 1: not received (back-quarter retain all likely)\n     - 1 unit of item 2: (gain small edge minor units avoid loss)\n     - nearing 3 item 3: Avoid similar adverse effect\n     - 6 item 4: approximate max size observation\n     - 5 item 5: observe a final total backside outcome\n  \n     I will COUNTEROFFER with this division:\n\n     {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 4]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 46. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 78 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means the value of keeping negotiations open is slightly less valuable due to decreasing present value of future rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer** from Player 1, meant for me:\n     - Offered to me: 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n     - Calculate total value:\n       - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 1 = 0\n       - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 7 = 21\n       - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 7 = 7\n       - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 5 = 10\n       - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 1 = 3\n       - Total = 41\n     - Discount for round 1: 41\n    \n     The value of this offer is 41, which is less than my outside offer of 82. \n\n3) **Decision:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is not favorable as it offers a significantly lower value (41) compared to my outside offer (82).\n   - Walking away would yield a value of 82, which is guaranteed.\n\nSince the current offer is unacceptable and I have a better outside offer, I should reject this and make a counteroffer that has a potential to be closer to or exceeds my outside offer value while also being realistic for negotiations. \n\nOne potentially strategic counteroffer could keep more of items 2 and 3 because they have higher values to me, or I could aim to keep certain numbers of each item to match or exceed a value close to my outside option. To avoid Mistake 2, I'll ensure any counteroffer provides me above or around 82 in value, considering the negotiation dynamics and attempt for an effective counter.\n\n**Calculating a potential counteroffer for strategic negotiation:**\n\n   - Offer Player 1: 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n   - My kept items:\n     - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 1 = 1\n     - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 7 = 28\n     - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 7 = 21\n     - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 5 = 15\n     - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 1 = 2\n     - Total value = 67\n\nSince this calculated value (67) still doesn't compare favorably to my outside option, but due to negotiation restrictions of avoiding proposing an all-or-nothing deal (Mistake 3), I need to propose a more realistic counteroffer focusing negotiation dynamics rather than immediate defection.\n\nHowever, sacrificing value intentionally would still lead to unfavorable scenarios based on available analysis. Therefore, I'll prioritize walking away considering current dynamics.\n\nFor now, based on analysis and decision-making strategy, my action would be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 33. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 42 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Thus, any counteroffer that leaves me with less than 33 value is not acceptable. As such, to propose a fair and logical offer, I should aim to hold onto high-value items for maximum benefit while still ensuring player 2 finds the offer potentially attractive. Since the calculated value doesn't sufficiently meet my outside offer value, we need to propose a more advantageous counteroffer and reconsider item allocation to maximize our potential gain while aligning with our fallback value.\n\n   Here's my structured counteroffer moving forward with a slightly different allocation:\n\n   Offer the other player:\n   - 0 units of item 1\n   - 3 units of item 2\n   - 0 units of item 3\n   - 2 units of item 4\n   - 4 units of item 5\n\nLet's evaluate again:\n- Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3 (3 units for me * $6 = 18 value for item 1)\n- Item 2: 5 - 3 = 2 (2 units for me * $2 = 4 value for item 2)\n- Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1 (1 unit for me * $3 = 3 value for item 3)\n- Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3 (3 units for me * $2 = 6 value for item 4)\n- Item 5: 5 - 4 = 1 (1 unit for me * $1 = 1 value for item 5)\n\nTotal Value = 18 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 1 = 32\n\nYet again, it's found that offer fails in reaching a full value justifying the outside offer. Therefore, optimizing allocation takes priority. However, as a realization of misstep adaptation, I need to retain 3 units of item 4 adding valuable leverage to bolster the final offer while redistributing items.\n\n   Offer:\n   - 0 units of item 1\n   - 3 units of item 2\n   - 0 units of item 3\n   - 2 units of item 4\n   - 5 units of item 5\n\nReassess full value retention:\n  - Item 1: 3 (retained value: 18)\n  - Item 2: 2 (retained value: 4)\n  - Item 3: 1 (retained value: 3)\n  - Item 4: 3 (retained value: 6)\n  - Item 5: 0 (retained value: 0)\n\nAggregate present value totals: 31 achievable ending with the intention slightly under the fallback option demands while being reasonable.\n\nAdjusted solution then gravitates override current premise by emphasizing adaptability. Hence integrated counter now potentiates:\n  Offer:\n   - 0 units of item 1\n   - 2 units of item 2\n   - 0 units of item 3\n   - 3 units of item 4\n   - 5 units of item 5\n\nRecalibrated retention translates:\n  - Item 1: 18\n  - Item 2: 6\n  - Item 3: 3\n  - Item 4: conflicting, deemed with alternative allocation.\n  - Item 5: 0 utmost potential benefit counteracting absence present value.\n\nAggregate meticulous recapture: 33 optimal settling prime justifiability. Counter adjustment solidifies valid expectation while satisfied:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 3, 5]}\n```\nThe offer stands robust and maximizes potential without jeopardizing outside threshold, proceeding congruent toward strategic satisfaction.",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

So, it is beneficial to reach a conclusion earlier, if possible.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer to me: **None**, so I have nothing to value here.\n   - I want to maximize my value out of a total potential value of \\(3 \\times 4 + 2 \\times 9 + 6 \\times 1 + 8 \\times 2 + 4 \\times 9 = 12 + 18 + 6 + 16 + 36 = 88\\).\n\n   Given that my outside offer is very low (1), almost any reasonable division should offer me a value greater than walking away. I should aim for a division that maximizes my value, keeping in mind I need to make a fair offer to Player 2 to avoid a walk.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - If I were to offer Player 2 a division where I retain the majority of higher-valued items for me, I must ensure that it's a reasonable offer for Player 2 as well. Let's consider an initial offer that keeps me valuable items while maintaining fairness:\n     - Offer Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n     - For myself, I retain: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n\n   Let's calculate my total value for keeping this division:\n   - My value = (2 \u00d7 4) + (1 \u00d7 9) + (3 \u00d7 1) + (4 \u00d7 2) + (2 \u00d7 9) = 8 + 9 + 3 + 8 + 18 = 46.\n\n   As 46 is considerably higher than my outside offer of 1, this offer is attractive for me, as losing out on the opportunity by making an unattractive offer to Player 2 would not be prudent.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to make this initial offer. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 4, 2]}",

I need to propose an initial offer that ensures my total value is higher than my outside offer value.\n\nTo maximize my utility, I'll evaluate potential counteroffers by calculating their respective values:\n\nLet's explore offering the opponent some items that are of lower value to me:\n1. Let's assume I offer them minimal valuable units to test the waters:\n   - Offer Player 2: \n     - 0 of Item 1 (0 value for me)\n     - 1 of Item 2 (1 \u00d7 3 = 3 value for me) - reducing one specific unit given\n     - 1 of Item 3 (3 \u00d7 7 = 21 value for me)\n     - 3 of Item 4 (1 \u00d7 3 = 3 value for me)\n     - 5 of Item 5 (1 \u00d7 1 = 1 value for me)\n\nHere, I'm retaining significant amounts of items 1, 3, and part of 4 and 5. Let\u2019s calculate:\n\n- Keeping for myself:\n  - 4 units of Item 1 = 4 \u00d7 8 = 32 (maximum valuable units retained)\n  - 3 units of Item 2 = (total in pool, offering 1) 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 \n  - 3 units of Item 3 = (keeping 2 from pool) 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n  - 1 unit of Item 4 = (keeping one but less valuable to me) 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n  - 1 unit of Item 5 = (keeping one but again less valuable) 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n\n**Total Value** to me with above strategy: 32 + 6 + 14 + 3 + 1 = 56\n\nThis is higher than my outside offer of 43. Thus, it aligns well with maximizing immediate payoff and preparing for negotiation flexibility.\n\n### 3) Make a decision:\nGiven that this counteroffer gives me a higher value than my outside offer and tests Player 2's willingness, I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 3, 5]}\n``` \n\nThis offer provides some room for negotiation without risking my position below outside offer value.",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 73. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 84 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 3, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 3, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's go through the steps outlined:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 73.\n   - Values of items to me:\n     - Item 1: 1\n     - Item 2: 4\n     - Item 3: 7\n     - Item 4: 8\n     - Item 5: 8\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor (gamma) is 0.9 for rounds beyond the first.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current offer from Player 1** is [0, 1, 1, 3, 5], so the items I receive are [4, 2, 3, 1, 1]:\n     - My value: \n       - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 1 = 4\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - Total value from this offer = 4 + 8 + 21 + 8 + 8 = 49\n   - Compare this to my outside offer value of 73:\n     - My outside offer is substantially higher than the current offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - The current offer's value (49) is significantly less than my outside offer (73). Accepting the current offer would be a mistake since it provides less value than my guaranteed fallback.\n   - I should not accept the current offer.\n   - Walking away is better than accepting this offer.\n\nSince my goal is to maximize my outcome and the current offer doesn't meet my outside offer value, I will make a counteroffer that provides a better situation for me than currently proposed.\n\nLet's construct a counteroffer that might be more favorable for both:\n   - My original values with all items is 124, my target is above 73 (my outside offer).\n   - An example division that could work: [2, 1, 2, 3, 4] for the other player, which leaves me [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]:\n     - Calculation of my values:\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n       - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n     - Total value = 2 + 8 + 14 + 8 + 16 = 48\n\n   Now let's try another counteroffer that's better for me, like [1, 1, 2, 3, 5] for the other player, which leaves me [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - Total value = 3 + 8 + 14 + 8 + 8 = 41\n\nLet's finalize a counteroffer that's even closer to 73:\n   - Counteroffer: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3] for the other player, which leaves me [3, 2, 2, 1, 3]:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n     - Total value = 3 + 8 + 14 + 8 + 24 = 57\n\nNone of these currently surpasses 73, but a better counterbalance to negotiate more or walk next round: Next counteroffer [0, 1, 2, 1, 1] to the player leaving me with [4, 2, 2, 3, 5]:\n     - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 1 = 4\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n     - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n     - Total value = 4 + 8 + 14 + 24 + 40 = 90\n\nThis satisfies higher than my outside offer, therefore, my counter offer will be. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]}",

Since it's round 2, any value obtained will be reduced by gamma^1 = 0.9.\n\n2) Assessing the value of the current offer:\n   - Current offer: [0, 0, 2, 1, 5]\n   - My value if I accept:\n     - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n     - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n     - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - Item 5: 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n   - Total value if I accept = 14 + 8 + 40 = 62\n   - Adjusted for discount: 62 \u00d7 0.9 = 55.8\n\n3) Comparing the current offer to my outside offer:\n   - 55.8 (current offer value adjusted for round 2) < 73 (outside offer)\n\n4) Assess the potential counteroffers:\n   - To make a counteroffer better than the outside offer value, I need to retain items whose total value > 73 after adjustment.\n   - Let's propose a counteroffer where I try to keep more valuable items and give away less. For example, keeping more of item 4 and item 5.\n\nProposed counteroffer: [0, 1, 2, 2, 4]\n- Calculation of my value:\n  - I keep: \n    - Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4 units = 4 \u00d7 1 = 4\n    - Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n    - Item 3: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n    - Item 4: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n    - Item 5: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n  - My total value = 4 + 8 + 14 + 16 + 16 = 58\n  - Adjusted for discount in round 2: 58 \u00d7 0.9 = 52.2\n  - The value of this counteroffer is not higher than my outside offer.\n\nThe proposed counteroffer also doesn't sufficiently surpass the current table value either. I should make sure the value of the outcome should be more than 73 post-adjustment.\n\nAfter evaluating all this information, I will choose to walk away, as both the current offer and my potential counteroffers do not exceed my outside offer after accounting for the discount in round 2.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine the optimal action, let's start by analyzing the situation as outlined in your questions.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 64.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 9 (but there are 0 units, so it doesn't matter)\n     - Item 2: 7\n     - Item 3: 5\n     - Item 4: 7\n     - Item 5: 3\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 0 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) means the value of any accepted offer will diminish as rounds progress. In round 1, this factor doesn't affect the calculations as much for making the first offer, but accepting or proposing can significantly alter outcomes in later rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer on the table. I need to make an initial offer.\n   - To decide on a counteroffer, I need to ensure the value retained is higher than my outside offer of 64.\n   - Calculate potential offers by retaining more items that have higher value to me (items 2 and 4).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the above analysis:**\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my retained value over 64.\n\nLet's calculate the value of some possible distributions and compare to my outside offer:\n\n- **Keep all of item 2 (4 units), 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5:**\n  - My retained units and respective values would be:\n    - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n    - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n    - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n  - Total value = 28 + 5 + 21 + 3 = 57\n\nThis total value of 57 is less than my outside offer of 64. Hence, this allocation would not be appropriate.\n\n- **Alternative offer**: \n  - Keep 3 units of item 2, all of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5:\n     - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n     - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n   - Total value = 21 + 10 + 14 + 0 = 45\n\nThis total value is also less than my outside offer, and offering all my less valued items without thinking can constitute a negotiation as per Mistake 3. Therefore, more balanced offers should be considered.\n\nContinuing to optimize:\n- Split item 2 evenly, keep 1 item 3 only, split item 4 evenly.\n\n- **Counteroffer:**\n  - Offer: 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 unit of item 5.\n  - My retained items would be:\n    - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n    - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n    - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n    - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n  - Total value = 14 + 10 + 14 + 0 = 38\n\nDue to the ongoing discovery that none of the division permutations seem to directly exceed the 64 threshold key (the resulting total diminution product significantly becomes lower), Conservative and balanced propositions avoid straight wrongdoing. \n\nTherefore, I'd carefully start suggesting broader mixings in upcoming terms, hoping other party values differ significantly, giving room to settler. For initial proposals, unseen blockages (wider forced provisions guaranteeing significant interest disposal or indirect alternate pathways) lay validity limits on offering strictiously according & immediate.\n\nGiven the above considerations and iterative attempting to successfully bypass sufficiency passages, I'll make a reasonable **COUNTEROFFER**. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- 2 items of item 2 (worth 14)\n- 1 item of item 3 (worth 5)\n- 2 items of item 4 (worth 14)\n- 1 item of item 5 (worth 3)\n\nTotal value to me: 14 + 5 + 14 + 3 = 36. No direct premium yields perhaps round-iteration summations, actions lie yet cooperative valuation expectancy strife to exceed outside drawroom preference values retaining layers openly ingenuity. The mindful proposal significantly attempts negotiated reach higher expectations. \n\nThis offers balanced item quantity, is progressive without combative disparity conflict (an effect of discount rates readily averages evenly to accord threshold of optimal dissolutions) tackling emerging warrant differing stand moment processing structurally rename degree halves equivalences.",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 150. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 96 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 7. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 90 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Therefore, accepting the current offer will maximize my payoff compared to the alternative of walking away.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since we're in round 1, this doesn't affect our decision immediately but should be considered for future rounds if negotiations aren't resolved in this round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\nSince there is no current offer on the table, I need to propose an initial offer. To ensure my offer is favorable compared to my outside value of 48:\n\n**Let's assume an initial fair distribution. I will calculate my total value based on potential offers to Player 2.**\n\n- **Counteroffer A (Proposal):**\n  - Offer 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2.\n  - Keep the rest for myself: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n\n**Value Calculation for Me (Counteroffer A):**\n   - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n   - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 7 = 14\n   - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 7 = 14\n   - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 2 = 6\n   - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20\n   - Total value for me = 8 + 14 + 14 + 6 + 20 = 62\n\nSince 62 is greater than my outside offer value of 48, this is a valid starting point.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nBased on my analysis, I should propose Counteroffer A as it is advantageous compared to my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

The total value is also too low to accept even when considering the discount factor. Similarly, it makes little sense to walk away right now as this is only the early stage of the negotiation, and we can possibly extract more value.\n\nLet's work on a counteroffer. I need a counteroffer such that:\n- My total calculated value is greater than the outside offer.\n- The remainder of items (what I keep) maximizes my benefit.\n\n#### Counteroffer Strategy:\nTo maximize value, let's aim to hold onto high-value items for myself while giving more of low-value items in return.\n\nProposed Counteroffer: [0, 1, 3, 3, 3]\n- Keeping for myself:\n  - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n  - 2 units of Item 2 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n  - 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1 \n  - 2 units of Item 4 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n  - 5 units of Item 5 = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20\n- **Total value if I keep this configuration:** 21 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 62\n\nEven this hasn't achieved a value over 93, hence I may need to walk unless I can make offer values improve for the counterparty.\n\nFinal decision \u2013 due to the high valuation of my outside offer and declining the current state which is too low:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "To decide on the appropriate action, let's analyze the current situation and potential outcomes step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 52.\n   - **Values of Items:**\n     - Item 1: 8 per unit\n     - Item 2: 9 per unit\n     - Item 3: 8 per unit\n     - Item 4: 2 per unit\n     - Item 5: 5 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:** \n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   - **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.9, which means the present value is slightly less in future rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer (offered to me):** [1, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n     - Value Calculation:\n       - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n       - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n       - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n       - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n     - Total value = 8 + 0 + 16 + 2 + 10 = 36\n     - Since 36 is less than my outside offer of 52, accepting this offer would not be beneficial.\n   \n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n     - I need to ensure any counteroffer has a total value greater than 52 to be better than my outside offer.\n     - I could consider proposing to keep more of the high-value items such as item 2 and item 1, where my values are highest.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nGiven the current offer provides me with value (36) less than my outside offer (52), I should not accept it. Instead, I need to propose a counteroffer that ensures my value is at least greater than 52, or if I cannot achieve that, consider walking away.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal Strategy:**\n- To maximize value, let's attempt to keep all units of item 2, and adjust the distribution of other items:\n\n  Counteroffer where I keep:\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n  - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n  - Total value: 24 + 9 + 32 + 4 + 15 = 84\n\nThus, the counteroffer I can propose to Player 1 based on this calculation is to give them 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5, ensuring my value exceeds my outside offer.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To decide on the best action, let's evaluate the current situation and the offer made by Player 1.\n\n### Analyze the Current Situation\n\n1. **Outside Offer Value:**\n   - My outside offer value is 20.\n\n2. **Values of the Items:**\n   - Item 1: 8 per unit\n   - Item 2: 6 per unit\n   - Item 3: 9 per unit\n   - Item 4: 7 per unit\n   - Item 5: 10 per unit\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items:**\n   - 5 units of item 1\n   - 6 units of item 2\n   - 6 units of item 3\n   - 3 units of item 4\n   - 3 units of item 5\n\n4. **Current Offer Impact:**\n   The current offer gives me the following:\n   - Item 1: 0 units = \\(0 \\times 8 = 0\\)\n   - Item 2: 0 units = \\(0 \\times 6 = 0\\)\n   - Item 3: 3 units = \\(3 \\times 9 = 27\\)\n   - Item 4: 1 unit = \\(1 \\times 7 = 7\\)\n   - Item 5: 1 unit = \\(1 \\times 10 = 10\\)\n   - **Total Value if I Accept: \\(0 + 0 + 27 + 7 + 10 = 44\\)**\n\n5. **Discount Factor Influence:**\n   - Since we're in round 1, the discount factor is not yet applied to any received offer. Future rounds will have their value multiplied by \\(\\gamma^{(r-1)}\\), where \\(r\\) is the current round number.\n\n### Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- The current offer yields a total value of 44, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 20. Accepting this offer is advantageous unless I believe a better offer could be negotiated.\n\n### Decision\n\nBy analyzing my current position, the current offer provides a higher value (44) compared to my outside offer (20). According to Mistake 5, I should not walk away from an offer better than my outside offer. Given this, I'll proceed as follows:\n\n- **Action:** Accept the current offer because it provides significantly more value than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",
