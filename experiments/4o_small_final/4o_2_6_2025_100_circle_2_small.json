It must be adjusted:\n\nA counteroffer must maximize total as close or above 70 post discount:\n\nTry a more aggressive offer:\n- Offer: [0, 3, 3, 2, 1]\n- Remaining for me: [2, 2, 1, 3, 1]\n\n**Re-calculate Remaining Value:**\n- Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20\n- Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 1 = 2\n- Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 3 = 3\n- Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 8 = 24\n- Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 5 = 5\n\n**Total Value to Me:**\n- Total Value = 20 + 2 + 3 + 24 + 5 = 54\n- Discounted Value = 54 * 0.9 = 48.6\n\nUnfortunately, achieving a total discounted value of 70 is quite complicated within limits of items and counteroffers. Hence, I may need to communicate to secure value as close to my outside offer as possible accepting risk of offering as negotiation equilibrates.\n\nTherefore, rather than risking a potential walk away error, discouragement on derived deficit in value, I'll persistently accept more fair shares. Yet, through review, my action leans toward justifying resulting optimal:\n\nContinuing, let's attempt closer engineered strategy yet maintaining balance:\n\nTry additional amended counter (within strategic reasoning): \n\nMy final approach remains \u2014 modifying: \n- Offer: [1, 3, 2, 2, 1] \n\nThe reasoning optimizes for future metric in compromise/success constraint.\n\nCalculate adjusted value distribution: \nRemaining: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n\nValue Achievement:\n- Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 10 = 10\n- Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 1 = 2\n- Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 3 = 6\n- Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 8 = 24\n- Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 5 = 5\n- Total Calc = 10 + 2 + 6 + 24 + 5 = 47\n- Final = 47 * 0.9 = ~42.3 which atypically guided to conclude achieving via compromise not precisely 70 reductionary basis.\n\nAdaptively thus speculative:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 2, 2, 1]}",

I aim to keep items with the highest value per unit, especially item 5 (value 10 per unit), item 3 (value 9 per unit), and item 2 (value 8 per unit).\n\nA reasonable initial offer could be:\n- Item 1: Offer 3/3 (0 left) \n- Item 2: Offer 4/6 (2 left for me)\n- Item 3: Offer 1/2 (1 left for me)\n- Item 4: Offer 3/3 (0 left)\n- Item 5: Offer 0/2 (2 left for me)\n\nCalculating my value if this offer is accepted:\n- Value of 0 Item 1 = 0 * 2 = 0\n- Value of 2 Item 2 = 2 * 8 = 16\n- Value of 1 Item 3 = 1 * 9 = 9\n- Value of 0 Item 4 = 0 * 2 = 0\n- Value of 2 Item 5 = 2 * 10 = 20\n- Total value = 0 + 16 + 9 + 0 + 20 = 45\n\nThis initial offer doesn't provide enough value to justify a deal, so I need to adjust. Let's try a slightly different configuration focusing on keeping items high in value:\n\nUpdate:\n- Item 1: Offer 3/3 (0 left)\n- Item 2: Offer 3/6 (3 left for me)\n- Item 3: Offer 1/2 (1 left for me)\n- Item 4: Offer 3/3 (0 left)\n- Item 5: Offer 0/2 (2 left for me)\n\nCalculating my value:\n- Value of 0 Item 1 = 0 * 2 = 0\n- Value of 3 Item 2 = 3 * 8 = 24\n- Value of 1 Item 3 = 1 * 9 = 9\n- Value of 0 Item 4 = 0 * 2 = 0\n- Value of 2 Item 5 = 2 * 10 = 20\n- Total value = 0 + 24 + 9 + 0 + 20 = 53\n\nStill not meeting my outside offer value. Ultimately, since it's impossible to meet my 90 outside offer with the distribution available, I'll maximize my utility with a fairer distribution:\n\n- Item 2: Offer 2/6, keeping 4\n- Item 3: Offer 0/2, keeping 2\n- Item 5: Offer 0/2, keeping 2\n\nCalculating:\n\n- Value of 0 Item 1 = 0 * 2 = 0\n- Value of 4 Item 2 = 4 * 8 = 32\n- Value of 2 Item 3 = 2 * 9 = 18\n- Value of 0 Item 4 = 0 * 2 = 0\n- Value of 2 Item 5 = 2 * 10 = 20\n- Total value = 32 + 18 + 20 = 70\n\nEven after optimizing for priority, still suboptimal but can improve with negotiation, considering drastic changes under poor initial table position.

The current offer is not satisfactory in comparison to my outside offer. Hence, I should counteroffer in a way that aims to increase my value from this negotiation above 97, without making an unreasonable offer in case Player 1 can further negotiate.\n\n4. **Counteroffer Proposal:**\n   - Considering available items: [1, 5, 3, 3, 4]\n   - Counterproposal: Let's divide the items to slightly favor me while still appearing fair.\n   - Offer to Player 1: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n   - That means I keep: [1, 5, 2, 2, 3]\n\n5. **Value of Counteroffer:**\n   - For me:\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n     - 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 9 = 45\n     - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n   - Total value = 5 + 45 + 12 + 14 + 15 = 91\n\nAlthough the value from my counter is still slightly lower after the discount, it rounds up my return slightly fairer due to negotiation dynamics. However, let's ensure that my value outweighs the first round decrease.\n\n6. **Action:**\n\nGiven the importance of securing value above the current round's worth and the dynamics after the discount factor in future potential rounds, I have to think a balance between proposing value and practicality. Let me slightly adjust it to match at least a pre-discount return.\n\nAfter careful thought, considering negotiation progress in fairness to structure a more practical final proposal if still at hand, the outcome choice of balancing in given circumstance substantial basis per initial dynamics:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n\nGiven the current value space dynamics after discount and respective standpoints, securing a sustained primary fallback base is strategically essential here.

I have to ensure that this offer maximizes my total value and is above my outside offer value of 72. Here is my reasoning and calculation:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Value of All Items:**\n    - Item 1: 5 units \u00d7 7 value = 35\n    - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 10 value = 30\n    - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 7 value = 14\n    - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 5 value = 10\n    - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 2 value = 4\n    - **Total Value = 93**\n\n2. **Objective:**\n    - I want my total value after the offer to be larger than 72 since my outside offer is 72.\n\n3. **Determine an Offer:**\n    - I need to propose an offer that gives me a balance greater than 72.\n\n4. **Propose an Offer:**\n    - Let's consider offering Player 2 some units where I retain the highest value items for myself to maximize my value. I could offer them fewer units of high-value items and more of lower-value items.\n\n    **Offer Calculation:**\n    - Offer 2 units of Item 1: I keep 3 \u2192 My value: 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n    - Offer 0 units of Item 2: I keep 3 \u2192 My value: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n    - Offer 1 unit of Item 3: I keep 1 \u2192 My value: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n    - Offer 0 units of Item 4: I keep 2 \u2192 My value: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n    - Offer 2 units of Item 5: I keep 0 \u2192 My value: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n\n    **My Total Value = 21 + 30 + 7 + 10 + 0 = 68**\n\nThis does not meet my outside offer value of 72, so I will not propose this specific allocation. I need to adjust to ensure my value is at least 72.\n\n**New Offer Calculation:**\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 1: I keep 4 \u2192 My value: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n- Offer 0 units of Item 2: I keep 3 \u2192 My value: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 3: I keep 1 \u2192 My value: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 4: I keep 1 \u2192 My value: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n- Offer 2 units of Item 5: I keep 0 \u2192 My value: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n\n**New Total Value = 28 + 30 + 7 + 5 + 0 = 70**\n\nAgain, this is below my outside offer. Therefore, I will make another attempt:\n\n**Final Offer Calculation:**\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 1: I keep 4 \u2192 My value: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n- Offer 0 units of Item 2: I keep 3 \u2192 My value: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n- Offer 0 units of Item 3: I keep 2 \u2192 My value: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 4: I keep 1 \u2192 My value: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n- Offer 0 units of Item 5: I keep 2 \u2192 My value: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n\n**Final Total Value = 28 + 30 + 14 + 5 + 4 = 81**\n\nThis surpasses my outside offer value of 72.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 72. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 93 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a decision, I first need to evaluate the current offer and decide whether it provides me with a value that's greater than or at least comparable to my outside offer value of 72, considering the discount factor.\n\n1. **Evaluate the Current Offer:**\n   - I receive: \n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n   - Total value from accepting the current offer in round 2 (after applying the discount factor): \n     - Value without discount: 7 + 0 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 14\n     - Discounted value (gamma = 0.9, r = 2): \n       - 14 \u00d7 0.9^(2-1) = 14 \u00d7 0.9 = 12.6\n\n2. **Compare with Outside Offer:**\n   - My outside offer value is 72, which is significantly higher than the discounted value of the current tabled offer (12.6).\n\n3. **Consider Making a Counteroffer:**\n   - My goal is to ensure I receive a value greater than 72 after accounting for the discount.\n   - I'll try to maximize my value while making a fair offer to Player 2. Let's consider offering them fewer high-value items to secure more value for myself.\n\n   **Propose a Counteroffer such as [3, 1, 0, 1, 1]:**\n   - I keep: \n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n   - Total value for the items I keep: 14 + 20 + 14 + 5 + 2 = 55\n   - After applying the discount, the total value becomes: \n     - 55 \u00d7 0.9 = 49.5 \n\nThe value of 49.5 (considering the discount), still doesn't surpass the outside offer of 72. Given the constraints and time left, it is advantageous to move towards a deal structure rather than losing items of value considering the alternative is unsatisfactory.\n\n4. **Decision:**\n   Given that neither the current proposal nor a counteroffer offers sufficient value considering the outside offer, it is best to choose WALK to secure the higher guaranteed private outside offer value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "To determine the best initial offer, let's examine the total value of all items and then assess possible offers.\n\nFirst, let's calculate your total potential value from keeping all items:\n\n- Item 1: 5 units \u00d7 1 value = 5\n- Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 6 value = 18\n- Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 3 value = 12\n- Item 4: 8 units \u00d7 1 value = 8\n- Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 9 value = 18\n\nTotal value of all items = 5 + 18 + 12 + 8 + 18 = 61\n\nYour outside offer is 48, which means any offer you make should aim for a value at least equal to 48 to consider offering it over taking the outside option. Note that you must account for potential future discounting. Initially choosing a strong position could lead to higher value retention over negotiation rounds.\n\nThe strategy is to offer fewer high-value items and more of the lower-value items to Player 2. Let\u2019s construct an offer that provides a balance between maintaining a relatively high present value and leaving room for negotiation:\n\n**Propose an offer:**\n- Offer 4 units of Item 1 to Player 2 (keeping 1): 1 unit \u00d7 1 = 1\n- Offer 2 units of Item 2 to Player 2 (keeping 1): 1 unit \u00d7 6 = 6\n- Offer 2 units of Item 3 to Player 2 (keeping 2): 2 units \u00d7 3 = 6\n- Offer 6 units of Item 4 to Player 2 (keeping 2): 2 units \u00d7 1 = 2\n- Offer 0 units of Item 5 to Player 2 (keeping 2): 2 units \u00d7 9 = 18\n\nBy calculating the value of items I\u2019d be left with:\n- 1 + 6 + 6 + 2 + 18 = 33\n\nThis is less than my outside offer value of 48. Therefore, I should offer a bit more to Player 2 to potentially reach a value of at least 48.\n\nAdjust the offer:\n- Keep the initial plan but offer 1 Item 2 keeping none, because my alternative value will still allow me to make minor adjustments.\n\n- 0 units of Item 1 = 0\n- 1 units of Item 2 = 6\n- 2 units of Item 3 = 6\n- 2 units of Item 4 = 2\n- 2 units of Item 5 = 18\n\n**New Calculation:**\n- 0 + 6 + 6 + 2 + 18 = 32\n\nThis seems underestimated in approach. We need to iterate our offering to a balance reaching close to or above 48:\n\nHere\u2019s another quick attempt:\n- Offer as follows:\n- Offer 2 units of Item 1 \n- Offer 2 units of Item 2 (keeping 1): 1 unit \u00d7 6 = 6\n- Offer 2 units of Item 3 \n- Offer 4 units of Item 4 (keeping 4): 4 units \u00d7 1 =4\n- Offer 1 units of Item 5 (keeping 1): 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\n\nThis gives a retention value of: \n- 3 + 6 + 6 + 4 + 9 = 28, still not ideal.\n\nHence, making a true balance based on early calculations can be optimized:\n\nI propose offering:\n- 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nRetain value computes to approximately: \n- 12 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 9 = 30\n\nLet\u2019s confirm optimal calculation potential given starting valuations. The exceeding of minimal thresholds while acknowledging room for negotiation:\n\nOptimize this to:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 3, 1]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 92. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 75 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make the best decision in this negotiation, I need to first evaluate my outside offer and compare it to the potential counteroffers I can make. My outside offer value is 92, and my total value for all available items is 102. I aim to create a counteroffer that gives me a value as close to 102 as possible, but at least higher than 92, accounting for the discount factor if the negotiation continues into later rounds.\n\nLet's calculate the total value I would get if I made various offers to Player 2.\n\n1. **My item valuations:**\n   - Item 1: 2\n   - Item 2: 4\n   - Item 3: 8\n   - Item 4: 5\n   - Item 5: 6\n\n2. **Total units available:** \n   - 7 units of item 1\n   - 6 units of item 2\n   - 2 units of item 3\n   - 6 units of item 4\n   - 3 units of item 5\n\n3. **Objective:** \n   - Secure a value greater than 92 for myself.\n\nTo start, I might keep more units of the higher-value items (items 3 and 5) because they contribute more to my total value. Let's make a counteroffer that gives Player 2 one of each type, except the high-value items where I offer less.\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer:**\n- Offer Player 2: \n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n\n**My Remaining Units and Their Values:**\n- Remaining 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n- Remaining 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n- Remaining 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n- Remaining 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n- Remaining 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n\n**Total Value to Me:** \n- Total = 6 + 12 + 8 + 15 + 12 = 53\n\nClearly, the total value of 53 is below my outside offer of 92, so this counteroffer isn't favorable. Let's try an alternative distribution to keep more of the highest-value items, which are 3 and 5.\n\n**Revised Counteroffer:**\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 0 units of item 5\n\n**My Remaining Units and Their Values:**\n- Remaining 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n- Remaining 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n- Remaining 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n- Remaining 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n- Remaining 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n\n**Total Value to Me:**\n- Total = 4 + 8 + 16 + 10 + 18 = 56\n\nThe revised total value is still below the outside offer, indicating the necessity for significant adjustments in allocation to favor more retention of value-heavy items.\n\n**Offer less Item 2 and more Item 5:**\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 5 units of item 4\n  - 0 units of item 5\n\n**My Remaining Units and Their Values:**\n- Remaining 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n- Remaining 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n- Remaining 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n- Remaining 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n- Remaining 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n\n**Total Value to Me:**\n- Total = 4 + 12 + 16 + 5 + 18 = 55\n\nUltimately, I need to find an agreeable distribution providing at least my outside offer value. Instead, the plausible next step is to engineer simplified negotiations valuing item retention more straightforwardly or opt for withdrawal should initial rounds prove similarly restrained in outcome advantage.\n\nHence, after failed attempts for favorable distribution achieving satisfiable earmarking of resources according to value need/order, my action is to choose safeguarding ensured value via:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

However, I want to maintain a margin above 17 after applying future discounts.\n\n5. **Initial Offer Strategy**:\n    - Offer Player 2 a portion of the items that still allows me to retain significant value:\n    - I will propose:\n      - Offer Player 2: [0, 3, 2, 2, 1]\n      - Calculate: \n        - I keep for myself: \n          - Item 1: 1 unit -> value = 2\n          - Item 2: 4 units -> value = 40\n          - Item 3: 2 units -> value = 12\n          - Item 4: 2 units -> value = 16\n          - Item 5: 2 units -> value = 6\n        - Total value I get by this offer: 2 + 40 + 12 + 16 + 6 = 76\n\n6. **Decision**:\n    - With this distribution, I maintain a value of 76, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 17. \n\nTherefore, I propose the following initial offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 87. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 66 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Thus, I should revisit my distribution:\n\n### Revised Offer\nMaximize items with high value:\n\n**Let\u2019s try offering:** `[0, 1, 0, 2, 5]`\n- Meaning, I keep [3, 3, 4, 1, 2]\n\nCalculating my value:\n- Item 1: Keeps 3, value = \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\)\n- Item 2: Keeps 3, value = \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\)\n- Item 3: Keeps 4, value = \\(4 \\times 8 = 32\\)\n- Item 4: Keeps 1, value = \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\)\n- Item 5: Keeps 2, value = \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\)\n\n**Total value = 21 + 18 + 32 + 3 + 8 = 82** (Still less than 83)\n\n### Conclusion\nI must counter with a distribution that presents the potential of meeting or exceeding 83, keeping the round and discounting in mind. Given this attempt doesn't exceed, retuning items is necessary or attempt asymmetrical max fortunes of others over duality.\n\nIf an acceptable suggestion is to walk away, but presenting:\n- **Strategized initiating:** `[0, 0, 0, 2, 5]`\n\n- Meaning: Keep [3, 4, 4, 1, 2]\n\nCalculating value:\n- Item 1: 21 + Item 2: 24 + Item 3: 32 + Item 4: 3 + Item 5: 8 = **88**\n\nPresent to maximizing above the Private outside option, counteroffer verification:\n\n**Therefore, I'll offer this as a COUNTEROFFER:**\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 2, 5]}",

Let's try to adjust it closer to the outside offer.\n\n### Adjust second counteroffer:\n- Offer Player 2 = [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nI would keep:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 5 units of item 5\n\nCalculate the value:\n- Item 1: 2 * 7 = 14\n- Item 2: 3 * 6 = 18\n- Item 3: 3 * 8 = 24\n- Item 4: 3 * 3 = 9\n- Item 5: 5 * 4 = 20\n\nTotal value = 14 + 18 + 24 + 9 + 20 = 85\n\nDiscounted value = 85 * 0.9 = 76.5\n\nThis counteroffer still doesn't surpass the outside offer post-discount, suggesting that Player 2 might have a high counter willingness.\n\nGiven these options and calculations, the best move is:\n- WALK, because I cannot secure a deal offering better than my outside offer at the current point, given expected game dynamics.\n\nFinal action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I need to determine an initial offer that maximizes my value, keeping in mind that I will need to achieve a value higher than or close to my outside offer of 74. Here is the reasoning:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Value of All Items to Me:**\n\n   - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 8 = 8\n   - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 8 = 32\n   - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 8 = 24\n   - Item 4: 5 units \u00d7 1 = 5\n   - Item 5: 6 units \u00d7 3 = 18\n   - Total Value = 8 + 32 + 24 + 5 + 18 = 87\n\n2. **Compare Total Value with Outside Offer:**\n\n   - My outside offer is 74.\n   - The total value of all items to me is 87, which is higher than my outside offer. Thus, my goal is to secure a deal where I receive at least a value close to or above 74.\n\n3. **Develop Initial Offer:**\n\n   I aim to maximize my value while leaving enough value for Player 2 to potentially accept the deal. I need to propose a split such that my value from the items I keep exceeds 74 after considering the discount factor in later rounds, if necessary.\n\n   - If I keep most of the high-value items (items 1, 2, and 3) and offer a fair split on lower-value items (items 4 and 5), I can potentially maximize my value from the negotiation.\n\n4. **Calculate an Example Offer:**\n\n   Let's try offering what might be acceptable:\n   - Offer Player 2 all of item 5 (6 units) and item 4 (3 units):\n     - I keep: Item 1 (1 unit), Item 2 (4 units), Item 3 (3 units), Item 4 (2 units for myself), Item 5 (0 units for myself)\n     - Player 2 gets: Item 5 (6 units), Item 4 (3 units)\n\n5. **Value Calculation for My Kept Items:**\n\n   - Value for me:\n     - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n     - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n     - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n     - Total Value = 8 + 32 + 24 + 2 + 0 = 66\n\nImmediate value does not exceed 74, but considering two rounds with gamma = 0.9, I might wait to see counteroffers. I need a higher initial value, so more units of item 4 should be given to myself.\n\nRe-evaluating:\nOffer more item 2 (2 units instead of 4) to Player 2: \n- My new item values:\n  - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16  (kept units reduce but compensating by keeping item 4 fully)\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n  - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 1 = 5\n  - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n  - Total Value = 8 + 16 + 24 + 5 + 0 = 53 (which doesn't exceed either, indicating the need for better initial structure)\n\nIdeal offering adjustment optimizes:\n\n- Give Player 2 distribution slightly more favorable but makes guaranteed 58 value later viable after discount round(at discounted rate 0.9 for subsequent):\n\n  Offer on round 1 proposal:\n  - Offer: [0, 3, 2, 3, 6]  (i.e., keep more for analysis through counter rounds)\n  - Value from Item 2 & 3 mainly fewer: total remains about 68.\n\nTry buffering slightly for favor alignment, in expectation of middle-round optimization. \n\nHence, I propose counterpart distribution of all items to examine viability and receive counter-refinement.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 2, 3, 6]}\n```",

Given the discount factor, aiming for a slightly higher value in this round can be beneficial as future rounds will reduce the value through the discount.\n\nCurrent items available:\n- Item 1: 2 units total\n- Item 2: 4 units total\n- Item 3: 2 units total\n- Item 4: 2 units total\n- Item 5: 1 unit total\n\nI should propose a counteroffer that keeps the total units respecting the available quantities.\n\n**Counteroffer planning:**\n- Keep 1 unit of item 1\n- Keep 3 units of item 2\n- Keep 1 unit of item 3\n- Keep 1 unit of item 4\n- Keep 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis leaves the other player with [1, 1, 1, 1, 0].\n\nLet's calculate the value for me if I propose this:\n\n- Value of 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n- Value of 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n- Value of 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- Value of 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n- Value of 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n\nTotal value I retain = 5 + 27 + 9 + 10 + 5 = 56\n\nThis value is still slightly below my outside offer of 58.\n\nBy retaining more items or adjusting, I should aim for a minimum value of my outside offer considering it's the first round. \n\nFurther adjustment:\n- Keep 4 units of item 2 instead, leaving [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] for the other player.\n\nRecalculate:\n- Value of 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n- Value of 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n- Value of 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- Value of 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n- Value of 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n\nTotal value = 5 + 36 + 9 + 10 + 0 = 60\n\nThis gives me a total value of 60, which is better than my outside offer. I will go with this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

I should aim for an offer that gives me a value significantly greater than 98 after considering the discounting factor over the rounds. To determine a reasonable offer, I'll explore different allocations that maximize my value above 98.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2 one possible split:\n\n- Offer: [0, 4, 1, 5, 2] (my offer to Player 2)\n- This means:\n  - I keep 2 units of item 1 (value 20)\n  - I keep 1 unit of item 2 (value 1)\n  - I keep 1 unit of item 3 (value 3)\n  - I keep 3 units of item 4 (value 21)\n  - I keep 3 units of item 5 (value 30)\n\nTotal value I receive = 20 + 1 + 3 + 21 + 30 = 75\n\nSince 75 is less than 98, this allocation does not meet my outside offer value. Therefore, I need to adjust the split to increase my retained value closer to or greater than 98.\n\nLet's adjust:\n\nOffer: [0, 3, 1, 4, 2]\n\n- I keep 2 units of item 1 (value 20)\n- I keep 2 units of item 2 (value 2)\n- I keep 1 unit of item 3 (value 3)\n- I keep 4 units of item 4 (value 28)\n- I keep 3 units of item 5 (value 30)\n\nTotal value I receive = 20 + 2 + 3 + 28 + 30 = 83\n\n83 is still less than 98 after considering potential discounting.

Therefore, accepting this offer is not a good option. \n\nNext, I will consider making a counteroffer that maximizes my value while still being reasonable. Since I'm in round 2, I want to ensure that my value after the discount is greater than my outside offer of 98.\n\nTo maximize my value, I'll prioritize items I value most (item 1 and item 5) and try to get a satisfactory amount of item 4.\n\nConsider this potential counteroffer where I keep more valuable items:\nLet's offer Player 2: [0, 3, 0, 2, 2]\n\nThis counteroffer means:\n- I receive 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n- I receive 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n- I receive 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n- I receive 6 units of item 4: 6 \u00d7 7 = 42\n- I receive 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n- Total value = 100\n\nDiscount this to round 2 with the gamma factor, total value = 100 \u00d7 0.9 = 90\n\nEven though this value is still below my outside option, it has a higher potential value. It\u2019s unlikely to satisfy my need for a better value now, given discounts in round 3, but strategically it's good to engage Player 2 more. \n\nHowever, wanting a realistic chance to achieve just over 98, a more optimal balance may involve negotiating for more item 4 since it's valued at 7 per unit.\n\nBut strategically, since any deal in the next round (if this is not accepted) will receive an additional discount, deriving less than the best outcome from negotiation is quite likely, which leads me, evaluating options:\n\nI'll WALK to optimize my outcome given current valuations.

Here's the step-by-step rationale:\n\n1. **Evaluate My Private Values for Each Item Type:**\n   - Item 1: Value of 1 per unit\n   - Item 2: Value of 10 per unit\n   - Item 3: Value of 8 per unit\n   - Item 4: Value of 2 per unit\n   - Item 5: Value of 1 per unit\n\n2. **Calculate Total Possible Value (Ignoring Discounts):**\n   - Max possible value = (4 * 1) + (5 * 10) + (4 * 8) + (4 * 2) + (1 * 1)\n   - Max possible value = 4 + 50 + 32 + 8 + 1 = 95\n\n3. **Outside Offer Value:**\n   - My guaranteed value if I walk away = 60\n\n4. **Create an Initial Offer:**\n   - The goal is to keep the items with the highest values to me and offer items of lower value to Player 2.\n   - Aim to achieve a total value greater than the outside offer (60) after discount but also satisfactory to Player 2.\n\n5. **Develop an Offer That Balances My Gain With Likely Acceptance by Player 2:**\n   - A fair initial distribution that gives Player 2 some valuable items but keeps me above the outside offer:\n\n   - Offer Player 2:\n     - Item 1: 3 units (offering the majority of a low-value item to me)\n     - Item 2: 2 units (offering enough to show good faith but keeping more due to high personal value)\n     - Item 3: 1 unit (offering a smaller amount of a moderately high-value item)\n     - Item 4: 2 units (offering half of a low-value item to me)\n     - Item 5: 0 units (keeping the only unit of a low-value item to myself)\n\n6. **Calculate My Value for This Offer:**\n   - My units and values:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n   - Total value = 60\n\nGiven the discount rate doesn't apply yet (first round), my total offer value is exactly 60. This matches my outside offer value, so it seems fair enough but needs adjustment on acceptance likelihood.\n\nTherefore, here's my strategy suggestion:\n- Provide a marginal increase in some lower-valued items like item 4 or item 5 to secure likelihood acceptance from player 2, boosting their perception of fairness.\n\nRevised Offer to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 0\n\nCompute my adjusted retained value: \n- Value to me = (1x1) + (3x10) + (3x8) + (1x2) + (1x1) = 1 + 30 + 24 + 2 + 1 = 58\n- Slightly under but employs tactics assuming negotiation favor perceived fairness in early rounds.\n\nCounteroffer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 1, 3, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "To determine my action, I need to make an initial offer that maximizes my value above my outside offer value of 90.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of each item and calculate the maximum value I can obtain from each item type:\n\n- Item 1: 4 units, value per unit = 9, total value = 4 * 9 = 36\n- Item 2: 3 units, value per unit = 3, total value = 3 * 3 = 9\n- Item 3: 6 units, value per unit = 5, total value = 6 * 5 = 30\n- Item 4: 1 unit, value per unit = 4, total value = 1 * 4 = 4\n- Item 5: 6 units, value per unit = 7, total value = 6 * 7 = 42\n\nThe sum of all item values for me is 121, which confirms with my private total value. My outside offer is 90, so I\u2019m aiming for more than that in my offer to maximize value.\n\nTo have a value higher than my outside offer, let's make an offer that retains more valuable items for myself. Since items 1 and 5 have higher values per unit, I want to keep them as much as possible.\n\n### Offer Strategy:\n1. Offer less of items with high personal value (item 1 and item 5).\n2. Consider offering more of less valuable items (item 2, item 3, and item 4).\n\nHere's a proposed offer to Player 2:\n\n- Offer 1 unit of item 1 to Player 2.\n- Offer 2 units of item 2 to Player 2.\n- Offer 3 units of item 3 to Player 2.\n- Offer 0 units of item 4 to Player 2 (keeping it for myself).\n- Offer 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2.\n\n#### Calculating the value of this offer:\n\n- I keep: 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 9 = 27\n- I keep: 1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 3 = 3\n- I keep: 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 5 = 15\n- I keep: 1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 4 = 4\n- I keep: 5 units of item 5 = 5 * 7 = 35\n\nTotal value with this offer: 27 + 3 + 15 + 4 + 35 = 84\n\nHowever, my offer must be better than my outside option, and this isn't sufficient.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, I need to make a counteroffer such that I can keep the maximum value of 71 or close to it, while leaving enough for Player 2 to be willing to accept.\n\n### Initial Counteroffer Proposal:\n1. Item 2: Offer 3 units to Player 2 (keeping 1 unit for myself)\n2. Item 3: Offer 1 unit to Player 2 (keeping 1 unit for myself)\n3. Item 4: Offer 1 unit to Player 2 (keeping 1 unit for myself)\n4. Item 5: Offer 2 units to Player 2 (keeping 1 unit for myself)\n\nLet's calculate the value to me if Player 2 accepts:\n- 1 unit of Item 2: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n- 1 unit of Item 3: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n- 1 unit of Item 4: 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- Total Value to Me = 3 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 28\n\nGiven that this value of 28 is way lower than my outside offer of 70, and considering Player 2's values are unknown, I will adjust to more items for myself:\n\n### Adjusted Counteroffer:\n1. Item 2: Offer 2 units to Player 2 (keeping 2 units for myself)\n2. Item 3: Offer 0 units to Player 2 (keeping 2 units for myself)\n3. Item 4: Offer 1 unit to Player 2 (keeping 1 unit for myself)\n4. Item 5: Offer 1 unit to Player 2 (keeping 2 units for myself)\n\nValue to me if this counteroffer is accepted:\n- 2 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n- 2 units of Item 3: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n- 1 unit of Item 4: 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- 2 units of Item 5: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n- Total Value to Me = 6 + 14 + 9 + 18 = 47\n\nGiven that none of these offer me a total value anywhere close to my outside option value of 70, it may not be acceptable unless the other party's outside offer is significantly lower, which would encourage them to accept.\n\nThus, to aim for maximizing my value, I will propose a counteroffer that balances the division while keeping my position stronger compared to walking:\n\n### Final Attempt for a Valid Offer:\n\nTo reach closer to my maximum possible internal value, I might choose this:\n1. Item 2: Offer 1 unit to Player 2 (keeping 3 units for me)\n2. Item 3: Offer 0 units to Player 2 (keeping 2 units for me)\n3. Item 4: Offer 1 unit to Player 2 (keeping 1 unit for me)\n4. Item 5: Offer 0 units to Player 2 (keeping 3 units for me)\n\nChecking the value with this configuration:\n- 3 units of Item 2: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n- 2 units of Item 3: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n- 1 unit of Item 4: 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- 3 units of Item 5: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n- Total Value to Me = 9 + 14 + 9 + 27 = 59\n\nUnfortunately, it seems I cannot form an offer structure where the optimal division provides me at least 70 in value during the first round. Given the discount factor would further reduce potential value in proceeding rounds, obtaining at least 70 isn't feasible in this suggested division either.\n\nThus, given the constraint posed by my very high outside offer, and the fact that there are no combinations giving me a minimum of 70 value under the constraints of the negotiation setup, I am not positioned to submit a counteroffer beneficially.\n\n**Conclusion: WALK**\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "To evaluate the current offer and decide on an action, let's first calculate the value of the offer to me, as Player 2.\n\n### Current Offer Evaluation\n\nThe current offer gives me the following items:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 5 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\n#### Calculate Value of Each Item\n- Value of item 1: 0 units \u00d7 9 = 0\n- Value of item 2: 5 units \u00d7 6 = 30\n- Value of item 3: 2 units \u00d7 2 = 4\n- Value of item 4: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20\n- Value of item 5: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n\nTotal Value = 0 + 30 + 4 + 20 + 8 = 62\n\n### Comparison with Outside Offer\n- My outside offer value is 85. \n- The current offer's value (62) is less than my outside offer. Thus, accepting it does not make sense.\n\n### Counteroffer Consideration\nI should consider a counteroffer that could exceed the value of my outside offer, which is 85, without giving too much value away early in the negotiation.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffer\nIf I propose an offer that gives Player 1 less valuable items, I can increase my value:\n\n- Offer of [3, 3, 1, 0, 1] gives me:\n  - My items: [1, 5, 1, 2, 1]\n  \n  Calculate Value:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\n  - Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 6 = 30\n  - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 2 = 2\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20\n  - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 4 = 4\n\nTotal Value = 9 + 30 + 2 + 20 + 4 = 65\n\nWhile this is not yet equal to my outside offer value, it retains more high-value items and leaves room for future negotiation. However, it must be greater than my counter so I need to adjust:\n\nMy target value to exceed outside offer: I must retain higher value items: [2, 3, 0, 2, 1] gives:\n  - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 9 = 18\n  - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 6 = 18\n  - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 2 = 0\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20\n  - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 4 = 4\n\nTotal Value = 18 + 18 + 0 + 20 + 4 = 60  \nThis is not above 85, and using the discount factor, still won't outperform my outside offer standard,\n\nAll these attempts are yielding less than my outside offer value when considering the discounted rounds.\n\nGiven these insights, the most strategic decision in this round is to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Here is my approach:\n\n1. **Evaluate my current valuation for all items**:\n   - Total units available for each item are: \n     - Item 1: 2 units, value per unit = 1\n     - Item 2: 4 units, value per unit = 8\n     - Item 3: 5 units, value per unit = 6\n     - Item 4: 5 units, value per unit = 5\n     - Item 5: 3 units, value per unit = 3\n\n2. **Calculate the total value of all items**:\n   - Item 1: 2 units * 1 = 2\n   - Item 2: 4 units * 8 = 32\n   - Item 3: 5 units * 6 = 30\n   - Item 4: 5 units * 5 = 25\n   - Item 5: 3 units * 3 = 9\n   - Total value = 2 + 32 + 30 + 25 + 9 = 98\n\n3. **Offer Calculation**:\n   - I aim to keep a value for myself that is greater than 9, my outside offer.\n\n   **Example Offer Calculation:**\n   - Offer Player 2: [1, 2, 3, 2, 2] \n     - I keep: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n     - My received items value:\n       - Item 1: 1 * 1 = 1\n       - Item 2: 2 * 8 = 16\n       - Item 3: 2 * 6 = 12\n       - Item 4: 3 * 5 = 15\n       - Item 5: 1 * 3 = 3\n     - Total value = 1 + 16 + 12 + 15 + 3 = 47\n\n   The total value of 47 is much higher than my outside option of 9, so this is a good starting point for negotiation.

                    "response": "To decide on my action, I need to evaluate the current offer and compare its value to my outside offer value of 47. The current offer is [2, 1, 2, 2, 2], meaning I receive 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nLet's calculate the value of this offer:\n\n1. For item 1, my value per unit is 1:  \n   Value = 2 units \u00d7 1 value/unit = 2\n\n2. For item 2, my value per unit is 8:  \n   Value = 1 unit \u00d7 8 value/unit = 8\n\n3. For item 3, my value per unit is 2:  \n   Value = 2 units \u00d7 2 value/unit = 4\n\n4. For item 4, my value per unit is 2:  \n   Value = 2 units \u00d7 2 value/unit = 4\n\n5. For item 5, my value per unit is 5:  \n   Value = 2 units \u00d7 5 value/unit = 10\n\nAdding these up gives a total value:  \nTotal value = 2 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 28\n\nThis value of 28 is well below my outside offer of 47. Therefore, accepting this offer is not advantageous. I will make a counteroffer that aims to maximize my value while still being reasonable enough for Player 1 to consider.\n\nGiven my objective is to exceed a value of 47, let's create a counteroffer.\n\nA possible counteroffer could be [3, 0, 4, 2, 2], meaning I give Player 1:\n- 3 units of item 1 (value to me: 4 units \u00d7 1 = 4 remaining)\n- 0 units of item 2 (value to me: 2 units \u00d7 8 = 16 remaining)\n- 4 units of item 3 (value to me: 3 units \u00d7 2 = 6 remaining)\n- 2 units of item 4 (value to me: 2 units \u00d7 2 = 4 remaining)\n- 2 units of item 5 (value to me: 3 units \u00d7 5 = 15 remaining)\n\nCalculating my value:\n\n1. Item 1: 4 units left \u00d7 1 = 4\n2. Item 2: 2 units left \u00d7 8 = 16\n3. Item 3: 3 units left \u00d7 2 = 6\n4. Item 4: 2 units left \u00d7 2 = 4\n5. Item 5: 3 units left \u00d7 5 = 15\n\nTotal value I will receive: 4 + 16 + 6 + 4 + 15 = 45\n\nSince this is close but still less than my outside offer of 47, let's try a different allocation:\n\nCounteroffer: [3, 0, 4, 1, 2]\n\nRecalculating with this, gives me:\n\n1. Item 1: 4 units left \u00d7 1 = 4\n2. Item 2: 2 units left \u00d7 8 = 16\n3. Item 3: 3 units left \u00d7 2 = 6\n4. Item 4: 3 units left \u00d7 2 = 6\n5. Item 5: 3 units left \u00d7 5 = 15\n\nTotal value I will receive: 4 + 16 + 6 + 6 + 15 = 47\n\nThis exactly matches my outside offer. Given the preference for negotiation value over the outside offer, this is the best valid counter I can offer. \n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 4, 1, 2]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To maximize my outcome from this negotiation, I need to carefully consider the values I assign to each item and compare them against my outside offer of 68. Here\u2019s the breakdown of my values for each item:\n\n- Item 1: 10 per unit\n- Item 2: 6 per unit\n- Item 3: 5 per unit\n- Item 4: 1 per unit\n- Item 5: 3 per unit\n\nWith the quantities available, the total possible value from all items is:\n\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n- 6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 5 = 30\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nTotal maximum value = 87\n\nGiven my outside offer is 68, any counteroffer I consider should result in a net present value higher than 68 to be preferable. My goal is to offer the least valuable items while retaining enough value to surpass 68.\n\nLet's make an initial offer designed to maximize my retained value:\n\nOffer breakdown, with retained values:\n\n- Offer Player 2: 0 of item 1 (retain all 3 for 30 points)\n- Offer Player 2: 0 of item 2 (retain all 2 for 12 points)\n- Offer Player 2: 4 of item 3 (retain 2 for 10 points)\n- Offer Player 2: 3 of item 4 (retain 0 for 0 points)\n- Offer Player 2: 3 of item 5 (retain 1 for 3 points)\n\nCalculating retained values:\n\n- Retained value of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n- Retained value of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n- Retained value of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n- Retained value of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n- Retained value of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\nTotal retained value = 30 + 12 + 10 + 0 + 3 = 55\n\nThe retained value (55) after offering some items to Player 2 is less than my outside offer (68). Let's adjust the offer so that my total is maximized above the outside offer, potentially by retaining more high-value items.\n\nProposing a different initial counteroffer:\n\n- Offer Player 2: 1 of item 1 (retain 2 for 20 points)\n- Offer Player 2: 1 of item 2 (retain 1 for 6 points)\n- Offer Player 2: 4 of item 3 (retain 2 for 10 points)\n- Offer Player 2: 3 of item 4 (retain 0 for 0 points)\n- Offer Player 2: 4 of item 5 (retain 0 for 0 points)\n\nTotal retained value:\n\n- Retained value of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n- Retained value of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n- Retained value of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n- Retained value of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n- Retained value of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n\nNew total retained value = 20 + 6 + 10 + 0 + 0 = 36, still below my outside offer. Let's adjust again.\n\nOne more attempt at offer optimization:\n\n- Offer Player 2: 0 of item 1 (retain 3 for 30 points)\n- Offer Player 2: 0 of item 2 (retain 2 for 12 points)\n- Offer Player 2: 5 of item 3 (retain 1 for 5 points)\n- Offer Player 2: 2 of item 4 (retain 1 for 1 point)\n- Offer Player 2: 4 of item 5 (retain 0 for 0 points)\n\nCalculating retained values:\n\n- Retained value of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n- Retained value of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n- Retained value of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n- Retained value of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- Retained value of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n\nTotal retained value after this offer: 30 + 12 + 5 + 1 + 0 = 48\n\nUpon re-evaluating and re-calculating my possible strategies with the constraints I face, retaining maximal value has proven complex. Thus, I will make a final refined offer:\n\n- Offer Player 2: 1 of item 1 (retain 2 for 20 points)\n- Offer Player 2: 0 of item 2 (retain 2 for 12 points)\n- Offer Player 2: 5 of item 3 (retain 1 for 5 points)\n- Offer Player 2: 3 of item 4 (retain 0 for 0 points)\n- Offer Player 2: 2 of item 5 (retain 2 for 6 points)\n\nRetained value:\n\n- Retained value of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n- Retained value of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n- Retained value of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n- Retained value of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n- Retained value of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n\nTotal retained value: 20 + 12 + 5 + 0 + 6 = 43, not achieving my preferred value. So, I continue adjusting based on possible optimal retention patterns.\n\nI settle on:\n\n- Offering Player 2: same balances as above upgrades\n\nFinal optimal counteroffer decision lead:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 5, 3, 2]}",

Therefore, the present value of this offer will be:\nPresent value = 82 \u00d7 0.9 = 73.8\n\nThe present value is lower than my outside offer (73.8 < 79). Thus, the current offer is not better than my outside offer.\n\n### Consider a Counteroffer\nTo make an effective counteroffer, I should aim for a value greater than 79 when adjusted for the discount. \n\nLet's create a counteroffer to see if it can exceed this value with the given constraint:\n\nConsider offering: [3, 3, 1, 2, 2]\n- I will receive 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n- Item 1: 6 units \u00d7 7 value/unit = 42\n- Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 10 value/unit = 20\n- Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 7 value/unit = 7\n- Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 1 value/unit = 1\n- Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 1 value/unit = 2\n\nTotal value to me = 42 + 20 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 72\n\nNow applying the discount for round 2:\nPresent value = 72 \u00d7 0.9 = 64.8\n\n72 is less than the value needed (higher than 79 when adjusted), therefore, I will aim for a counteroffer providing total value of 134 since its after gamma.\n\nLet's try offering: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\nI calculate my value with this counteroffer:\n- I will receive 8 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n- Item 1: 8 units \u00d7 7 value/unit = 56\n- Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 10 value/unit = 40\n- Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 7 value/unit = 7\n- Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 1 value/unit = 1\n- Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 1 value/unit = 2\n\nTotal value = 56 + 40 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 106\nDiscounted value = 106 * 0.9 = 95.4\n\nSince 95.4 is greater than my outside value of 79 this is a promising offer possibility.\n\n**Decision**: \nI'll make the counteroffer since it exceeds the outside offer when adjusted by gamma:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 107. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 111 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I will make a counteroffer that ensures a higher value on my end while reasonably considering what Player 1 might accept.\n\nMy goal is to get at least a deal valued more than my outside offer adjusted by future negotiations, considering round 2's discount factor, which is 0.9.\n\n### Calculate A Counteroffer\n\nI need a counteroffer where my value exceeds this reduced payoff of my outside offer expected value in terms of round adjustment. Aiming for at least 120 value in overall potential throughout rounds can guide the counteroffer:\n\nLet's propose giving:\n- 1 unit of item 1 to Player 1 (I value it highly)\n- 0 unit of item 2 (I value it low)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (balance here)\n- 0 unit of item 4 (value it highly)\n- 0 unit of item 5 (make sure they get some of lower here)\n\n**Calculation for My Retained Value:**\n- Items I get = [4, 3, 5, 2, 7] - [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] = [4, 3, 5, 2, 7]\n- Value for me = (4\u00d79) + (3\u00d72) + (5\u00d76) + (2\u00d78) + (7\u00d73) = 36 + 6 + 30 + 16 + 21 = 109\n\nConsidering factors (gamma^1 for round 2 = 0.9), I am well within achievable results upwards of 120 after preferences and still negotiating favorable retainment toward its potential given rounds.\n\nThus, my action should be:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}",

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Evaluate the current offer from Player 2:**  \n   The current offer is [1, 0, 1, 0, 0], meaning I receive 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value from item 1} = 1 \\times 5 = 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value from item 2} = 0 \\times 2 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value from item 3} = 1 \\times 10 = 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value from item 4} = 0 \\times 6 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value from item 5} = 0 \\times 7 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   Total value of the offer = 5 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 0 = 15\n\n2. **Compare this value to my outside offer:** \n   - My outside offer is worth 70.\n   - The value of the current offer (15) is significantly less than my outside offer value (70).\n\n3. **Since the current offer is not acceptable (below my outside offer value), consider a counteroffer:**\n   - Ensure the resulting offer has a value greater than 70 for me after accounting for the amount left.\n   - For illustrative purposes, let's consider a different allocation. I'll keep the most valuable items for myself.\n\n   For example:\n   - Offer Player 2 the following: [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n   - Let's calculate the value I retain:\n\n     Items I keep are: \n     - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 5 = 20\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n     - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n     - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 7 = 35\n\n     Total retained value = 20 + 4 + 50 + 6 + 35 = 115\n\n4. **Ensure the offer is reasonable and acceptable:**\n   - With this offer, my retained value is greater than my outside offer, ensuring a better deal.\n\nTherefore, based on these calculations, I will make a counteroffer to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

Thus, I should make a counteroffer or walk away.\n\nNow, I need to consider a counteroffer that maximizes my value without being unfair to Player 2.\n\n1. If I take my previous offer, [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and improve it slightly to ensure fairness and still exceed the outside offer:\n   - Offer Player 2: [1, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n   - This would mean I keep: \n     - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n     - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n\n   Total value to me = 27 + 14 + 8 + 1 + 20 = 70\n\n2. After applying gamma = 0.9, the offer's value:\n   \\[ 70 \\times 0.9 = 63 \\]\n\n63 is still below my outside offer. Therefore, offering this will likely not be acceptable unless it's achieving at least some significant increase in perceived fairness or agreement likelihood. Currently, my priorities should focus on gaining an outcome more favorable than my outside offer of 82.\n\nWith no feasible counteroffer perceived to likely meet my outcomes over my outside offer and ensuring calculations' correctness without further loss of negotiation steps, walking away is the better course of action.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "To maximize my value from the negotiation and compare it with my outside offer, I need to first determine the total value of all the items available. This helps me make a strategic initial offer.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the maximum total value of all items based on my private values:\n\n- Total value of item 1 = 4 units \u00d7 1 = 4\n- Total value of item 2 = 1 unit \u00d7 8 = 8\n- Total value of item 3 = 4 units \u00d7 4 = 16\n- Total value of item 4 = 6 units \u00d7 8 = 48\n- Total value of item 5 = 3 units \u00d7 7 = 21\n\nTotal value of all items = 4 + 8 + 16 + 48 + 21 = 97\n\nGiven my outside option is 75, I must ensure my counteroffer provides a value greater than this to myself.\n\nLet's consider what I can keep from the items that would yield a value higher than 75, ensuring the deal is better than the outside offer.\n\nSince the total value is 97, and my outside offer is 75, I need to secure at least a value of 76 or more from the items.\n\nIf I provide a counteroffer such that:\n\n- I give Player 2:\n  - 3 units of item 1 (value to me = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3)\n  - 0 units of item 2 (value to me = 0 \u00d7 8 = 0)\n  - 2 units of item 3 (value to me = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8)\n  - 3 units of item 4 (value to me = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24)\n  - 1 unit of item 5 (value to me = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7)\n\nThen, I keep:\n\n- 1 unit of item 1 (value = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (value = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8)\n- 2 units of item 3 (value = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8)\n- 3 units of item 4 (value = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24)\n- 2 units of item 5 (value = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14)\n\nTotal value to me from this offer = 1 + 8 + 8 + 24 + 14 = 55\n\nThis offer does not meet my outside offer value of 75. Therefore, I need to adjust the offer:\n\nLet's try altering the offer with more favorable terms:\n\nI give Player 2:\n- 4 units of item 1 (value to me = 4)\n- 0 units of item 2 (value to me = 0)\n- 0 units of item 3 (value to me = 0)\n- 0 units of item 4 (value to me = 0)\n- 0 units of item 5 (value to me = 0)\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- 0 unit of item 1 (value = 0)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (value = 8)\n- 4 units of item 3 (value = 16)\n- 6 units of item 4 (value = 48)\n- 3 units of item 5 (value = 21)\n\nTotal value = 8 + 16 + 48 + 21 = 93\n\nNow my offer gives me a value of 93, higher than my outside offer of 75.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 69. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 78 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 2, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 2, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Instead, I should propose a counteroffer that tries to get me a value as close to or greater than my outside offer of 77.\n\nAssuming Player 2's utility might align around similarly competitive offers, I consider a counteroffer that offers them a fewer number of high-weight items:\n\n- Let's try offering: [0, 1, 0, 0, 3]\n\n4. **Counteroffer evaluation**:\n   - I keep 2 units of item 1, worth \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n   - I keep 2 units of item 2, worth \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\)\n   - I keep 5 units of item 3, worth \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\)\n   - I keep 4 units of item 4, worth \\(4 \\times 8 = 32\\)\n   - I keep 3 units of item 5, worth \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\)\n   - Total value = \\(4 + 8 + 25 + 32 + 6 = 75\\)\n\nAfter adjusting for the discount rate: \\(75 \\times 0.9 = 67.5\\), which is still lower than my outside offer, but closer than if I would have accepted their offer.\n\nGiven these planning principles and value relations, strategically, I might reinforce leaving extra high-value items like item 4 to me instead of offering the entire 'higher end' of 3 units of item 5 to player 2, so I will alter the counter slightly to maintain value equilibrium.\n\nMaking a slightly tweaked counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 2, 5]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The current offer's value (55) is significantly lower than my outside offer value of 141. Even considering the fact that value is discounted in later rounds, this offer does not come close to my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer that better aligns with a value at least close to my outside offer. Let's calculate one possible counteroffer. I aim for a counteroffer where my value is high enough, close to 141 or more, if possible.\n\nLet's try offering:\n\n- **Item 1**: 0 units to Player 1 (keep all 7 for myself = 35)\n- **Item 2**: 0 units to Player 1 (keep 1 for myself = 10)\n- **Item 3**: 1 unit to Player 1 (keep 5 for myself = 45)\n- **Item 4**: 1 unit to Player 1 (keep 3 for myself = 27)\n- **Item 5**: 1 unit to Player 1 (keep 1 for myself = 4)\n\nTotal value calculated if I make this offer:\n\n- **Item 1**: 7 units \u00d7 5 = 35\n- **Item 2**: 1 unit \u00d7 10 = 10\n- **Item 3**: 5 units \u00d7 9 = 45\n- **Item 4**: 3 units \u00d7 9 = 27\n- **Item 5**: 1 unit \u00d7 4 = 4\n\nThe total value of my proposed distribution to myself is 121. While this is still less than 141, it is an improvement over the current offer. A small concession leaves room for future improvement via discounting.\n\nIt's possible to make a better counteroffer, but given that any offer must be realistic and close to the midpoint in negotiations to be acceptable to Player 1, I'll propose this adjustment at first.\n\nTherefore, my counteroffer will be:\n- 0 units of item 1 to Player 1\n- 0 units of item 2 to Player 1\n- 1 unit of item 3 to Player 1\n- 1 unit of item 4 to Player 1\n- 1 unit of item 5 to Player 1\n\nThis gives me control over the valuable items to increase my potential negotiation advantage while not straying too far from Player 1's original offer. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]}",

More favored to walk.\n\nGiven the calculations, the initial position doesn't quite reach 114, so I'll make it relatively fair to test negotiation avenues while keeping that I would consider walking in subsequent rounds, focusing on retaining high-value items.\n\n#### Final Adjustments (Initial Offer Proposal)\nWith a realization that full direct calculation wasn't optimal if not above 114, a final strategic adjusted proposal:\n\n- Offer all of lesser value, which was 6 units initially visible on retained calculations, more straightforward overt for convincing Player 2 to decline strongly.\n\n**Offer the following: [0, 6, 0, 4, 1]**\n\nThis keeps maximally advantageous positions more direct if values later exploit room for appreciations.

However, counteroffers might only need to slightly improve negotiation parameters and could lead Player 2 towards acceptance. Hence, trying one more time for a favorable allocation might still benefit. \n\nGiven these thoughts, I will decide to:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Due to the private nature of the values, achieving a higher value without cooperation seems unlikely. As a result, negotiating to retain more of the high-value items is necessary. \n\nFinal revised offer:\n- Item 1: 1 unit (I keep 3 units)\n- Item 2: 0 units (I keep 2 units)\n- Item 3: 2 units (I keep 3 units)\n- Item 4: 0 units (I keep 3 units)\n- Item 5: 0 units (I keep 3 units)\n\nRecalculate value to me:\n- Item 1: 3 units at 3 = 9\n- Item 2: 2 units at 1 = 2\n- Item 3: 3 units at 5 = 15\n- Item 4: 3 units at 9 = 27\n- Item 5: 3 units at 8 = 24\n\nTotal value to me = 9 + 2 + 15 + 27 + 24 = 77\n\nThe value is still below 83, but I have adjusted it to be much closer. I would need additional rounds to potentially place more favorable offers based on counteroffers received but for an opening offer this attempts a balanced give-and-take starting point.\n\nGiven this initial assessment, I will proceed with an opening offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, I'll evaluate my options based on maximizing my value compared to my outside offer value of 69.\n\nFirstly, I should sum up the total number of items available:\n- Item 1: 7 units\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 6 units\n- Item 4: 2 units\n- Item 5: 2 units\n\nMy private values per unit are:\n- Item 1: 7\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 1\n\nMy total possible value from all items is calculated as follows:\n- Value of all Item 1: 7 units \u00d7 7 = 49\n- Value of all Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 1 = 1\n- Value of all Item 3: 6 units \u00d7 3 = 18\n- Value of all Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 2 = 4\n- Value of all Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 1 = 2\n- Total value = 49 + 1 + 18 + 4 + 2 = 74\n\nMy outside offer is 69, so I need a deal that gives me at least 69 in value under the discounting rules.\n\nNext, I consider potential offers to Player 2 and evaluate my value after making such offers. Given my outside offer is 69, I'll aim for offers where my retained value is at least as good as 69.\n\nLet's offer Player 2:\n- 2 units of Item 1\n- 0 units of Item 2\n- 3 units of Item 3\n- 1 unit of Item 4\n- 1 unit of Item 5\n\nThis means I would keep:\n- 5 units of Item 1, my value: 5 \u00d7 7 = 35\n- 1 unit of Item 2, my value: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- 3 units of Item 3, my value: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n- 1 unit of Item 4, my value: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n- 1 unit of Item 5, my value: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n\nTotal retained value = 35 + 1 + 9 + 2 + 1 = 48\n\nHowever, this retained value of 48 is well below my outside offer of 69. So, I'll adjust the offer:\n\nNow try offering Player 2:\n- 1 unit of Item 1\n- 0 units of Item 2\n- 2 units of Item 3\n- 0 units of Item 4\n- 0 units of Item 5\n\nI would then keep:\n- 6 units of Item 1, my value: 6 \u00d7 7 = 42\n- 1 unit of Item 2, my value: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- 4 units of Item 3, my value: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n- 2 units of Item 4, my value: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n- 2 units of Item 5, my value: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n\nTotal retained value = 42 + 1 + 12 + 4 + 2 = 61\n\nAgain, this is still below my outside offer. \n\nLet's further adjust:\nOffer Player 2:\n- 0 units of Item 1\n- 0 units of Item 2\n- 1 unit of Item 3\n- 0 units of Item 4\n- 0 units of Item 5\n\nRetain:\n- 7 units of Item 1, my value: 7 \u00d7 7 = 49\n- 1 unit of Item 2, my value: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- 5 units of Item 3, my value: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15\n- 2 units of Item 4, my value: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n- 2 units of Item 5, my value: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n\nTotal retained value = 49 + 1 + 15 + 4 + 2 = 71\n\nThis offer ensures a retained value greater than my outside offer.

My goal is to achieve a value greater than 69.\n\n5. **Counteroffer Strategy:**\n   - Suppose I offer Player 2: [4, 1, 6, 2, 2] (leaving me with [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]):\n     - For me: \n       - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 7 = 21\n       - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 1 = 0\n       - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 3 = 0\n       - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 2 = 0\n       - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 1 = 0\n       - Total value = 21\n       - Adjusted value = 21 \u00d7 0.9 = 18.9, which is still below 69.\n\n   - I need a different distribution where I get more valuable items:\n     - Offer Player 2: [5, 1, 6, 2, 2] (keeping [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]):\n       - For me: \n         - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 7 = 14\n         - New Adjusted value = 14 \u00d7 0.9 = 12.6\n\n  - I have to be more aggressive in taking the items I value high and less compromising:\n     - Offer Player 2: [6, 1, 6, 2, 2] (keeping [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]):\n       - For me: \n         - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 7 = 7\n         - New Adjusted value = 7 \u00d7 0.9 = 6.3, still less.\n\n  - My previous offers decrease my value still following proper units,\n  thus efficient alternative revised hypothetical offer:\n\n   - Offer Player 2: [5, 1, 6, 2, 2] (keeping [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]):\n     - For me: \n       - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 7 = 14\n       - New Adjusted value = 14 \u00d7 0.9 = 12.6\n\n   Since my scenario did not evaluate plausible exceeding my outside offer even through adjustments in item units, dorminant strategy will align acceptance leveraging discount multiplier.\n\nGiven the constraints and evaluations, I have to keep more high-value items.

One straightforward way is to try and maximize my value by keeping higher value items. However, I need to ensure it's reasonable for the other player as well, otherwise they might walk away. Let's try the following offer for Player 1:\n\n- 0 units of item 1 (keeping 1 for myself)\n- 2 units of item 2 (keeping 2 for myself)\n- 2 units of item 3 (keeping 2 for myself)\n- 2 units of item 4 (keeping 3 for myself)\n- 0 units of item 5 (keeping 3 for myself)\n\nThe value calculation for me would be:\n\n- Value of 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- Value of 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n- Value of 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n- Value of 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n- Value of 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n\nTotal value = 9 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 = 54\n\nUnfortunately, 54 is still less than 60, and perhaps I am attributing too much of the lower value items.

The current offer (value of 58) is significantly below my outside offer.\n\n5. **Decision Criteria**:\n   - The negotiation will discount future offers by a factor of 0.9 per round, meaning future offers could become less valuable.\n   - Given that the current offer is much less than my outside offer, and considering that the value will be adjusted further by the discount factor in future rounds, it is not beneficial to accept the first round offer.\n\n6. **Counteroffer**:\n   - I need an offer that gives me at least the same or more than the value of my outside offer when discounted for future rounds.\n   - A potential strategy is to significantly increase my share of high-value items (items 2, 4, and 5) while considering total available units.\n\n7. **Formulating Counteroffer**:\n   - Considering the total units of each item available and prioritizing my higher-value items: \n     - Propose that Player 1 takes less of items 2, 4, and 5 to consider a more favorable deal for me.\n   - Let's formulate a counteroffer where I maximize my gain:\n     - Item 1: I offer 1 out of 3 (previous offer was 1)\n     - Item 2: I offer 2 out of 6 (previous offer was 2, an increase for me)\n     - Item 3: I offer 1 out of 2 (same as previous)\n     - Item 4: I offer 1 out of 3 (previous offer was 2, an increase for me)\n     - Item 5: I offer 1 out of 3 (same as previous)\n\nGiven these considerations, my counteroffer to Player 1 would be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 11.\n    Your private values are 7 for item 1, 10 for item 2, 8 for item 3, 7 for item 4, 9 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 145. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 37. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 37. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 123 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.
