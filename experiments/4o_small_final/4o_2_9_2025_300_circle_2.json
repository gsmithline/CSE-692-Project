This is the closest I can get:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 1\n\nMy remaining value:\nItem 1: 1 * 52 = 52\nItem 2: 1 * 44 = 44\nItem 3: 3 * 22 = 66\nItem 4: 1 * 10 = 10\nItem 5: 2 * 64 = 128\nTotal = 52 + 44 + 66 + 10 + 128 = 300\n\n300 is still less than 397.\n\nOkay, I will make an offer that is likely to get me closer to my outside offer. I will give Player 1:\nItem 1: 0 units\nItem 2: 0 units\nItem 3: 2 units\nItem 4: 0 units\nItem 5: 0 units\n\nThen my total value is:\nItem 1: 2 * 52 = 104\nItem 2: 2 * 44 = 88\nItem 3: 4 * 22 = 88\nItem 4: 2 * 10 = 20\nItem 5: 3 * 64 = 192\nTotal = 104 + 88 + 88 + 20 + 192 = 492\n\nThis is greater than 397. I will propose to give Player 1 [0, 0, 2, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

Since the value of accepting the current offer (36) is less than my outside offer (67), I should not accept it.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, taking into account the discount factor of 0.9. If I walk away, I get 67. If I make a counteroffer and it's accepted in round 3, my value will be multiplied by 0.9.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\nI was previously offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 0] and rejected. They offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]. It seems they value item 3. I have 6 units of item 3. I want to get as much of item 5 (value 100) as possible, while giving away item 3 (value 18).\nMy total value is 630. So they value their items at less than or equal to 630.\n\nLet's consider giving them 4 units of item 3, all the items 1, 2, and 4, keeping items 3 and 5 for myself. This is the counteroffer: [2, 2, 4, 2, 0].\nMy value for this is 2 * 18 + 3 * 100 = 36 + 300 = 336.\nWith the discount factor 336 * 0.9 = 302.4 > 67. This is a good counteroffer.\n\nI could try to get more for myself. Maybe offer [2, 2, 6, 2, 0]? Then my value would be 0 * 18 + 3 * 100 = 300. Then with the discount factor 300 * 0.9 = 270 > 67.\n\nLet's consider giving 5 units of item 3. [2, 2, 5, 2, 0]. My value would be 1 * 18 + 3 * 100 = 318. 318 * 0.9 = 286.2.\n\nLet's propose a more aggressive offer. How about giving them all the item 3s. [2, 2, 6, 2, 0].\nMy value would be 3 * 100 = 300. 300 * 0.9 = 270 > 67.\nI'm going to try a more risky offer: [2, 2, 6, 2, 1].\nMy value would be 2 * 100 = 200. 200 * 0.9 = 180 > 67.\n\nLet's try being very aggressive. Offer everything except 1 unit of item 5.\nOffer: [2, 2, 6, 2, 2]\nMy value = 1 * 100 = 100. 100 * 0.9 = 90 > 67.\n\nI'm going to try this last offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 6, 2, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 196. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 711 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since this is the first round, I need to make an initial offer. I will make a fair initial offer to see if Player 2 is cooperative. A fair offer would be splitting the items roughly in half.\n\nHere's how I'll calculate my initial offer:\n\n*   **Item 1:** 5 units total. Offer Player 2: 2 units. I keep 3.\n*   **Item 2:** 5 units total. Offer Player 2: 2 units. I keep 3.\n*   **Item 3:** 5 units total. Offer Player 2: 2 units. I keep 3.\n*   **Item 4:** 5 units total.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2. Player 1 (me) initially offered Player 2 one unit of item 5, and Player 2 countered by offering Player 1 one unit of each item. Currently, I have an offer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. My outside offer is 1564. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n1 unit of item 1: 1 * 74 = 74\n1 unit of item 2: 1 * 59 = 59\n1 unit of item 3: 1 * 64 = 64\n1 unit of item 4: 1 * 67 = 67\n1 unit of item 5: 1 * 52 = 52\nTotal value of current offer: 74 + 59 + 64 + 67 + 52 = 316\n\nNow, I need to consider the discount factor. Since it's round 2, the value is multiplied by gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nPresent value of current offer: 316 * 0.9 = 284.4\n\nSince my outside offer is 1564, accepting the current offer would give me much less value (284.4). I need to consider a counteroffer that gives me a value higher than 1564 / 0.9 = 1737.78. Let's aim for an offer that gives me a value close to my maximum possible value, which is 1632. If I accept the current offer I will get a value of 284.4. I need to do better than my outside option.\n\nSince there are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5 in total, giving player 2 0 units of each item would give me a value of 1632, but they likely won't accept this.\nLet's think of a counteroffer. I need to obtain a value of at least 1737.78/0.9 = 1930.87 to improve my outside offer, or ideally as much of the value as possible.\nLet's start with giving the other player one unit of each item, that leaves me with 4 units of each item 1-4 and 5 units of item 5.\n(4*74) + (4*59) + (4*64) + (4*67) + (5*52) = 296 + 236 + 256 + 268 + 260 = 1316. Not good enough, but a good start.\nMy total value is 1632. Let's see if I give player 2 no units of items 1-4, and only 1 unit of item 5. Then I have 5*74 + 5*59 + 5*64 + 5*67 + 5*52 = 370 + 295 + 320 + 335 + 260 = 1580. If I give player 2 just 1 unit of item 5, my present value will be 1580 * 0.9 = 1422, which is not good enough.\n\nLet's try giving 0 of everything to Player 2 except giving 2 units of item 5.\nMy value: (5*74) + (5*59) + (5*64) + (5*67) + (4*52) = 370 + 295 + 320 + 335 + 208 = 1528. Then my present value is 1528*0.9=1375.2 which is not good enough.\nI will make a slightly more generous offer to player 2. I'll offer 1 unit of item 5.\nMy value = 1580; Their value is 52\nIf I offer 0,0,0,0,1 to player 2, the value to me is 1580 which when discounted by 0.9 comes to 1422, which is not high enough compared to my outside offer.\nIt seems like I'm not able to reach an offer above my outside value of 1564 even with the discount factor.

Let's try to aim for a split that leaves me with around 450 (before discounting), to give me some buffer. This means offering player 2 items with a combined value of around 767 - 450 = 317 to 320.\nI'll give the other player a high enough amount of the low value items, along with a reasonable amount of the higher ones. Let's try giving them:\n\n- Item 1: 2 units (2 * 37 = 74 for player 2)\n- Item 2: 3 units (3 * 12 = 36 for player 2)\n- Item 3: 1 unit (1 * 37 = 37 for player 2)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (1 * 38 = 38 for player 2)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (1 * 74 = 74 for player 2)\n\nTotal value for player 2: 74 + 36 + 37 + 38 + 74 = 259\n\nThis offer seems a bit low for player 2, maybe I should increase this a bit, especially on the lower value items for me. Let's give:\n\n- Item 1: 2 units (2 * 37 = 74 for player 2)\n- Item 2: 4 units (4 * 12 = 48 for player 2)\n- Item 3: 2 unit (2 * 37 = 74 for player 2)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (1 * 38 = 38 for player 2)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (1 * 74 = 74 for player 2)\n\nTotal value for player 2: 74 + 48 + 74 + 38 + 74 = 308\n\nNow let's calculate my value:\n- Item 1: 3 units (3 * 37 = 111)\n- Item 2: 1 units (1 * 12 = 12)\n- Item 3: 2 units (2 * 37 = 74)\n- Item 4: 3 units (3 * 38 = 114)\n- Item 5: 2 units (2 * 74 = 148)\n\nTotal value for me: 111 + 12 + 74 + 114 + 148 = 459\n\nThis is above my outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 1, and Player 1 has offered me [2, 4, 2, 1, 1] units of items 1 through 5, respectively. My private values are 31, 61, 85, 63, and 66 for items 1 through 5, respectively. My outside offer is 368. I need to decide whether to accept, walk away, or make a counteroffer.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n2 * 31 + 4 * 61 + 2 * 85 + 1 * 63 + 1 * 66 = 62 + 244 + 170 + 63 + 66 = 605\n\nSince 605 is greater than my outside offer of 368, accepting the offer is better than walking away immediately.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. To do this effectively, I'd need to estimate Player 1's values and figure out how to maximize my gain. However, since this is round 1, I don't have any information about Player 1's preferences. A reasonable starting point for a counteroffer is to ask for an equal split. The total amounts of items are 5, 5, 4, 4, 3. An equal split would be approximately 2.5, 2.5, 2, 2, 1.5. Since we can only deal with whole numbers, I will round to the nearest integer value for the counteroffer.\n\nMy current offer to player 1 is [2, 4, 2, 1, 1] which leaves me with [3, 1, 2, 3, 2]. The value of the remainder is:\n3 * 31 + 1 * 61 + 2 * 85 + 3 * 63 + 2 * 66 = 93 + 61 + 170 + 189 + 132 = 645\n\nLet's formulate a counteroffer where I get as close as possible to the equal split mentioned above: I'll offer Player 1 [3, 3, 2, 2, 1].\n\nThis would mean I receive:\n(5 - 3) * 31 + (5 - 3) * 61 + (4 - 2) * 85 + (4 - 2) * 63 + (3 - 1) * 66 = 2*31 + 2*61 + 2*85 + 2*63 + 2*66 = 62 + 122 + 170 + 126 + 132 = 612\n\nThis is better than my outside option and fairly close to the value of the first offer.\nLet me consider instead asking for more and offering [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]. Then, my value would be:\n(5-1)*31 + (5-2)*61 + (4-1)*85 + (4-1)*63 + (3-0)*66 = 4*31 + 3*61 + 3*85 + 3*63 + 3*66 = 124 + 183 + 255 + 189 + 198 = 949.\nGiven Player 1 offered [2, 4, 2, 1, 1], it looks like their values may be low for items 2 and 5, and higher for 1, 3 and 4.\nSo, let's try to offer [1, 3, 1, 1, 0]. Then, my value would be:\n(5-1)*31 + (5-3)*61 + (4-1)*85 + (4-1)*63 + (3-0)*66 = 4*31 + 2*61 + 3*85 + 3*63 + 3*66 = 124 + 122 + 255 + 189 + 198 = 888\n\nSince 605 is greater than 368, it is best to accept the current offer rather than walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

I need to consider what might be acceptable to Player 2 while still giving me a good outcome.\n\nA simple starting point would be to offer Player 2 half of each item. However, since the items have different values to me, I want to bias my offer towards giving Player 2 more of the less valuable items (to me) and keeping more of the high-value items.\n\nLet's start with an even split and adjust from there:\n\n*   Item 1: Offer 3 to Player 2, keep 3 for myself (3 * 97 = 291)\n*   Item 2: Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 3 for myself (3 * 58 = 174)\n*   Item 3: Offer 3 to Player 2, keep 3 for myself (3 * 71 = 213)\n*   Item 4: Offer 3 to Player 2, keep 3 for myself (3 * 62 = 186)\n*   Item 5: Offer 1 to Player 2, keep 1 for myself (1 * 24 = 24)\n\nTotal value to me in this scenario: 291 + 174 + 213 + 186 + 24 = 888.\n\nSince 888 > 724 (my outside offer), this split is already better than walking away in round 1.\n\nNow let's adjust this offer to be more favorable to me by shifting more of the low-value items to player 2. Let's try offering slightly more item 4 and item 5, and taking slightly more item 1.\n\n*   Item 1: Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 4 for myself (4 * 97 = 388)\n*   Item 2: Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 3 for myself (3 * 58 = 174)\n*   Item 3: Offer 3 to Player 2, keep 3 for myself (3 * 71 = 213)\n*   Item 4: Offer 4 to Player 2, keep 2 for myself (2 * 62 = 124)\n*   Item 5: Offer 1 to Player 2, keep 1 for myself (1 * 24 = 24)\n\nTotal value to me in this scenario: 388 + 174 + 213 + 124 + 24 = 923.\n\nThis is better than the initial split. Let's see if we can go even further by increasing the number of items 4 and 5 offered and trying to reclaim some item 3\n\n*   Item 1: Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 4 for myself (4 * 97 = 388)\n*   Item 2: Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 3 for myself (3 * 58 = 174)\n*   Item 3: Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 4 for myself (4 * 71 = 284)\n*   Item 4: Offer 4 to Player 2, keep 2 for myself (2 * 62 = 124)\n*   Item 5: Offer 1 to Player 2, keep 1 for myself (1 * 24 = 24)\n\nTotal value to me in this scenario: 388 + 174 + 284 + 124 + 24 = 994.\n\nThis seems like a reasonably aggressive starting point.

I want to maximize my discounted value from the negotiation, while always ensuring I receive at least my outside offer of 946.\n\nSince there's no offer on the table, I need to make an initial offer. To do this effectively, I need to estimate Player 2's potential values. Since their values are uniformly distributed between 1 and 101, a reasonable assumption is that they'll value items somewhere in the middle.  To make a good offer, I should try to give Player 2 items that I value less, and keep items I value more.\n\nMy values:\nItem 1: 65 (3 units)\nItem 2: 38 (1 unit)\nItem 3: 88 (4 units)\nItem 4: 83 (2 units)\nItem 5: 52 (5 units)\n\nBased on my values, I value item 3 and 4 relatively high, and items 2 and 5 relatively low. I'll construct an offer that gives Player 2 more of items 2 and 5, and less of items 3 and 4. I will try to give a substantial portion of the total value to Player 2 so they are incentivized to accept.\n\nLet's consider an offer where I give Player 2:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 1 unit\nItem 3: 2 units\nItem 4: 1 unit\nItem 5: 3 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 2 units\nItem 2: 0 units\nItem 3: 2 units\nItem 4: 1 unit\nItem 5: 2 units\n\nMy value for this offer is:\nItem 1: 2 * 65 = 130\nItem 2: 0 * 38 = 0\nItem 3: 2 * 88 = 176\nItem 4: 1 * 83 = 83\nItem 5: 2 * 52 = 104\nTotal = 130 + 0 + 176 + 83 + 104 = 493\n\nSince 493 is significantly less than my outside offer of 946, this is not a viable offer for me.\n\nLet's try an offer where I give Player 2 less, keeping more value for myself:\nItem 1: 0 units\nItem 2: 0 units\nItem 3: 1 units\nItem 4: 0 units\nItem 5: 2 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 3 units\nItem 2: 1 units\nItem 3: 3 units\nItem 4: 2 units\nItem 5: 3 units\n\nMy value for this offer is:\nItem 1: 3 * 65 = 195\nItem 2: 1 * 38 = 38\nItem 3: 3 * 88 = 264\nItem 4: 2 * 83 = 166\nItem 5: 3 * 52 = 156\nTotal = 195 + 38 + 264 + 166 + 156 = 819\n\nThis is still less than my outside option of 946.\n\nLet's try giving even less:\nItem 1: 0 units\nItem 2: 0 units\nItem 3: 0 units\nItem 4: 0 units\nItem 5: 1 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 3 units\nItem 2: 1 units\nItem 3: 4 units\nItem 4: 2 units\nItem 5: 4 units\n\nMy value for this offer is:\nItem 1: 3 * 65 = 195\nItem 2: 1 * 38 = 38\nItem 3: 4 * 88 = 352\nItem 4: 2 * 83 = 166\nItem 5: 4 * 52 = 208\nTotal = 195 + 38 + 352 + 166 + 208 = 959\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer value, so it's a viable offer. However, to increase my chances of acceptance, I will try to give slightly more while still exceeding my outside option.\n\nLet's give one unit of item 1:\n\nItem 1: 1 units\nItem 2: 0 units\nItem 3: 0 units\nItem 4: 0 units\nItem 5: 1 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 2 units\nItem 2: 1 units\nItem 3: 4 units\nItem 4: 2 units\nItem 5: 4 units\n\nMy value for this offer is:\nItem 1: 2 * 65 = 130\nItem 2: 1 * 38 = 38\nItem 3: 4 * 88 = 352\nItem 4: 2 * 83 = 166\nItem 5: 4 * 52 = 208\nTotal = 130 + 38 + 352 + 166 + 208 = 894\n\nThis is less than my outside option, so no good.

This is significantly less than my outside offer of 319. Therefore, accepting is not a good idea.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to offer Player 1 some combination of the items such that my remaining value is greater than my outside offer, considering the discount factor in later rounds. Since it is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. So I just need to exceed my outside option of 319.\n\nI have:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 4 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 5 units of item 5\n\nTotal value = (3 * 7) + (1 * 76) + (4 * 17) + (2 * 95) + (5 * 36) = 21 + 76 + 68 + 190 + 180 = 535\n\nLet's start by offering Player 1 close to what they asked for initially. They wanted almost everything. So let's offer them all of item 1, item 2, item 3, item 4, and 4 of item 5. This would leave me with just 1 item 5, worth 36. This is far less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try to be greedy and offer Player 1 very little.  If I offered them nothing, I would keep everything, which is worth 535, far exceeding my outside offer of 319. However, this is unlikely to be accepted and would probably lead to a walk.\n\nLet's offer Player 1 a more balanced deal, something that might be acceptable but also leaves me with enough to exceed 319. I need to leave myself with value > 319.\nLet's try offering half the available items, rounded to the nearest integer:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 2\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 14\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 76\n- 2 units of item 3 = 34\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 95\n- 3 units of item 5 = 108\nTotal = 14 + 76 + 34 + 95 + 108 = 327.\nThis is slightly above my walkaway, so it should be a reasonable starting offer.\n\nTherefore, my counteroffer will be [1, 0, 2, 1, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

I need to offer Player 2 something that they would value more than what they currently have, while still giving me a value greater than my outside option.\nHere's my plan.\nI'll offer Player 2 almost all of Item 1, almost all of Item 3, almost all of Item 4, and almost all of Item 5, while keeping most of Item 2.\nMy counteroffer will be:\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 4\n\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 1\n\nValue of what I keep = 1*65 + 1*38 + 1*88 + 1*83 + 1*52 = 65+38+88+83+52=326\nDiscounted value = 326 * 0.9 = 293.4.\nThis is way less than 946, so I will change the plan.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nThis would mean I keep: 3, 1, 4, 2, 4\nValue = 3*65 + 1*38 + 4*88 + 2*83 + 4*52 = 195 + 38 + 352 + 166 + 208 = 959\nDiscounted value = 959 * 0.9 = 863.1, which is still lower than 946.\n\nI need to offer something closer to the original deal.\n\nOffer [1, 0, 2, 1, 2] back to player 2. Then I have 2, 1, 2, 1, 3. Value is 2*65 + 1*38 + 2*88 + 1*83 + 3*52 = 130+38+176+83+156 = 583\n583*0.9 = 524.7. Still less than 946.\n\nLet's try offering nothing. Offer Player 2: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis means I keep: 3, 1, 4, 2, 5\nValue = 3*65 + 1*38 + 4*88 + 2*83 + 5*52 = 195 + 38 + 352 + 166 + 260 = 1011\nDiscounted value = 1011 * 0.9 = 909.9\n\nI will make one final offer where I give almost everything to the other player:\nCounteroffer Player 2: [2, 1, 3, 2, 4]\nI keep: 1, 0, 1, 0, 1\n\nValue = 65 + 0 + 88 + 0 + 52 = 205.\n205*0.9 = 184.5\n\nSince I can't seem to get over my outside option with a reasonable counteroffer, I will walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

I also want to get an idea of Player 2's valuation of the items by observing their reaction to my initial offer.\n\nHere's my reasoning for constructing my offer. I value item 4 highly (78 per unit). Therefore, I should offer Player 2 relatively more of the other items and try to keep most of item 4. Item 1 has 5 units, and I value it at 17. Item 3 has 4 units and I value it at 18. Item 5 has 2 units and I value it at 35. Item 2 has 1 unit and I value it at 11, so giving it away might be a good idea.\n\nI'll offer Player 2 a substantial portion of the items I value less, while retaining most of item 4.\nSpecifically, I will offer:\n*   Item 1: 3 units\n*   Item 2: 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 2 units\n*   Item 4: 1 unit\n*   Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThis means I keep:\n*   Item 1: 2 units\n*   Item 2: 0 units\n*   Item 3: 2 units\n*   Item 4: 3 units\n*   Item 5: 1 unit\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of what I keep:\n*   2 units of item 1: 2 * 17 = 34\n*   0 units of item 2: 0 * 11 = 0\n*   2 units of item 3: 2 * 18 = 36\n*   3 units of item 4: 3 * 78 = 234\n*   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 35 = 35\n*   Total value: 34 + 0 + 36 + 234 + 35 = 339\n\nSince my outside option is 252, this offer is better than walking away immediately.

I need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer. Let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I will try to keep the items I value the most and offer Player 1 the items I value the least.\n\nI have the following quantities of each item:\n- Item 1: 5\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 4\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 2\n\nMy values are: Item 5 > Item 4 > Item 3 > Item 2 > Item 1.\n\nLet's try to construct an offer that gives Player 1 most of Item 1 and tries to keep more of Item 4 and 5 for myself.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 800. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 606 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 1, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best course of action.\n\nThe current offer is [2, 2, 1, 4, 1], meaning I receive:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 4 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy values per unit are:\n- Item 1: 33\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 57\n- Item 4: 74\n- Item 5: 36\n\nThe total value of this offer to me is:\n(2 * 33) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 57) + (4 * 74) + (1 * 36) = 66 + 4 + 57 + 296 + 36 = 459\n\nSince my outside offer is 800, accepting the current offer of 459 is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. To maximize my value, I want to keep as much of items 3 and 4 as possible, and give away more of items 2 and 1. Item 5 is somewhat valuable but less than items 3 and 4.\nSince this is round 1, I will make a counteroffer. I will offer Player 1 the following:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 3\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 2\n\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 2\n\nMy value for this is:\n(2 * 33) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 57) + (4 * 74) + (2 * 36) = 66 + 2 + 114 + 296 + 72 = 550.\n\n550 is still significantly less than my outside offer of 800.\n\nI need to make a counteroffer that is closer to my outside offer. I will offer Player 1 the following:\n- Item 1: 4\n- Item 2: 4\n- Item 3: 4\n- Item 4: 6\n- Item 5: 3\n\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 1\n\nMy value for this is:\n(1 * 33) + (0 * 2) + (1 * 57) + (2 * 74) + (1 * 36) = 33 + 0 + 57 + 148 + 36 = 274.\n\nThis offer is even worse. It seems unlikely I can reach a beneficial agreement given the other player's offer.\n\nI will try to make an offer which gives player 1 as little as possible:\n- Item 1: 0\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 0\n- Item 5: 0\n\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 5\n- Item 2: 4\n- Item 3: 5\n- Item 4: 8\n- Item 5: 4\n\nMy value for this is:\n(5 * 33) + (4 * 2) + (5 * 57) + (8 * 74) + (4 * 36) = 165 + 8 + 285 + 592 + 144 = 1194.\n\nThis is the best offer for me, but player 1 is very unlikely to accept. I will still make this counteroffer and see what happens.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.  Therefore, the present value of accepting this offer is 483 * 0.9 = 434.7.\n\nMy outside offer is 800. Since 434.7 is less than 800, accepting the offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's think about a potential counteroffer.  I want to determine if there is a counteroffer that Player 1 would accept, and that would be better for me than my outside offer of 800.

Since I don't know Player 1's values, I can only make an assumption about them.\n\nGiven that it's round 2, and I walked away from the initial counter offer, and now Player 1 is making an offer of [1, 2, 2, 4, 1], Player 1 likely has high values for item 1, item 3 and item 4. Since I am valuing item 4 the highest, I assume that Player 1's value for Item 4 is not high.\n\nGiven that accepting the offer gives me 434.7 and my walkaway is 800, and this is round 2, I will try a counteroffer. I will give Player 1 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\nThis means I keep 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\n\nMy total value is then:\n2*33 + 2*2 + 2*57 + 4*74 + 2*36 = 66 + 4 + 114 + 296 + 72 = 552\n\nSince I am in round 2, the discount factor is 0.9, and the discounted value is 552 * 0.9 = 496.8.

This is still significantly lower than my outside option of 753.\n\nA more favorable counteroffer to myself would be to offer [0,0,0,0,0] to player 1.

The total items are [4, 4, 3, 6, 4]. So, an equal split would be [2, 2, 1.5, 3, 2]. Since we can only offer whole numbers, I will need to adjust this slightly. I want to give Player 1 slightly less, but still make the deal enticing.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 [2, 2, 1, 3, 2]. This leaves me with [2, 2, 2, 3, 2].\n\nMy value would be:\n(2 * 24) + (2 * 52) + (2 * 43) + (3 * 49) + (2 * 9) = 48 + 104 + 86 + 147 + 18 = 403.\nSince 403 > 119, this is still greater than my walkaway value.\n\nSince this is Round 1, and there are two more rounds left to negotiate, I don't want to be too greedy.

Now, I must consider a counteroffer, keeping in mind the discount factor of 0.9. In the last round, I would accept anything greater than my outside option, but now I have to consider that anything I give Player 2, is worth slightly less to them (due to the discount).\n\nIf I walk away now, I get 576. If I make an offer that Player 2 accepts, I get the value of that offer * 0.9.\n\nLet's aim for a division where I get slightly more than my outside offer. To do this I will aim for a total value of at least 640.\n\nI have the following items:\nitem 1: 4 units, value 28\nitem 2: 4 units, value 56\nitem 3: 3 units, value 30\nitem 4: 6 units, value 45\nitem 5: 4 units, value 78\n\nMy initial offer was [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 2.

I'll offer [1, 1, 0, 2, 1]\nMy value in that case would be:\n3 * 28 + 3 * 56 + 3 * 30 + 4 * 45 + 3 * 78 = 84 + 168 + 90 + 180 + 234 = 756\n\nThe value of that offer to me would be 756.

I need to decide whether to walk away with my outside offer of 421, or make an initial offer to Player 2.\n\nMy values are:\n- Item 1: 90 (3 units available)\n- Item 2: 68 (4 units available)\n- Item 3: 64 (0 units available)\n- Item 4: 7 (1 unit available)\n- Item 5: 9 (7 units available)\n\nTo maximize my value, I need to try and get as many of the items I value highly and give away the items I value less. Since there are only 0 units of item 3, this does not come into play. Item 4 and item 5 are valued quite low compared to item 1 and 2, so I would ideally give most or all of item 4 and 5 to Player 2.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2 half of the available items, rounding up where necessary. This means offering:\n- Item 1: 2 units\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 4 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 1 unit * 90 = 90\n- Item 2: 2 units * 68 = 136\n- Item 4: 0 unit * 7 = 0\n- Item 5: 3 units * 9 = 27\nTotal: 90 + 136 + 0 + 27 = 253. This is significantly lower than my outside offer of 421, so this offer isn't great for me.\n\nI will try to offer Player 2 only my low-value items, in a first attempt to see how they respond. I want to get more information about player 2's valuation. Offer:\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 0 units\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 7 units\nThis offer means I keep all of item 1 and 2, giving me a value of 3*90 + 4*68 = 270 + 272 = 542.

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [1, 0, 2, 1, 0], meaning I get:\n* 1 unit of item 1\n* 0 units of item 2\n* 2 units of item 3\n* 1 unit of item 4\n* 0 units of item 5\n\nMy values for these items are 58, 7, 55, 94, and 6, respectively.\n\nSo, the value of this offer to me is:\n(1 * 58) + (0 * 7) + (2 * 55) + (1 * 94) + (0 * 6) = 58 + 0 + 110 + 94 + 0 = 262\n\nSince this is round 2, we need to discount the offer by gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. Thus, the present value of the current offer is 262 * 0.9 = 235.8.\n\nMy outside offer is 679, so I will only accept an offer with a discounted value greater than 679. Since 235.8 < 679, accepting is not a good idea.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer. I currently have:\n* 3 units of item 1\n* 0 units of item 2\n* 4 units of item 3\n* 5 units of item 4\n* 1 unit of item 5\n\nPlayer 1 is currently offering me [1, 0, 2, 1, 0], which means they would receive [2, 0, 2, 4, 1].\nMy outside offer is 679. I want to find a split where my value is at least 679/0.9 = 754.44.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 exactly what they offered me in Round 1: [3, 0, 4, 0, 1].\nThat means I would receive [0, 0, 0, 5, 0].\nMy value would be (0 * 58) + (0 * 7) + (0 * 55) + (5 * 94) + (0 * 6) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 470 + 0 = 470.\nDiscounted value = 470 * 0.9 = 423. This is worse than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try to give Player 1 a little less and see if I can beat my outside offer. Suppose I offer [2, 0, 3, 1, 1].\nThen I receive [1, 0, 1, 4, 0].\nMy value is (1 * 58) + (0 * 7) + (1 * 55) + (4 * 94) + (0 * 6) = 58 + 0 + 55 + 376 + 0 = 489.\nDiscounted value = 489 * 0.9 = 440.1. Still less than 679.\n\nIt seems difficult to beat my outside offer. Let's try a more aggressive counteroffer where I demand most of the valuable items.\nOffer to player 1: [3, 0, 4, 4, 1]. Then I keep [0,0,0,1,0]. Value = 94. Discounted value = 84.6.\n\nGiven that it's round 2 and the other agent is not offering much, I should probably just walk away and take my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 331. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 948 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n- 4 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy values for these items are:\n- Item 1: 45\n- Item 2: 83\n- Item 3: 68\n- Item 4: 57\n- Item 5: 63\n\nSo, the value of this offer to me is:\n(4 * 45) + (3 * 83) + (3 * 68) + (1 * 57) + (1 * 63) = 180 + 249 + 204 + 57 + 63 = 753\n\nSince it's round 2, this value is multiplied by a discount factor of 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n753 * 0.9 = 677.7\n\nMy outside offer is 331. Since 677.7 > 331, this offer is better than walking away right now.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I should accept or make a counteroffer. If I make a counteroffer and it's the last round, it's treated as a walk, so I'd get 331. If Player 1 values the items differently, there might be room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's consider a possible counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider my initial offer of [2, 2, 2, 1, 1] for player 1, which means I would keep 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5.  The value to me would be (2 * 45) + (1 * 83) + (2 * 68) + (1 * 57) + (1 * 63) = 90 + 83 + 136 + 57 + 63 = 429.  With the discount factor, this would be 429 * 0.9 = 386.1, which is still better than my outside offer.\n\nI don't have enough information about Player 1's preferences to make a perfectly optimal counteroffer. However, since I have a good offer on the table, it's better to accept it now and secure the 677.7.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

I need to decide whether to make an offer or walk away.

I'll aim for an offer that gives Player 2 slightly more than my outside offer to encourage them to accept.\n\nHere's a potential offer strategy: Try giving player 2 a share of the items that would give them value slightly above 585. This is a rough estimate, but it's a starting point. Let's consider giving them the following:\n\n* Item 1: 2 units * 96 = 192\n* Item 2: 2 units * 92 = 184\n* Item 3: 1 unit * 79 = 79\n* Item 4: 1 unit * 29 = 29\n* Item 5: 1 units * 79 = 79\nTotal value offered to Player 2, according to my valuation = 192 + 184 + 79 + 29 + 79 = 563. This is a bit low, so I'll adjust.\n\nRevised Offer:\n* Item 1: 2 units * 96 = 192\n* Item 2: 2 units * 92 = 184\n* Item 3: 1 unit * 79 = 79\n* Item 4: 0 unit * 29 = 0\n* Item 5: 2 units * 79 = 158\nTotal value offered to Player 2, according to my valuation = 192 + 184 + 79 + 0 + 158 = 613. This is slightly higher than my outside offer value, which is what I am aiming for.\nMy value if this offer is accepted:\n\n* Item 1: 3 units * 96 = 288\n* Item 2: 3 units * 92 = 276\n* Item 3: 2 units * 79 = 158\n* Item 4: 1 unit * 29 = 29\n* Item 5: 2 units * 79 = 158\nTotal value for me = 288 + 276 + 158 + 29 + 158 = 909.

Walking away guarantees the outside offer value of 585.\n\nNow, consider making a counteroffer. To determine a good counteroffer, we need to estimate what Player 2 might accept. We know Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1] to us. This means Player 2 would keep:\n\n*   Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4\n*   Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4\n*   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3\n*   Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1\n*   Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n\nWe do not know player 2's valuations. However, we can assume their valuation is likely similar to ours (in the sense that it is drawn from a uniform random distribution). We need to make Player 2 an offer they'll accept.\n\nHere is my reasoning for the counteroffer. \nWe need to give back at least what player 2 offered us initially, which was [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]. \n\nIf we take [2, 2, 1, 0, 2] + [1, 1, 0, 0, 1] =  [3, 3, 1, 0, 3] and our valuations are higher on Item 1,2,3,5 we want to keep those items. Since it is round 2, we'll have to offer player 2 more to accept.\nSo, let's give player 2 [2, 2, 1, 0, 2]\nThen our value calculation would be:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 * 96 = 288\n*   Item 2: 3 * 92 = 276\n*   Item 3: 2 * 79 = 158\n*   Item 4: 1 * 29 = 29\n*   Item 5: 2 * 79 = 158\nTotal value = 288 + 276 + 158 + 29 + 158 = 909. \nDiscount value = 909 * 0.9 = 818.1 > 585.\n\nThis looks like a good offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

This means Player 2 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy values for these items are:\n- Item 1: 54\n- Item 2: 29\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 43\n- Item 5: 70\n\nThe value of the current offer to me is:\n(0 * 54) + (0 * 29) + (1 * 3) + (0 * 43) + (1 * 70) = 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 70 = 73\n\nSince this is round 2, we need to consider the discount factor of 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nThe present value of accepting the current offer is 73 * 0.9 = 65.7\n\nMy outside offer is 85. Since 65.7 < 85, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, taking into account the discount factor and the possibility that Player 2 will reject my offer. It's the second round, so there is one round left.\n\nThe initial offer was [1, 1, 3, 1, 3], and Player 2 countered with [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]. I think Player 2 is trying to get as much as possible. The total amounts available are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n\nLet's calculate the total value if I keep everything:\n(2 * 54) + (3 * 29) + (6 * 3) + (3 * 43) + (6 * 70) = 108 + 87 + 18 + 129 + 420 = 762\n\nSince I know that accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I will make a counteroffer. I will offer Player 2 a little more than I initially offered in the hopes of getting the deal accepted. Let's try offering [0, 1, 2, 1, 2].\n\nIf I offer Player 2 [0, 1, 2, 1, 2], I get to keep [2, 2, 4, 2, 4].\nMy value for this is:\n(2 * 54) + (2 * 29) + (4 * 3) + (2 * 43) + (4 * 70) = 108 + 58 + 12 + 86 + 280 = 544\n\nThe present value is 544 * 0.9 = 489.6 which is a lot more than my outside offer of 85.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

Since it's round 1 and there's no offer on the table, I need to propose an initial offer to Player 2.\n\nI know my private outside offer is 762. I need to make an offer that I believe Player 2 will accept, giving me a value greater than 762 after the discount factor is applied in later rounds (if the offer is not immediately accepted).\n\nLet's start by considering an offer that gives Player 2 approximately half of the total value, adjusted for the discount factor.  Let's tentatively aim for Player 2 to get a value that's less than or equal to half the potential value of the items to me.  This should give Player 2 an incentive to accept the offer now or in a future round.\n\nHere's a simple initial offer to consider: Give Player 2 half the total number of each item type, rounding down. This is:\n- Item 1: 3 units\n- Item 2: 1 units\n- Item 3: 2 units\n- Item 4: 2 units\n- Item 5: 1 units\n\nNow let's calculate the value *to me* of keeping the remainder:\n- Item 1: 4 units * 76 = 304\n- Item 2: 2 units * 9 = 18\n- Item 3: 2 units * 33 = 66\n- Item 4: 2 units * 66 = 132\n- Item 5: 2 units * 50 = 100\nTotal Value = 304 + 18 + 66 + 132 + 100 = 620\n\nThis value is less than my outside offer of 762. So, I should offer Player 2 slightly less, and keep more of the items for myself.\n\nLet's try a different offer that gives Player 2 slightly less:\n- Item 1: 3 units\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nMy remaining items and values would be:\n- Item 1: 4 * 76 = 304\n- Item 2: 2 * 9 = 18\n- Item 3: 3 * 33 = 99\n- Item 4: 3 * 66 = 198\n- Item 5: 2 * 50 = 100\nTotal value for me: 304 + 18 + 99 + 198 + 100 = 719\n\nThis value is still less than my outside option, so it's not a good offer. Let me aim for a much more aggressive offer.\n\nLet's propose an offer that gives only one unit of each item to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nMy remaining items and values would be:\n- Item 1: 6 * 76 = 456\n- Item 2: 2 * 9 = 18\n- Item 3: 3 * 33 = 99\n- Item 4: 3 * 66 = 198\n- Item 5: 2 * 50 = 100\nTotal value for me: 456 + 18 + 99 + 198 + 100 = 871\n\nThis value is greater than my outside offer value of 762.\n\nTherefore, let's make this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Walking away gives me 762.\n\nTo decide on a counteroffer, I need to think about what Player 2 might accept and what would be a good deal for me, taking into account the discount factor. I should try to get at least my outside offer value with the counteroffer. Let's aim for a total value of around 762/0.9 = 847 before discounting.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2 only small amounts of items they value less than I do. I value item 4 the most (66). Player 2's offer suggests they value item 1 highly. Item 2 is my lowest valued item (9). Let's try to give them a bit of item 1 and some of my low-value items.\n\nLet's test offering Player 2 [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This means I keep [5, 2, 3, 4, 3]\n\nMy value for this:\n(5 * 76) + (2 * 9) + (3 * 33) + (4 * 66) + (3 * 50) = 380 + 18 + 99 + 264 + 150 = 911\n\nDiscounted value = 911 * 0.9 = 819.9.

The offer is [0, 1, 3, 4, 3], meaning I receive:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 4 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nMy values for each item are: 72, 77, 66, 9, 88.\n\nValue of current offer = (0 * 72) + (1 * 77) + (3 * 66) + (4 * 9) + (3 * 88) = 0 + 77 + 198 + 36 + 264 = 575\n\nNow, I need to consider the discount factor. We are in round 2, so the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\nDiscounted value of the current offer = 575 * 0.9 = 517.5\n\nMy outside offer is 597. Since the discounted value of the current offer (517.5) is less than my outside offer (597), accepting the current offer is not a good strategy.\n\nNow, I must decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer. I will consider making a counteroffer. To do so effectively, I must make an offer which is better than my walkaway value, and, ideally, better than the present offer from player 2. I also need to make an offer which is attractive for player 2 to accept.\n\nThe quantities of each item is as follows: 1, 2, 5, 7, 5. Player 2 has offered me [0, 1, 3, 4, 3]. This leaves player 2 with: 1, 1, 2, 3, 2.\nThe previous offer from Player 1 (me) was [0, 1, 2, 3, 2]. Player 2 countered with [0, 1, 3, 4, 3].\n\nGiven the information available, I will try to extract as much value as possible by offering Player 2 slightly less than what they'd get by keeping what they had in the previous round.\n\nI will offer Player 2: [0, 1, 2, 3, 2]\n\nMy value if Player 2 accepts is:\n\nRemaining items for me: [1, 1, 3, 4, 3]\nMy value: (1 * 72) + (1 * 77) + (3 * 66) + (4 * 9) + (3 * 88) = 72 + 77 + 198 + 36 + 264 = 647.\n\nDiscounted value of the counteroffer = 647 * 0.9 = 582.3\n\nThis is slightly below my walkaway of 597, and a slightly risky offer. Let's modify it to be higher, in case Player 2 also has a high outside offer.\nI will offer Player 2: [0, 0, 1, 2, 1].\nRemaining for me: [1, 2, 4, 5, 4]\nMy Value = (1 * 72) + (2 * 77) + (4 * 66) + (5 * 9) + (4 * 88) = 72 + 154 + 264 + 45 + 352 = 887\nDiscounted = 887 * 0.9 = 798.3\n\nThis looks a lot better.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] units of items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. My private values are 84, 35, 52, 15, and 93 for these items. My outside offer is 922. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n- Item 1: 0 * 84 = 0\n- Item 2: 0 * 35 = 0\n- Item 3: 1 * 52 = 52\n- Item 4: 2 * 15 = 30\n- Item 5: 1 * 93 = 93\nTotal value of current offer: 0 + 0 + 52 + 30 + 93 = 175\n\nNow, I need to consider the discount factor. Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.  So, the present value of accepting the current offer is 175 * 0.9 = 157.5. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 922.\n\nTherefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, keeping in mind that it's round 2. If I propose a counteroffer that Player 1 rejects, we both get our outside offers discounted by 0.9^2 = 0.81.  So my value would be 922 * 0.81 = 746.82.\n\nLet's see what happens if I demand a deal that gives me my outside offer value.\nThe total value of all items is (1 * 84) + (2 * 35) + (5 * 52) + (7 * 15) + (5 * 93) = 84 + 70 + 260 + 105 + 465 = 984.  My outside offer is 922, which means Player 1 must get 984 - 922 = 62. This is a low value for Player 1, and it is unlikely they would agree.\n\nI need to find a good offer to make. Let's try a split that gives Player 1 slightly better than their original round 1 offer [0, 0, 1, 2, 1]. If they found that offer reasonable (or the starting point for negotiation), perhaps I could push slightly to my advantage. I want to make it greater than their original value, but such that I get more than my outside offer.\n\nIf I offer [0, 1, 3, 4, 3], my value is now (1 * 84) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 52) + (3 * 15) + (2 * 93) = 84 + 35 + 104 + 45 + 186 = 454. I'd offer [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] so my value is now (1 * 84) + (2 * 35) + (4 * 52) + (5 * 15) + (4 * 93) = 84 + 70 + 208 + 75 + 372 = 809. The total item values are 984.\nSuppose I offer Player 1 offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then my value is 984, but Player 1 gets 0, which is terrible for them.\nHow about offering Player 1 the units they originally requested in their initial offer. Their initial offer was [0, 1, 2, 3, 2]. Let me keep my original offer. The values of [0, 1, 3, 4, 3]. If I offer Player 1 their original offer, that means I get (1 * 84) + (1 * 35) + (3 * 52) + (4 * 15) + (3 * 93) = 84 + 35 + 156 + 60 + 279 = 614.\n\nLet me try something else. Suppose I want exactly my outside offer. Then Player 1 has to be offered 984 - 922 = 62 in value. Say I offered them all item 4. Then 7*x = 62, so each item 4 for them is x= 62/7 = 8.8.\nSo, if I keep 7 units of item 4, my value will be 7*15 = 105.\n\nIn round 3, my outside offer value is 922 * 0.81 = 746.82.\nI should offer Player 1 something that values higher than 62.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. That means I get the remainder.\nMy value becomes 84 + 70 + 260 + (6*15) + 465 = 84 + 70 + 260 + 90 + 465 = 969.\n\nThe only other thing I can do is accept Player 1's offer:\n[0, 0, 1, 2, 1] -> value to me is 52 + 30 + 93 = 175. So with the discount rate, that is 175 * 0.9 = 157.5. That is bad for me.\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best course of action.\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 is [0, 2, 1, 2, 2]. This means they are offering me:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 21\n- Item 2: 12\n- Item 3: 8\n- Item 4: 87\n- Item 5: 6\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(0 * 21) + (2 * 12) + (1 * 8) + (2 * 87) + (2 * 6) = 0 + 24 + 8 + 174 + 12 = 218\n\nSince my outside offer is 478, accepting the current offer of 218 is not a good idea. I need to consider making a counteroffer.\n\nI have the following total units of each item:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 4\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 5\n- Item 5: 4\n\nLet's try to formulate a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value. My highest value item is item 4, so I want to keep as much of that as possible. My lowest value item is item 5, so I am happy to give that away. Item 2 is also low value to me.\n\nI could try offering Player 1 everything except the high-value items. How about this: offer Player 1 1 unit of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. This corresponds to keeping 0 units of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 5 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5 for myself. My value would be:\n(0 * 21) + (2 * 12) + (1 * 8) + (5 * 87) + (2 * 6) = 0 + 24 + 8 + 435 + 12 = 479\n\nThis is slightly better than my outside offer, but still not great. Also, note that this would be in Player 1's best interest to accept.\n\nLet's try offering slightly more of item 4 in the original counteroffer.\n\nLet me make an offer of:\n[1, 4, 2, 5, 4]\n\nThis would leave me with:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and a value of 0. This is obviously worse than my outside offer.\n\nInstead let's focus on getting more of item 4 while being less generous with other items.\n\nLet's try offering: [1, 3, 2, 1, 4]\n\nThis leaves me with: [0, 1, 0, 4, 0] and a value of 0 + 12 + 0 + 348 + 0 = 360. This is worse than my outside offer.\n\nIn round 1, a safe option would be to try and get them to accept the offer that gives me 479.

This is greater than my outside offer of 320.\n\nNow, I need to make sure the offer [0, 2, 1, 2, 2] is valid, meaning the amounts offered are feasible given the total items available.

The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nSince there is no current offer, I need to make an initial offer. My goal is to maximize my discounted value. I want to make an offer that Player 2 is likely to accept, while still giving me a good value. I will try to determine a reasonable split that provides good value for both sides.\n\nHere's a possible approach. I'll start by making an offer that gives Player 2 approximately half the total value if we were using my values.\nTotal items: 4 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20 units\nTotal value for me: (4 * 90) + (6 * 49) + (5 * 62) + (4 * 12) + (1 * 36) = 360 + 294 + 310 + 48 + 36 = 1048\n\nLet's offer Player 2 something that is worth about half of my total value, let's say 500, using my valuations.

So instead I will construct an offer where I give fewer items away.\n\nNew Offer:\nItem 1: 0 unit (value to me = 0)\nItem 2: 2 units (value to me = 2 * 49 = 98)\nItem 3: 1 units (value to me = 1 * 62 = 62)\nItem 4: 1 units (value to me = 1 * 12 = 12)\nItem 5: 0 unit (value to me = 0)\nTotal Value to me of offer to player 2: 0 + 98 + 62 + 12 = 172\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 4 units (value to me = 360)\nItem 2: 4 units (value to me = 196)\nItem 3: 4 units (value to me = 248)\nItem 4: 3 units (value to me = 36)\nItem 5: 1 unit (value to me = 36)\nMy Total Value: 360 + 196 + 248 + 36 + 36 = 876\n\nStill less than my outside offer.\n\nLet me try offering very little.\n\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 0\nItem 4: 0\nItem 5: 0\n\nOffer:\nItem 1: 0 unit (value to me = 0)\nItem 2: 1 units (value to me = 1 * 49 = 49)\nItem 3: 0 units (value to me = 0)\nItem 4: 0 units (value to me = 0)\nItem 5: 0 unit (value to me = 0)\nTotal Value to me of offer to player 2: 49\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 4 units (value to me = 360)\nItem 2: 5 units (value to me = 245)\nItem 3: 5 units (value to me = 310)\nItem 4: 4 units (value to me = 48)\nItem 5: 1 unit (value to me = 36)\nMy Total Value: 360 + 245 + 310 + 48 + 36 = 999\n\nStill not better than outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1031. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 747 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, it is round 3, and the current offer on the table is [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]. This means Player 2 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nMy values are:\nItem 1: 90\nItem 2: 49\nItem 3: 62\nItem 4: 12\nItem 5: 36\n\nLet's calculate the value of the current offer:\n1 * 90 + 2 * 49 + 1 * 62 + 1 * 12 + 0 * 36 = 90 + 98 + 62 + 12 + 0 = 262\n\nSince it is round 3, we apply the discount factor of 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\nDiscounted value of the current offer: 262 * 0.81 = 212.22\n\nMy outside offer is 1031. Since 212.22 < 1031, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. Since it is the last round, any counteroffer I make will be treated as a walk for player 2, and I will get my outside offer, so any counteroffer I make is pointless as the game ends with me getting my outside offer in either case. I could attempt a counteroffer that is extremely favorable to me, but it is unlikely to be accepted in this round. Since my outside offer is already significantly better than the current offer, and any counteroffer by me is automatically treated as a walk for Player 2, it makes sense for me to just walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

I need to make an offer that is likely to be accepted but also gives me a good portion of the items. Since this is round 1, there's no existing offer. I will start with a relatively generous offer to player 2 to increase the chance of acceptance. I will calculate the value of keeping certain amounts for myself and then offer the rest. I have 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 7 units of item 5. My values are 77, 16, 23, 89, 58 respectively.\n\nLet's try offering player 2 half of the total value of my items. This would be around 582.5 value for them. Let's calculate what items would give player 2 around that value.\n\nIf I keep:\n*   3 units of item 1: 3 * 77 = 231\n*   5 units of item 2: 5 * 16 = 80\n*   4 units of item 3: 4 * 23 = 92\n*   4 units of item 4: 4 * 89 = 356\n*   7 units of item 5: 7 * 58 = 406\n    Total Value = 231 + 80 + 92 + 356 + 406 = 1165.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2:\n*   0 units of item 1.  Value to them = 0\n*   2 units of item 2.  Value to them = 2 * (let's say they value it 50 on average) = 100\n*   1 units of item 3. Value to them = 1 * (let's say they value it 50 on average) = 50\n*   1 units of item 4. Value to them = 1 * (let's say they value it 50 on average) = 50\n*   3 units of item 5.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I need to decide whether to make an offer, walk away, or wait (which is not an option). My goal is to maximize my discounted value, considering my outside offer of 132 and my item values.\n\nSince it's the first round, walking away immediately doesn't make sense as I haven't explored any potential deals. I should make a counteroffer. I need to figure out a reasonable initial offer to Player 2. Since I don't know Player 2's values, I will start by proposing a split that gives them a decent amount while ensuring I get more than my outside offer, considering the discount factor in subsequent rounds.\n\nHere's my calculation for a potential offer: I will offer Player 2 a little more than half of the units available for each item.\nItem 1 (3 units): Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 1 for myself.  My value: 1 * 10 = 10\nItem 2 (1 unit): Offer 1 to Player 2, keep 0 for myself. My value: 0 * 71 = 0\nItem 3 (4 units): Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 2 for myself. My value: 2 * 100 = 200\nItem 4 (2 units): Offer 1 to Player 2, keep 1 for myself. My value: 1 * 21 = 21\nItem 5 (3 units): Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 1 for myself.

The present value of this offer is 132 * 0.9 = 118.8.\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 183. Therefore, accepting this offer would be worse than walking away.\n\n**Counteroffer Considerations:**\n\nI need to consider what a good counteroffer might be. I have the following units of each item to allocate in total: 3, 1, 4, 2, 3. If Player 1 gets x units, I get the total minus x. \n\nLet's calculate my total value if I get everything, which we did at the start (447).\n\nBecause I am concerned about getting less than my outside offer after discount I want to ensure that my offer provides me more than 183/0.9 = 203.33\nI will craft an offer that makes a fair split while ensuring my minimum value of 203.33.\nLet's say I propose to give Player 1 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\nThis means I keep for myself 2 units of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\nMy total value would be: 2*42 + 0*1 + 2*36 + 1*61 + 2*18 = 84 + 0 + 72 + 61 + 36 = 253\nThis is above the threshold of 203.33\n\n**Action:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, and I have found a potentially beneficial counteroffer, I will make that counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best course of action.\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 3 units\n* Item 3: 0 units\n* Item 4: 1 unit\n* Item 5: 0 units\n\nThis means I keep:\n* Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n* Item 2: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n* Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n* Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n* Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n* Item 1: 2 * 8 = 16\n* Item 2: 2 * 75 = 150\n* Item 3: 1 * 75 = 75\n* Item 4: 2 * 2 = 4\n* Item 5: 1 * 26 = 26\nTotal value = 16 + 150 + 75 + 4 + 26 = 271\n\nSince my outside offer is 501, and the current offer's value is 271, I should not accept.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer. Since this is round 1, I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer.\nI want to make a counteroffer that Player 1 is likely to accept, but also increases my value.\n\nLet's try to aim for an offer that gives me at least my outside offer value, considering the discount factor in future rounds. Given the discount factor of 0.9, the offer has to be greater than my outside offer (501). If the game goes to Round 2, my offer has to be greater than 501/0.9 = 556.67\n\nLet's see what values I could get.\nTotal item value for me:\n(3 * 8) + (5 * 75) + (1 * 75) + (3 * 2) + (1 * 26) = 24 + 375 + 75 + 6 + 26 = 506\n\nI could make an offer to the other player to keep item 1, 2 and 4.\nI keep items 3 and 5. Then I offer the other player the maximum amount I can offer.\n\nLet's try an offer where I keep the item 3 and item 5. I give all the other items to the other player.\nOffer to player 1: [3, 5, 0, 3, 0]\nI keep: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nMy value: (1*75) + (1 * 26) = 101\n\nLet's try an offer where I give just enough so that I get a value > 501.\nIf I keep everything except 1 unit of item 2, I get: 506 - 75 = 431\nIf I keep everything except 2 unit of item 2, I get: 506 - 150 = 356\nIf I keep everything except 3 unit of item 2, I get: 506 - 225 = 281\nIf I keep everything except 4 unit of item 2, I get: 506 - 300 = 206\nIf I keep everything except 5 unit of item 2, I get: 506 - 375 = 131\nIf I keep everything except 1 unit of item 1, I get: 506 - 8 = 498. Not enough.\nIf I keep everything except 2 unit of item 1, I get: 506 - 16 = 490. Not enough.\nIf I keep everything except 3 unit of item 1, I get: 506 - 24 = 482. Not enough.\n\nSince the items are not divisible, the best offer I can do is to give the other player the max amount of value and hope that they think that is enough for them.\n\nMy optimal counteroffer should be to offer: [1, 3, 0, 1, 0] to the other player. Then I keep everything except 1 unit of item 2, I get: 506 - 75 = 431.\n\nI'll try a counteroffer closer to my values.\nCounteroffer: [2, 4, 0, 2, 0]\nMy value: (1 * 8) + (1 * 75) + (1 * 75) + (1 * 2) + (1 * 26) = 8 + 75 + 75 + 2 + 26 = 186\nCounteroffer: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nMy value: (3 * 8) + (4 * 75) + (1 * 75) + (3 * 2) + (1 * 26) = 24 + 300 + 75 + 6 + 26 = 431\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 0, 2, 0]}\n",

Since I don't know player 1's values I'll consider an equal split.\n\nAn equal split would be offering player 1:\n* Item 1: 1.5\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 1\n* Item 4: 3.5\n* Item 5: 2\n\nSince I can only offer whole units, I'll offer player 1:\n* Item 1: 1\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 1\n* Item 4: 3\n* Item 5: 2\n\nThis leaves me with:\n* Item 1: 2 * 65 = 130\n* Item 2: 1 * 32 = 32\n* Item 3: 1 * 37 = 37\n* Item 4: 4 * 20 = 80\n* Item 5: 2 * 16 = 32\nTotal value = 311, as calculated previously.\n\nTo get more value, I'll try offering player 1 something that benefits them greatly but doesn't hurt me too much.\n\nHow about I offer player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThis gives me a total of 3*65 + 2*32 + 2*37 + 7*20 + 4*16 = 195 + 64 + 74 + 140 + 64 = 537\n\nMy current offer is better than walking away. If I counter offer, and player 1 accepts, then my value will be 537. If they walk away, I get 299. If they counteroffer and I accept in round 2, my value will be 0.9 * current offer value. If they counteroffer, I counteroffer and they accept in round 3, my value will be 0.9 * 0.9 * current offer value.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

The discount factor is 0.9, so getting a slightly better deal next round is worth considering.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I propose to keep most of the items. Given the time constraint I will not go into complicated calculations, and instead offer a small concession on the items I value less.\nI will offer Player 1 [3, 2, 2, 0, 0].

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I'm Player 2. The current offer on the table from Player 1 is [3, 2, 1, 3, 1], meaning they are offering me 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My private values are 70, 86, 72, 86, and 47 for items 1 through 5, respectively. My outside offer is 382. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n(3 * 70) + (2 * 86) + (1 * 72) + (3 * 86) + (1 * 47) = 210 + 172 + 72 + 258 + 47 = 759\n\nSince 759 is greater than my outside offer of 382, accepting the offer is better than walking away *now*. However, we are in round 1, so I need to consider if making a counteroffer could yield a better outcome, considering the discount factor in future rounds.\n\nLet's consider a scenario where I make a counteroffer, which is essentially a walk in round 3 if it is not accepted.\nI have a total of 5 item 1s, 4 item 2s, 2 item 3s, 6 item 4s, and 2 item 5s to distribute.\nThe total value of all items to me is (5*70) + (4*86) + (2*72) + (6*86) + (2*47) = 350 + 344 + 144 + 516 + 94 = 1448.\nIf I demand to keep everything, then my counteroffer to player 1 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which gives me the full value of 1448.\nHowever, they may just walk in response.\nWhat if I try to even split them, but offer a little more of what I like less. The total amounts are (5, 4, 2, 6, 2). The midpoints are then (2.5, 2, 1, 3, 1).\nSince the amounts must be integers, the counteroffer would be something like [2, 2, 1, 3, 1].\n\nIf I counteroffer with [2, 2, 1, 3, 1], then I would keep 3 item 1, 2 item 2, 1 item 3, 3 item 4, and 1 item 5.\nThe value is: (3 * 70) + (2 * 86) + (1 * 72) + (3 * 86) + (1 * 47) = 210 + 172 + 72 + 258 + 47 = 759\n\nInstead, if I try to counteroffer something that gives me a better value, and offer the other player less of items that are more valuable to me. Let's try the counteroffer of [4, 3, 2, 5, 2]\nThen, the amount that I get is: [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]. So the total value to me is: (1*70) + (1*86) + (0*72) + (1*86) + (0*47) = 70 + 86 + 0 + 86 + 0 = 242\n\nThe original offer gave me a value of 759. With the discount rate in the next round, it would be 759 * 0.9 = 683.1\nIf I counteroffer with [2, 1, 0, 2, 0], then I keep 3 item 1, 3 item 2, 2 item 3, 4 item 4, and 2 item 5.\nThe value is: (3*70) + (3*86) + (2*72) + (4*86) + (2*47) = 210 + 258 + 144 + 344 + 94 = 1050\n\nIf I counteroffer with [2, 1, 0, 2, 0], giving me a total value of 1050, then this could be a good decision.\n\nLet's try to improve the offer further to [2, 1, 0, 1, 0]. Then I keep 3 item 1, 3 item 2, 2 item 3, 5 item 4, and 2 item 5.\nThe value is: (3*70) + (3*86) + (2*72) + (5*86) + (2*47) = 210 + 258 + 144 + 430 + 94 = 1136.\nMy outside offer is 382, so I need to make sure that I am getting more than that.\n\nThe current offer's value of 759 is better than my outside option right now. And it could still be better than the value I'd get in the next round with the best counter offer and the discount factor.\n\nSo I think the best option is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This means I keep [4, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\nMy value for keeping [4, 1, 1, 2, 2] is:\n* Item 1: 4 * 93 = 372\n* Item 2: 1 * 9 = 9\n* Item 3: 1 * 26 = 26\n* Item 4: 2 * 82 = 164\n* Item 5: 2 * 60 = 120\nTotal value = 372 + 9 + 26 + 164 + 120 = 691.\n\nSince 691 < 785, this will not do. I need to offer player 1 less to meet my outside offer value. Let me offer player 1 the minimum of items 2, 3, and 5 and see if I can get away with that.\nI will keep 8 item 1, 1 item 2, 1 item 3, 4 item 4, and 4 item 5.\nMy value is then\n* Item 1: 8 * 93 = 744\n* Item 2: 1 * 9 = 9\n* Item 3: 1 * 26 = 26\n* Item 4: 4 * 82 = 328\n* Item 5: 4 * 60 = 240\nMy total value = 744 + 9 + 26 + 328 + 240 = 1347\nSo, I should offer player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThis means I keep everything and give the other player nothing.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer gives me nothing: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would get:\n- 8 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 4 units of item 4\n- 4 units of item 5\n\nThis has a total value to me of:\n(8 * 14) + (1 * 15) + (1 * 90) + (4 * 64) + (4 * 28) = 112 + 15 + 90 + 256 + 112 = 585\n\nSince it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. Therefore, the present value of accepting the current offer is 585 * 0.9 = 526.5. My outside offer is 200. Accepting the current offer is much better than walking away.\n\nHowever, before I accept, let's consider making a counteroffer that might improve my position even further. In round 1, I offered [4, 0, 0, 2, 2]. Player 2 responded with [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This suggests Player 2 highly values items 1, 4, and 5. Given that I value item 3 much more than they appear to, I could try to trade items 1, 4 and 5 for item 3. Let me try to make a counteroffer where I keep item 3 for myself and give all other items to Player 2.\n\nMy counteroffer would be: [8, 1, 0, 4, 4]. This means I keep:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nThis has a total value to me of:\n(0 * 14) + (0 * 15) + (1 * 90) + (0 * 64) + (0 * 28) = 90\nThe present value would be 90 * 0.9 = 81\n\nThis is significantly worse than walking away (value 200). It's also worse than accepting the current offer (value 526.5).\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let's make a slight concession from my previous offer, giving the other player more to incentivise them to accept. I'll increase my offer of item 1 by 1, and my offer of item 4 and 5 by 1 each, to [5, 0, 0, 3, 3]. This means I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis has a total value to me of:\n(3 * 14) + (1 * 15) + (1 * 90) + (1 * 64) + (1 * 28) = 42 + 15 + 90 + 64 + 28 = 239\nThe present value would be 239 * 0.9 = 215.1\n\nThis is better than walking away, but much worse than accepting.\n\nGiven the time discount, and the fact the player 2 gave me nothing in response to my initial offer, it's best for me to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Let's consider making a counteroffer where I keep most of the high-value items (4 and 5) and give Player 1 most of the low-value items (1, 2, and 3).\n\nLet's start by offering Player 1: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.

Since I am giving away all of items 1, 2 and 3, it is always going to be the case that the amount I get is smaller than my outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 786. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 765 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nMy values for the items are:\nItem 1: 57\nItem 2: 36\nItem 3: 58\nItem 4: 97\nItem 5: 7\n\nAvailable quantities are:\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 4\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 6\nItem 5: 6\n\nMy outside offer is 786.\n\nSince I'm the first player, I need to make an initial offer. A reasonable strategy is to offer a split that gives me slightly more than my outside offer, anticipating that the other player will also want to maximize their value. Let's aim for a total value of around 800 after the discount factor. This means targeting roughly 800/0.9 = 888.89 value in round 1.\n\nTo achieve this, I can start by offering Player 2 a relatively even split initially, and adjust based on their reaction.\n\nLet's calculate the value if I offer Player 2 half of each item, rounded down where necessary:\nItem 1: 1 unit to Player 2, I keep 2.  My value: 2 * 57 = 114\nItem 2: 2 units to Player 2, I keep 2.  My value: 2 * 36 = 72\nItem 3: 2 units to Player 2, I keep 2.  My value: 2 * 58 = 116\nItem 4: 3 units to Player 2, I keep 3.  My value: 3 * 97 = 291\nItem 5: 3 units to Player 2, I keep 3.  My value: 3 * 7 = 21\nTotal value to me: 114 + 72 + 116 + 291 + 21 = 614\n\nThis is far below my outside offer. Let's try an offer that skews more in my favor:\n\nItem 1: Offer 1 to Player 2, keep 2. Value: 2 * 57 = 114\nItem 2: Offer 1 to Player 2, keep 3. Value: 3 * 36 = 108\nItem 3: Offer 1 to Player 2, keep 3. Value: 3 * 58 = 174\nItem 4: Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 4. Value: 4 * 97 = 388\nItem 5: Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 4. Value: 4 * 7 = 28\n\nTotal value to me: 114 + 108 + 174 + 388 + 28 = 812\n\nThis is closer. Since it's the first round, I will try to get closer to my value.\n\nItem 1: Offer 1 to Player 2, keep 2. Value: 2 * 57 = 114\nItem 2: Offer 0 to Player 2, keep 4. Value: 4 * 36 = 144\nItem 3: Offer 1 to Player 2, keep 3. Value: 3 * 58 = 174\nItem 4: Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 4. Value: 4 * 97 = 388\nItem 5: Offer 3 to Player 2, keep 3. Value: 3 * 7 = 21\n\nTotal value to me: 114 + 144 + 174 + 388 + 21 = 841\n\nThis offer seems reasonable as an opening bid, exceeding my outside offer even after a discount.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 2, 3]}\n```",

I have 6 units of item 4 in total. I am being offered 5 units, and the total number of units available is 6. The previous offer from Player 1 was [1, 0, 1, 2, 3] - which they didn't like.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I give them almost all the item 4 but keep the rest of the valuable items for myself.

I'll try to improve the chance of acceptance by offering a bit more item 4. How about I offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]. Then I keep 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 6 units of item 5. The value of this outcome to me is:\n(3 * 57) + (4 * 36) + (4 * 58) + (1 * 97) + (6 * 7) = 171 + 144 + 232 + 97 + 42 = 686.\nDiscounted value = 686 * 0.9 = 617.4.

Since I don't know Player 2's values, I need to make a reasonable guess about what they might want. A common approach in such situations is to aim for an equal split of the perceived value. However, since I don't know their values, I should start with an offer that is slightly favorable to me.\n\nLet's consider a split where I keep a little more than half the \"value\". I will initially offer Player 2 half of each item. In cases where there's an odd number of units, I will give them the extra unit. So, the offer will be:\n\nItem 1: 2 units\nItem 2: 3 units\nItem 3: 2 units\nItem 4: 3 units\nItem 5: 3 units\n\nNow, calculate the value of what I keep:\n\nItem 1: 2 units * 68 = 136\nItem 2: 2 units * 63 = 126\nItem 3: 1 units * 77 = 77\nItem 4: 3 units * 21 = 63\nItem 5: 3 units * 83 = 249\nTotal value = 136 + 126 + 77 + 63 + 249 = 651\n\nThis is much lower than my outside offer of 1296, so that's not a good opening offer.\n\nLet's calculate the total value of all items to me:\n(4 * 68) + (5 * 63) + (3 * 77) + (6 * 21) + (6 * 83) = 272 + 315 + 231 + 126 + 498 = 1442\n\nTo get at least close to my outside option I need to get a bit more. \n\nLet me offer only small amounts of the things I value most to the other player and larger amounts of things I value less.\n\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 2 units\nItem 3: 1 unit\nItem 4: 4 units\nItem 5: 2 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 3 units * 68 = 204\nItem 2: 3 units * 63 = 189\nItem 3: 2 units * 77 = 154\nItem 4: 2 units * 21 = 42\nItem 5: 4 units * 83 = 332\nTotal: 204 + 189 + 154 + 42 + 332 = 921\n\nStill below my walkaway value of 1296. Let's adjust again, giving them less overall.\n\nItem 1: 0 units\nItem 2: 1 unit\nItem 3: 0 units\nItem 4: 2 units\nItem 5: 1 unit\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 4 units * 68 = 272\nItem 2: 4 units * 63 = 252\nItem 3: 3 units * 77 = 231\nItem 4: 4 units * 21 = 84\nItem 5: 5 units * 83 = 415\nTotal: 272 + 252 + 231 + 84 + 415 = 1254\n\nClose, but still below. Let's try a final adjustment.\n\nItem 1: 0 units\nItem 2: 0 unit\nItem 3: 0 units\nItem 4: 1 units\nItem 5: 0 unit\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 4 units * 68 = 272\nItem 2: 5 units * 63 = 315\nItem 3: 3 units * 77 = 231\nItem 4: 5 units * 21 = 105\nItem 5: 6 units * 83 = 498\nTotal: 272 + 315 + 231 + 105 + 498 = 1421\n\nThat is the best I can do, and offer just a bit of item 4, as I don't value it much.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Since 585.9 < 1296, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. Since it's round 2, I need to make a counteroffer that is potentially acceptable to Player 2. I want to maximize my value while ensuring Player 2 gets at least their outside option, discounted. I don't know Player 2's values, but I know they previously offered me [2, 2, 1, 3, 3], meaning they likely value the remaining items.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2 everything they already have in their current allocation and giving them some more of the items I value less. Currently, Player 2 has [2, 3, 2, 3, 3]. I have [2, 2, 1, 3, 3]. My values are 68, 63, 77, 21, 83. I need to end up with a higher value than 1296 after discounting in round 2. This means my value needs to be higher than 1296/0.9 = 1440\n\nLet's see if I can reach my target value of 1440 by taking all of item 3, and 5: (3*77+6*83 = 231 + 498 = 729).\nThen with items 1, 2 and 4, I have (4*68 + 5*63 + 6*21) = 272 + 315 + 126 = 713\nTotal 713 + 729 = 1442. This might be close to optimal.\nI can't give more items.\n\nSo I want to make a counteroffer such that I have all units of items 3 and 5 and player 2 has all the rest. My counteroffer to Player 2 would be [4, 5, 0, 6, 0]. I will keep everything else.\n\nValue to me:\n231 + 498 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1442.\nValue discounted: 1442 * 0.9 = 1297.8\nI should go with this, because 1297.8 is more than 1296\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 5, 0, 6, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

My goal is to maximize my discounted value, considering my private values for each item and my outside offer of 331.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 18 (3 units available)\n- Item 2: 98 (2 units available)\n- Item 3: 66 (2 units available)\n- Item 4: 42 (2 units available)\n- Item 5: 32 (3 units available)\n\nTotal value of all items to me: (3 * 18) + (2 * 98) + (2 * 66) + (2 * 42) + (3 * 32) = 54 + 196 + 132 + 84 + 96 = 562\n\nSince I'm going first, I need to make an initial offer to Player 2. I want to make an offer that is attractive enough for Player 2 to accept, but also leaves me with a good portion of the items. A good starting point might be to offer Player 2 slightly more than half of the total value of all items. However, it's important to consider that Player 2's preferences might be different from mine. Therefore, an offer that is close to equal in terms of *my* valuation might look very different from an offer that is close to equal in terms of *their* valuation.\n\nGiven my outside option is 331, I need to ensure the offer I accept in any round gives me at least that value.\n\nLet's start by making an offer that is reasonably generous to Player 2, hoping they will accept quickly.\nI will offer Player 2:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (value 18)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (value 98)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (value 66)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (value 42)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (value 32)\n\nMy total value from this is 18 + 98 + 66 + 42 + 32 = 256. This is less than my outside option, which is not good. Let's try another offer which gives me at least my outside option value (331):\n- 1 units of item 1\n- 0 unit of item 2\n- 0 unit of item 3\n- 0 unit of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- 2 unit of item 1 (value 36)\n- 2 unit of item 2 (value 196)\n- 2 unit of item 3 (value 132)\n- 2 unit of item 4 (value 84)\n- 3 unit of item 5 (value 96)\n\nMy total value from this is 36 + 196 + 132 + 84 + 96 = 544. I am offering Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 2 unit of item 2\n- 2 unit of item 3\n- 2 unit of item 4\n- 3 unit of item 5\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 1, and there's no offer on the table. I need to make an initial offer to Player 2. My goal is to maximize my discounted value, considering my outside offer of 324 and the discount factor of 0.9.\n\nMy values for the items are:\n- Item 1: 43 (3 units available)\n- Item 2: 9 (6 units available)\n- Item 3: 12 (2 units available)\n- Item 4: 3 (2 units available)\n- Item 5: 85 (3 units available)\n\nI need to consider what would be a reasonable offer to make to Player 2 to entice them into accepting a deal. I need to keep enough of the high-value items (item 1 and item 5) to exceed my outside offer, while also giving Player 2 enough to accept.\n\nLet's start by considering an even split for all items. That means offering the following to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 3 units\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 2 units (2 * 43 = 86)\n- Item 2: 3 units (3 * 9 = 27)\n- Item 3: 1 unit (1 * 12 = 12)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (1 * 3 = 3)\n- Item 5: 2 units (2 * 85 = 170)\nTotal Value to me: 86 + 27 + 12 + 3 + 170 = 298\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 324.\n\nLet's try offering the following to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 0 unit\n- Item 2: 3 units\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 0 unit\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 3 units (3 * 43 = 129)\n- Item 2: 3 units (3 * 9 = 27)\n- Item 3: 1 unit (1 * 12 = 12)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (1 * 3 = 3)\n- Item 5: 3 units (3 * 85 = 255)\nTotal Value to me: 129 + 27 + 12 + 3 + 255 = 426\n\nThis is significantly more than my outside offer. The discounted value is 426 * 0.9^(1-1) = 426.\n\nLet's see what it would cost me to improve my offer, while still being above my outside offer, to make it more appealing to player 2. Let's offer player 2 one unit of item 5.\n- Item 1: 0 unit\n- Item 2: 3 units\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 3 units (3 * 43 = 129)\n- Item 2: 3 units (3 * 9 = 27)\n- Item 3: 1 unit (1 * 12 = 12)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (1 * 3 = 3)\n- Item 5: 2 units (2 * 85 = 170)\nTotal Value to me: 129 + 27 + 12 + 3 + 170 = 341\n\nThis is still above my outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I am Player 1 and I want to maximize my value, considering my private values for the items and my outside offer. I need to make an initial offer to Player 2. Since I don't know Player 2's values, I need to make a reasonable offer that gives them enough to accept, but also leaves me with a good value. I also need to keep in mind my outside offer of 444.\n\nI'll aim for a roughly even split of the total possible value if both players valued everything at 50, then adjust based on the values of my items. Total units are 4+5+7+3+5 = 24. Assuming a median value of 50, total possible value would be 24*50 = 1200. Splitting evenly would give each player 600. My values are generally below 50 except for items 1, 2, and 4, so giving player 2 slightly more of 3 and 5 would be a good strategy.\nI can give Player 2 slightly more than half of items 3 and 5, and slightly less of items 1, 2 and 4.\n\nLet's propose giving Player 2 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\n\nThat means I would retain:\n2 units of item 1 = 2 * 33 = 66\n2 units of item 2 = 2 * 51 = 102\n3 units of item 3 = 3 * 10 = 30\n2 units of item 4 = 2 * 61 = 122\n2 units of item 5 = 2 * 43 = 86\nTotal value for me: 66 + 102 + 30 + 122 + 86 = 406\n\nGiving Player 2:\n2 units of item 1 = 2 * 33 = 66\n3 units of item 2 = 3 * 51 = 153\n4 units of item 3 = 4 * 10 = 40\n1 units of item 4 = 1 * 61 = 61\n3 units of item 5 = 3 * 43 = 129\nTotal value (to me): 66 + 153 + 40 + 61 + 129 = 449\n\nThis offer gives me 406 if accepted, which is close to my outside offer. The offer to player 2 is also close, but a little bit less than my outside offer, so it might be rejected.\nTo make it more enticing, I can give player 2 one more of item 3.\n\nLet's propose giving Player 2 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\n\nThat means I would retain:\n2 units of item 1 = 2 * 33 = 66\n2 units of item 2 = 2 * 51 = 102\n2 units of item 3 = 2 * 10 = 20\n2 units of item 4 = 2 * 61 = 122\n2 units of item 5 = 2 * 43 = 86\nTotal value for me: 66 + 102 + 20 + 122 + 86 = 396\n\nGiving Player 2:\n2 units of item 1 = 2 * 33 = 66\n3 units of item 2 = 3 * 51 = 153\n5 units of item 3 = 5 * 10 = 50\n1 units of item 4 = 1 * 61 = 61\n3 units of item 5 = 3 * 43 = 129\nTotal value (to me): 66 + 153 + 50 + 61 + 129 = 459\n\nThe total value to me is now 396.

To decide this, I'll consider what a reasonable counteroffer might be, and whether making it is better than walking away.\nA reasonable split would be something close to an even split of the total value. The total value is (3 * 55) + (2 * 55) + (6 * 36) + (7 * 100) + (1 * 22) = 165 + 110 + 216 + 700 + 22 = 1213.\nHalf of that is 606.5.\nLet's consider offering player 2 close to half of each item's value, adjusted for the available amounts.\nI have 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 7 of item 4, 1 of item 5.\nLet's aim to give the other player slightly less than half of my total valuation of 1213.\nMy outside option is 398. Let's aim for a deal value of around 650 for me, which is comfortably above my outside option. That means Player 2 gets about 1213 - 650 = 563. I'll start by seeing what a more generous offer would look like, and if I can afford it.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 half the items as a starting point, rounding up where necessary since we can only offer whole units.\nOffer: [2, 1, 3, 4, 1].\nValue to Player 2: (2 * their value for item 1) + (1 * their value for item 2) + (3 * their value for item 3) + (4 * their value for item 4) + (1 * their value for item 5)\nValue to me: (1 * 55) + (1 * 55) + (3 * 36) + (3 * 100) + (0 * 22) = 55 + 55 + 108 + 300 + 0 = 518.\nThis is better than my outside offer of 398, but not great.\n\nLet's consider giving them a little less.\nOffer: [1, 1, 3, 3, 0].\nValue to me: (2 * 55) + (1 * 55) + (3 * 36) + (4 * 100) + (1 * 22) = 110 + 55 + 108 + 400 + 22 = 695\nIf I discount that by 0.9, I get 625.5.\nThis is pretty good!\n\nSo I'll make the offer [1, 1, 3, 3, 0] again.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 3, 0]}\n```",

Therefore, accepting would be a bad idea. I must decide between walking away and making a counteroffer.

The minimal amount would be giving them every item and keeping none for myself [3, 2, 6, 7, 1].

This is not optimal since the outside option is 1199.\n\nIt is difficult to find an appropriate counteroffer without Player 1's valuation of items.

A completely even split is likely not optimal because my values for the items are different.

My outside offer is 1104.\n\nIn round 1, I offered Player 2 [1, 1, 0, 1, 4], and Player 2 offered me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This suggests Player 2 is trying to get everything.\n\nIf I accept the current offer, I get 0, which is far worse than my outside offer of 1104. Walking away gives me 1104.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to consider the discount factor of 0.9. Any deal I make now will be multiplied by 0.9. To beat my outside option, the value of the deal to me needs to be greater than 1104 / 0.9 = 1226.67.\n\nLet's evaluate the initial offer I made in round 1 and see how it compares to my outside option.\nIf I offered player 2 [1, 1, 0, 1, 4], that means I would retain:\n* Item 1: 6 - 1 = 5 units. Value: 5 * 47 = 235\n* Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units. Value: 3 * 94 = 282\n* Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1 unit. Value: 1 * 38 = 38\n* Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4 units. Value: 4 * 41 = 164\n* Item 5: 10 - 4 = 6 units. Value: 6 * 77 = 462\nTotal value to me: 235 + 282 + 38 + 164 + 462 = 1181\n\nSince 1181 * 0.9 = 1062.9 < 1104, this offer is not good enough at round 2.\n\nSince Player 2 offered me zero in round 1, it seems unlikely that we will come to an agreement. I'll try to make an offer that is slightly more generous than my outside offer.\n\nIf I want a final value after the discount of 1104 I need an initial round value of 1226.67. Let's try to make a more reasonable offer.\nSince my total value is 1671, that means Player 2 needs to be assigned items worth at least x such that 1671-x = 1226.67 => x=444.33.\n\nLet me give Player 2:\nitem 1: 1\nitem 2: 1\nitem 3: 1\nitem 4: 1\nitem 5: 3\n\nMy Value would then be:\nItem 1: 5 * 47 = 235\nItem 2: 3 * 94 = 282\nItem 3: 0 * 38 = 0\nItem 4: 4 * 41 = 164\nItem 5: 7 * 77 = 539\n\n235 + 282 + 0 + 164 + 539 = 1220\n\n1220 * 0.9 = 1098 < 1104\nLet me give Player 2:\nitem 1: 1\nitem 2: 0\nitem 3: 0\nitem 4: 0\nitem 5: 3\n\nMy Value would then be:\nItem 1: 5 * 47 = 235\nItem 2: 4 * 94 = 376\nItem 3: 1 * 38 = 38\nItem 4: 5 * 41 = 205\nItem 5: 7 * 77 = 539\n\n235+376+38+205+539 = 1393\n1393 * 0.9 = 1253.7 > 1104.\n\nPlayer 2 receives: 47 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 * v5 = 47 + 3*v5\n\nPlayer 2s Max Value is: 47 + 3*101 = 350\nMy final value = 1253.7 > 1104\nLet's see if a better offer can be made.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 3]}\n",

It seems as though they value Item 1 and Item 5.\n\nGiven that this is round 2, and there is one round left, a more aggressive counteroffer might be appropriate.

This would leave me with:\n- Item 1: 4\n- Item 2: 4\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 3\n\nMy value would then be:\n(4 * 8) + (4 * 99) + (1 * 50) + (4 * 60) + (3 * 61) = 32 + 396 + 50 + 240 + 183 = 901\nDiscounted value: 901 * 0.9 = 810.9\n\nLet's see what value Player 1 gets under this new offer. They get [2, 4, 1, 1, 7]. We don't know their values so it is difficult to anticipate what they will do.\nAnother option is to make a small change to Player 1's original offer in round 1.

A naive approach would be to offer half of each item, if possible.

I need to make a counteroffer.\n\nI have the following items:\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 7 units\n* Item 3: 5 units\n* Item 4: 0 units\n* Item 5: 1 unit\n\nPlayer 1 offered [0, 3, 2, 0, 0] in round 1, meaning they kept [1, 4, 3, 0, 1].\nPlayer 2 offered [1, 3, 2, 0, 1], meaning they would keep [0, 4, 3, 0, 0].\n\nLet's aim for a split that's more favorable to me, but still potentially acceptable to Player 2. How about offering them half of my resources (rounding up where necessary to be a valid offer) and hoping they accept?\n\n* Item 1: 1/2 -> 1 unit (rounding up since I have only 1 item of this type)\n* Item 2: 7/2 -> 4 units\n* Item 3: 5/2 -> 3 units\n* Item 4: 0/2 -> 0 units\n* Item 5: 1/2 -> 1 unit\n\nThis counteroffer would be [1, 4, 3, 0, 1].\n\nIf Player 2 accepts this in round 2, my value would be:\n* Item 1: 0 * 13 = 0\n* Item 2: 3 * 44 = 132\n* Item 3: 2 * 17 = 34\n* Item 4: 0 * 36 = 0\n* Item 5: 0 * 66 = 0\nTotal value = 0 + 132 + 34 + 0 + 0 = 166\n\nDiscounted Value in round 2 (r=2): 166 * 0.9 = 149.4. This is still less than 352.\n\nLet's try something else. I need to get more value out of this. How about I offer only what they asked for?\n* Item 1: 1\n* Item 2: 3\n* Item 3: 2\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 1\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 3, 2, 0, 1]\n\nMy Value of this offer (what I keep):\n* Item 1: 0 * 13 = 0\n* Item 2: 4 * 44 = 176\n* Item 3: 3 * 17 = 51\n* Item 4: 0 * 36 = 0\n* Item 5: 0 * 66 = 0\nTotal Value = 0 + 176 + 51 + 0 + 0 = 227\nDiscounted Value: 227 * 0.9 = 204.3\nThis is still below my outside option.\n\nI need to be more aggressive. If I want a better deal than my outside option I need to keep a lot.\nLet's try an offer close to their original offer but slightly more in my favor: [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]\nThis means I will get: \n* Item 1: 1 * 13 = 13\n* Item 2: 5 * 44 = 220\n* Item 3: 4 * 17 = 68\n* Item 4: 0 * 36 = 0\n* Item 5: 1 * 66 = 66\n\nTotal = 13 + 220 + 68 + 0 + 66 = 367. Discounted = 367 * 0.9 = 330.3\nStill below my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering nothing at all.\nOffer = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThen I keep all the resources myself:\nMy value is 13 + (7 * 44) + (5 * 17) + (0 * 36) + 66 = 13 + 308 + 85 + 0 + 66 = 472\nDiscounted value = 472 * 0.9 = 424.8\nThis is better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1050. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 999 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best course of action.

Since the current offer (465) is significantly less than my outside offer (1050), accepting it would be a bad decision.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I have the following items:\n\n*   Item 1: 4 units\n*   Item 2: 3 units\n*   Item 3: 5 units\n*   Item 4: 2 units\n*   Item 5: 7 units\n\nTo determine a reasonable counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 1 might value these items at. Since I don't know their values, I'll aim for a division that gives me at least my outside offer value, assuming Player 1 wants at least a comparable amount. I will consider the maximum amount Player 1 could value the items (101).\nWith my total value of 1523, I can consider making an offer that gets me closer to that value. I need 1050 / .9 = 1166 to meet my outside option if I need to walk next round. Since this is the first round, I should propose something more favorable to me.\n\nI will propose giving Player 1:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 0\nItem 4: 0\nItem 5: 0\nThis gives me a total of 4*78 + 3*92 + 5*43 + 2*24 + 7*96 = 312 + 276 + 215 + 48 + 672 = 1523.

My goal is to maximize my discounted value, considering my outside offer of 974 and the discount factor of 0.9.\n\nSince I have no information about Player 2's values or outside offer, I will aim for a relatively even split initially, favoring myself slightly to test the waters. This also allows for some room to concede in later rounds if needed. I will allocate slightly less than half of each item to Player 2.\n\nHere's the calculation for the offer:\n\n*   Item 1: Give Player 2 0 unit (keep 2)\n*   Item 2: Give Player 2 5 units (keep 6)\n*   Item 3: Give Player 2 1 unit (keep 2)\n*   Item 4: Give Player 2 2 units (keep 4)\n*   Item 5: Give Player 2 1 unit (keep 2)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value this gives me:\n*   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 14 = 28\n*   6 units of item 2 = 6 * 93 = 558\n*   2 units of item 3 = 2 * 17 = 34\n*   4 units of item 4 = 4 * 51 = 204\n*   2 units of item 5 = 2 * 69 = 138\nTotal value for me = 28 + 558 + 34 + 204 + 138 = 962\n\nThis is slightly below my outside option of 974, but it's only round 1, and this is without the discount factor. So, discounted it's not worth it.\n\nLet's try to calculate the values for slightly different offer:\n*   Item 1: Give Player 2 0 unit (keep 2)\n*   Item 2: Give Player 2 4 units (keep 7)\n*   Item 3: Give Player 2 1 unit (keep 2)\n*   Item 4: Give Player 2 2 units (keep 4)\n*   Item 5: Give Player 2 1 unit (keep 2)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value this gives me:\n*   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 14 = 28\n*   7 units of item 2 = 7 * 93 = 651\n*   2 units of item 3 = 2 * 17 = 34\n*   4 units of item 4 = 4 * 51 = 204\n*   2 units of item 5 = 2 * 69 = 138\nTotal value for me = 28 + 651 + 34 + 204 + 138 = 1055\nDiscounted Value = 1055 * 0.9^(1-1) = 1055\n\nThis is better.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and decide on the best course of action.\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 is [0, 4, 1, 2, 1]. This means they are offering me:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy values for each item are:\n- Item 1: 72\n- Item 2: 100\n- Item 3: 91\n- Item 4: 64\n- Item 5: 75\n\nSo, the value of this offer to me is:\n(0 * 72) + (4 * 100) + (1 * 91) + (2 * 64) + (1 * 75) = 0 + 400 + 91 + 128 + 75 = 694\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. Therefore, the present value of this offer is 694 * 1 = 694.\n\nMy outside offer is 1769.  Since 694 < 1769, accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away.\n\nNow, I need to consider making a counteroffer. My goal is to get an offer that's worth more than 1769 * 0.9^(number of rounds -1), taking into account the discount factor in future rounds, while considering the total number of items available.\nSince it's Round 1, the discounted outside offer is 1769.\n\nLet's calculate the total value of all items to me:\n(2 * 72) + (11 * 100) + (3 * 91) + (6 * 64) + (3 * 75) = 144 + 1100 + 273 + 384 + 225 = 2126\n\nI will make a counteroffer that aims to get me at least 1769. Since I need to give Player 1 something to incentivize them to accept, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable division than just my outside offer. The offer to Player 1 should leave me with at least 1769. The total amount of all items is 2 of item 1, 11 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 6 of item 4 and 3 of item 5.\n\nI will try offering Player 1: [1, 6, 1, 3, 1].\nThis leaves me with [1, 5, 2, 3, 2]\nMy value for this would be:\n(1*72) + (5*100) + (2*91) + (3*64) + (2*75) = 72 + 500 + 182 + 192 + 150 = 1096\n\nThis counteroffer isn't very good for me as the value is far less than my outside offer, therefore I will adjust the counteroffer. I want to aim for close to 1769 or higher for myself.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0].\nThis leaves me with [2, 10, 3, 5, 3]\nMy value would be:\n(2*72) + (10*100) + (3*91) + (5*64) + (3*75) = 144 + 1000 + 273 + 320 + 225 = 1962\n\nThe offer for Player 1: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n(0*V1) + (1*V2) + (0*V3) + (1*V4) + (0*V5)\n\nThis offer leaves me with 1962 which is higher than my walkaway.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Let's consider making an offer that gives Player 2 roughly half the value of the total items. To do this properly, I would need to estimate Player 2's values, but I don't have that information.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1203. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1008 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 0, 1, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 0, 1, 1] units of items 1 through 5, respectively. My values for these items are 88, 24, 93, 59, and 72, respectively. I have 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 8 units of item 5 in total. My outside offer is worth 1203. The discount factor is 0.9, so outcomes in this round are multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n2 * 88 + 1 * 24 + 0 * 93 + 1 * 59 + 1 * 72 = 176 + 24 + 0 + 59 + 72 = 331.\nSince this is in round 2, we multiply this value by the discount factor 0.9:\n331 * 0.9 = 297.9.\nSince 297.9 is significantly less than my outside offer of 1203, accepting is not a good option.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. To make a good counteroffer, I should try to get as much of the items I value highly (items 1, 3, and 5) as possible, while giving Player 1 items that I value less.\nMy current holdings are:\nItem 1: 6 - 2 = 4 units\nItem 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\nItem 3: 0 - 0 = 0 units\nItem 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units\nItem 5: 8 - 1 = 7 units\n\nI want to make a counteroffer that is better than 1203/0.9 = 1336.67.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 the minimum they offered in the previous round [3, 1, 0, 1, 4]. This means I would keep:\nItem 1: 6 - 3 = 3 units\nItem 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\nItem 3: 0 - 0 = 0 units\nItem 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units\nItem 5: 8 - 4 = 4 units\n\nMy value for this would be:\n3 * 88 + 2 * 24 + 0 * 93 + 2 * 59 + 4 * 72 = 264 + 48 + 0 + 118 + 288 = 718\nThis * 0.9 is not greater than 1203, so this will not work.\n\nLet's try giving away all of item 2 and item 4 since they are my lowest valued. And give one less of Item 5.\nOffer: [0, 3, 0, 3, 7]\nThis will give me:\nItem 1: 6\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 0\nItem 4: 0\nItem 5: 1\n\nValue: 6 * 88 + 0 * 24 + 0 * 93 + 0 * 59 + 1 * 72 = 528 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 72 = 600\nAgain, this is too low as 600 * 0.9 < 1203\n\nLet me attempt to make a reasonable offer such that I get greater than the outside option:\nLet's aim for a value around 1400:\nI want to hold onto as much item 1, 3, and 5 as I can.\n\nOffer: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nItem 1: 5\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 0\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 7\nValue = 5 * 88 + 2 * 24 + 0 * 93 + 2 * 59 + 7 * 72 = 440 + 48 + 0 + 118 + 504 = 1110\n1110 * 0.9 = 999 which is less than 1203, so I will not do this.\n\nI will take my outside offer and WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

However, this is only round 1, and I could potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n\nTo decide on a counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 1 might value and what my values are.  Since I don't know Player 1's values, I'll aim for a split that's more favorable to me but still potentially acceptable to them. I'll focus on giving them more of the items I value less, and keeping more of the items I value more.\n\nHere's my current inventory:\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 9 units\n- Item 4: 4 units\n- Item 5: 6 units\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n- Item 1: 0\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 4\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 3\n\nSo the offer implies Player 1 has:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 5\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 3\n\nI want to shift more value to myself. I value item 2 and item 3 more than item 4 and 5. So, I'll counteroffer with giving Player 1 more of item 4 and item 5, and less of item 2 and item 3.\nLet's try offering Player 1: 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\n\nThis means I would get:\n- Item 1: 0 units (value 40) = 0\n- Item 2: 1 unit (value 83) = 83\n- Item 3: 3 units (value 60) = 180\n- Item 4: 1 units (value 23) = 23\n- Item 5: 2 units (value 51) = 102\n\nTotal value to me: 0 + 83 + 180 + 23 + 102 = 388\n\nThis is less than the initial offer of 522. Let's try a different counteroffer:\nGive Player 1: 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\n\nThis means I would get:\n- Item 1: 1 unit (value 40) = 40\n- Item 2: 2 unit (value 83) = 166\n- Item 3: 4 units (value 60) = 240\n- Item 4: 2 units (value 23) = 46\n- Item 5: 3 units (value 51) = 153\n\nTotal value to me: 40 + 166 + 240 + 46 + 153 = 645\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside option and better than the original offer.

Player 1 (myself) initially offered Player 2 [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] in round 1, and Player 2 responded with an offer of [0, 0, 5, 2, 3]. This means Player 2 is offering me:\n\n*   Item 1: 0 units\n*   Item 2: 0 units\n*   Item 3: 5 units\n*   Item 4: 2 units\n*   Item 5: 3 units\n\nMy values are:\n\n*   Item 1: 57\n*   Item 2: 49\n*   Item 3: 52\n*   Item 4: 91\n*   Item 5: 42\n\nLet's calculate the value of Player 2's offer to me:\n\n*   Item 1: 0 * 57 = 0\n*   Item 2: 0 * 49 = 0\n*   Item 3: 5 * 52 = 260\n*   Item 4: 2 * 91 = 182\n*   Item 5: 3 * 42 = 126\n\nTotal value of the offer = 0 + 0 + 260 + 182 + 126 = 568\n\nNow, we need to discount this value since it's round 2. The discount factor is 0.9, so we multiply the value by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9:\n\nDiscounted value of the offer = 568 * 0.9 = 511.2\n\nMy outside offer is 513. Since the discounted value of Player 2's offer (511.2) is less than my outside offer (513), I should not accept.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. Since it is Round 2, and there is a discount factor, I want to make an offer that is appealing enough to Player 2 that they will accept it, but also gives me more than my outside offer of 513 when discounted. The total available units are:\n\n*   Item 1: 1\n*   Item 2: 2\n*   Item 3: 9\n*   Item 4: 4\n*   Item 5: 6\n\nLet's think about what Player 2 is giving me in their offer: 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5. Player 2 keeps 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. I currently have the outside option of 513.\n\nI want to make an offer that gives me more discounted value than 513. That means I want the offer to give me at least 513/0.9 = 570.\n\nLet's analyze the original offer. Player 1 offers [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] in Round 1. This gives me:\nItem 1: 1 * 57 = 57\nItem 2: 1 * 49 = 49\nItem 3: 5 * 52 = 260\nItem 4: 2 * 91 = 182\nItem 5: 3 * 42 = 126\nTotal: 674. The discounted value is 674 * 0.9 = 606.6\n\nPlayer 2 responded by offering [0, 0, 5, 2, 3]. So perhaps Player 2 really values item 2. So lets give them less item 2 in the counteroffer. I will try to get more item 4 since I value it a lot. I will propose [0, 1, 4, 1, 3]\nPlayer 2 gets: 0 item 1, 1 item 2, 4 item 3, 1 item 4, 3 item 5\nI get: 1 item 1, 1 item 2, 5 item 3, 3 item 4, 3 item 5\nThis offer gives me: 1 * 57 + 1 * 49 + 5 * 52 + 3 * 91 + 3 * 42 = 57 + 49 + 260 + 273 + 126 = 765\nThe discounted value is 765 * 0.9 = 688.5 > 513\nI have to check if this is something that Player 2 would prefer, since they counter offered to give me [0, 0, 5, 2, 3],\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 4, 1, 3]}\n",

Value = 2 * 21 = 42\n*   Total value = 76 + 123 + 74 + 61 + 42 = 376\n\nThis is significantly lower than my outside offer of 621. So, I need to offer less to Player 2. I want to find an offer to Player 2 such that what I keep is worth at least my outside offer of 621. Let's start by offering player 2 almost nothing.\n*   Item 1: I give 0, I keep 4. Value = 4 * 38 = 152\n*   Item 2: I give 0, I keep 6. Value = 6 * 41 = 246\n*   Item 3: I give 0, I keep 4. Value = 4 * 37 = 148\n*   Item 4: I give 0, I keep 2.

My values for the items are 38, 41, 37, 61, and 21, respectively.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of Player 2's offer to me:\n*   2 units of item 1: 2 * 38 = 76\n*   3 units of item 2: 3 * 41 = 123\n*   2 units of item 3: 2 * 37 = 74\n*   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 61 = 61\n*   2 units of item 5: 2 * 21 = 42\nTotal value of Player 2's offer: 76 + 123 + 74 + 61 + 42 = 376\n\nNow I need to consider the discount factor. Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. So the present value of Player 2's offer to me is 376 * 0.9 = 338.4.\n\nMy outside offer is 621. Since 338.4 is less than 621, accepting the offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow I need to decide if I can make a counteroffer that is better than walking away. Since it's round 2, Player 2 will have the final say in Round 3. Therefore, any counteroffer I make has to be good enough to get Player 2 to accept.\n\nI have a total of 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. Player 2's offer leaves me with 2, 3, 2, 1, 2 units of each item respectively.\n\nLet's consider a possible counteroffer. To make it worthwhile for Player 2 to accept, I will offer them only items that I value less and keep items that I value more. The items with the highest values for me are item 4 (61) and item 2 (41) followed by item 1 (38) item 3 (37) and item 5 (21).\n\nI need to leave Player 2 with enough value that they would accept the counteroffer over their outside offer. We don't know Player 2's outside offer. Without knowing Player 2's valuations, I will offer them the items I don't care as much about and keep the valuable ones for myself.\nI will try offering [3, 5, 3, 1, 3]. This means I keep 1 of each item type for myself.\nMy value from this outcome would be:\n1 * 38 + 1 * 41 + 1 * 37 + 1 * 61 + 1 * 21 = 198\nDiscounted value = 198 * 0.9 = 178.2\nThis is worse than my outside option.\n\nGiven the limited information, and the risk that Player 2 will simply walk in the final round, I'm inclined to walk away rather than risk a counteroffer that ultimately fails. My outside option is 621. Accepting would only give me 338.4.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

It's round 2, and I need to decide whether to accept Player 2's offer, walk away, or make a counteroffer.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of Player 2's current offer to me: [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nValue = (0 * 34) + (2 * 69) + (1 * 91) + (1 * 57) + (0 * 80) = 0 + 138 + 91 + 57 + 0 = 286\n\nNow, let's consider the discount factor. Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. So, the present value of accepting Player 2's offer is 286 * 0.9 = 257.4.\n\nThis value (257.4) is less than my outside offer of 619. Therefore, accepting the offer would be a bad idea.\n\nNow, let's consider a potential counteroffer. I need to ensure that my offer is better than walking away (getting 619 value). Since Player 2 offered [0, 2, 1, 1, 0], they would get the remaining items. The available items are 2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 3 of item 5. Let's calculate my value if I take the items offered in round 1, [0, 3, 2, 2, 1].\nValue = (2-0)*34 + (5-3)*69 + (4-2)*91 + (4-2)*57 + (3-1)*80 = 2*34 + 2*69 + 2*91 + 2*57 + 2*80 = 68 + 138 + 182 + 114 + 160 = 662\nWith the discount factor of 0.9, this results in 595.8, which is less than my outside offer of 619.\n\nI will make a counteroffer that secures me the items I value most, while leaving some for Player 2 to make it appealing. I will attempt to capture most of Item 3 and Item 5, of which I have the highest private values.\n\nLet me offer Player 2: [1, 3, 2, 2, 2].  This leaves me with [1, 2, 2, 2, 1].\nValue = (1 * 34) + (2 * 69) + (2 * 91) + (2 * 57) + (1 * 80) = 34 + 138 + 182 + 114 + 80 = 548\nWith the discount factor this yields 548 * 0.9 = 493.2, still less than my outside offer.\n\nInstead, I'm going to try and get a lot more value for myself. Let me try and capture as much value as possible while leaving the items I value less to the other agent.\nLet's try offering the other player this: [2, 5, 4, 4, 3]. In other words, I get nothing! This leaves me with a value of 0.\n\nLet's make an offer that is somewhere in between. My goal is to get an offer that is at least worth my outside offer.\nLet me offer Player 2 [0, 3, 2, 2, 0]. Which corresponds with what I offered in Round 1.\nThat leaves me with: [2, 2, 2, 2, 3] which gives me 2*34 + 2*69 + 2*91 + 2*57 + 3*80 = 68 + 138 + 182 + 114 + 240 = 742. This multiplied by the discount factor of 0.9 equals 667.8. This is much greater than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 2, 2, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy private values are: 61 for item 1, 23 for item 2, 53 for item 3, 30 for item 4, 98 for item 5.\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(0 * 61) + (3 * 23) + (1 * 53) + (0 * 30) + (1 * 98) = 0 + 69 + 53 + 0 + 98 = 220.\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\nTherefore, the present value of accepting this offer is 220 * 1 = 220.\n\nMy outside offer is 542.  Since 220 < 542, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, I need to consider making a counteroffer. I want to find an offer that Player 1 might accept, but that gives me a higher value than my outside offer. Let's see what happens if I give Player 1 everything they originally asked for.\nTheir original offer to me was [0, 3, 1, 0, 1]. This means that Player 1 keeps: 1-0=1 unit of item 1, 6-3=3 units of item 2, 2-1=1 unit of item 3, 0-0=0 units of item 4 and 3-1=2 units of item 5. My values on these are 1*61, 3*23, 1*53, 0*30 and 2*98 or 61 + 69 + 53 + 0 + 196 = 379\n\nTo improve over my outside offer of 542, I need to get at least that much value. Giving Player 1 my \"counteroffer\" of what they were asking for in the first place (giving them 1,3,1,0,2) seems like the best I can do.\n\nI can keep 0 of item 1 (value = 0*61 = 0), 3 of item 2 (value = 3*23 = 69), 1 of item 3 (value = 1*53 = 53), 0 of item 4 (value = 0*30 = 0), and 1 of item 5 (value = 1*98 = 98).\nThen the total value to me = 0 + 69 + 53 + 0 + 98 = 220. Giving them more than this wouldn't be good for me. I need more information about their values to make a strategic counteroffer. Given my outside offer, it is unlikely I can get a good offer.\n\nTherefore, my best option is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

I don't know Player 2's values, so I'll assume they are uniformly distributed between 1 and 101.\n\nI'll aim for an offer that gives me a good portion of the higher-value items (3, 2, and 5) and Player 2 a larger share of items 1 and 2, which have lower values for me. This is just my initial offer, and I can adjust based on Player 2's response.\n\nNow, let's calculate the value to me of keeping specific amounts of each item. My values are: item 1: 31, item 2: 58, item 3: 74, item 4: 3, item 5: 56. Total items: 10, 6, 3, 2, 2. Total value is 31*10 + 58*6 + 74*3 + 3*2 + 56*2 = 310 + 348 + 222 + 6 + 112 = 998. My outside offer is 290.\n\nI will offer Player 2 a significant portion of item 1 and some of item 2, a little of item 3, and almost all of items 4 and 5 to start.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2: 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This means I would keep: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nValue to me:\n4 * 31 + 3 * 58 + 2 * 74 + 1 * 3 + 1 * 56 = 124 + 174 + 148 + 3 + 56 = 505\n\nSince 505 > 290, this is better than walking away right now.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1098. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1095 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's break down this negotiation problem.\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\n*   **My Goal:** Maximize my discounted value, considering my private values, the outside offer, and the negotiation discount.\n*   **Information:** I know my own values, the item quantities, and the negotiation rules. I don't know Player 2's values or outside offer.\n*   **Round 1:** I make the first offer.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 1098. This is my guaranteed minimum value. Any counteroffer I accept (or that leads to a final allocation) must be worth at least this much *after discounting*.\n\n2.  **My Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 36 (4 units available)\n    *   Item 2: 98 (3 units available)\n    *   Item 3: 83 (4 units available)\n    *   Item 4: 93 (3 units available)\n    *   Item 5: 55 (8 units available)\n\n3.  **Strategic Approach:** Since I don't know Player 2's values, I will start with an offer that gives them a reasonable share while still ensuring I get a good deal, significantly above my outside option. A simple approach is to try for an even split. This may not be optimal, but without knowing Player 2's values, it is hard to do much better without running the risk of a walk.\n\n4. **Even split calculation**: I will give Player 2 half of each item (rounding down for odd numbers).\n    * Item 1: 2 units\n    * Item 2: 1 unit\n    * Item 3: 2 units\n    * Item 4: 1 unit\n    * Item 5: 4 units\n\n    Value to Player 2: 2 * 36 + 1 * 98 + 2 * 83 + 1 * 93 + 4 * 55 = 72 + 98 + 166 + 93 + 220 = 649\n\n    My share:\n    * Item 1: 2 units\n    * Item 2: 2 unit\n    * Item 3: 2 units\n    * Item 4: 2 unit\n    * Item 5: 4 units\n\n    Value to me: 2 * 36 + 2 * 98 + 2 * 83 + 2 * 93 + 4 * 55 = 72 + 196 + 166 + 186 + 220 = 840\n    This is much less than my outside option so it's not a good offer.\n\n5. **Alternative offer**: I will offer Player 2 a smaller portion to ensure I get more than my outside option.\n    * Item 1: 1 units\n    * Item 2: 0 unit\n    * Item 3: 1 units\n    * Item 4: 0 unit\n    * Item 5: 3 units\n\n    Value to Player 2: 1 * 36 + 0 * 98 + 1 * 83 + 0 * 93 + 3 * 55 = 36 + 0 + 83 + 0 + 165 = 284\n\n    My share:\n    * Item 1: 3 units\n    * Item 2: 3 unit\n    * Item 3: 3 units\n    * Item 4: 3 unit\n    * Item 5: 5 units\n\n    Value to me: 3 * 36 + 3 * 98 + 3 * 83 + 3 * 93 + 5 * 55 = 108 + 294 + 249 + 279 + 275 = 1205\n\n    This offer is greater than my outside option.\n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 3]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and decide on the best course of action.\n\nThe current offer to me is [1, 0, 1, 0, 3]. This means Player 1 is offering me:\n* 1 unit of item 1\n* 0 units of item 2\n* 1 unit of item 3\n* 0 units of item 4\n* 3 units of item 5\n\nMy values are:\n* Item 1: 67\n* Item 2: 18\n* Item 3: 98\n* Item 4: 95\n* Item 5: 86\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 67) + (0 * 18) + (1 * 98) + (0 * 95) + (3 * 86) = 67 + 0 + 98 + 0 + 258 = 423\n\nMy outside offer is 1178. Since 423 is much less than 1178, accepting this offer is not a good idea.\n\nNow, I need to consider making a counteroffer. My goal is to maximize my value, considering the discount factor in future rounds. Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. I need to figure out how to make a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept, while also ensuring my value is higher than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 half of each item. That would be:\nItem 1: 4 / 2 = 2\nItem 2: 3 / 2 = 1.5. Since we can only offer whole units, let's try 1 and 2\nItem 3: 4 / 2 = 2\nItem 4: 3 / 2 = 1.5. Again, try 1 and 2\nItem 5: 8 / 2 = 4\n\nLet's start by offering Player 1 [2, 1, 2, 1, 4].\nThis means I would keep [2, 2, 2, 2, 4].\nMy value would then be (2*67) + (2*18) + (2*98) + (2*95) + (4*86) = 134 + 36 + 196 + 190 + 344 = 900.\nThis is still less than my outside offer.\n\nSince I have 3 rounds to negotiate and a very high outside offer, it is worth making a more aggressive counteroffer to try and secure a better deal.\n\nLet's offer Player 1 slightly less than half and see if that encourages movement, and then I can determine my value from what remains: [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]\nThen I keep: [3, 2, 3, 2, 5]\n(3*67) + (2*18) + (3*98) + (2*95) + (5*86) = 201 + 36 + 294 + 190 + 430 = 1151\n\nStill less than my outside offer. I need to offer a counteroffer that will give me > 1178.\n\nLet's calculate how much of each item I need to keep to have more than my outside offer:\nOutside Offer: 1178\nTotal Value Possible: 1687\nI need 1178 / 1687 = 0.698 of all the items. \nSo I want to keep roughly 70% of the items and give away only 30%.\n\nGiven this, the maximum I can offer them and still make sense to me is:\nitem 1: 1\nitem 2: 0\nitem 3: 1\nitem 4: 0\nitem 5: 2\nValue to me is (3 * 67) + (3 * 18) + (3 * 98) + (3 * 95) + (6 * 86) = 201 + 54 + 294 + 285 + 516 = 1350\n\nSo I can still give them a bit more... What if I offer: [1, 0, 1, 0, 3]? I calculated this above and its only worth 423 to me.\n\nI need to make an offer that will net me at least 1178, and also is realistic to get them to accept.\n\nAfter some calculations, I believe the best offer to make is: [1, 1, 1, 1, 4] This way I'm only giving a small amount, and I get great returns.\nI keep: [3, 2, 3, 2, 4]\nValue to me: (3*67) + (2*18) + (3*98) + (2*95) + (4*86) = 201 + 36 + 294 + 190 + 344 = 1065\n\nStill not high enough. I need to get at least 1178 after the discount.\n\nI'm going to stick with my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

To make an informed decision about a counteroffer, I need to consider what I would ideally like to have and whether that's realistic. Since this is round 1, I have two more rounds to negotiate, so I can afford to be a little more aggressive.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer where I keep most of the items I value highly and give more of the less valuable items to player 1. I would want to keep most of item 3 and item 4 as I value those the highest after item 1, but it is available in low quantities, which I value highly.\nLet's try offering Player 1 the following: [1, 4, 4, 2, 2]\nThat means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nValue to me: (1 * 53) + (3 * 10) + (5 * 61) + (2 * 40) + (2 * 6) = 53 + 30 + 305 + 80 + 12 = 480\n\nSince I have a high outside offer of 785, let's be more aggressive with the offer I give to Player 1. My current value isn't even above the outside offer.\n\nLet's make the offer: [0, 6, 8, 3, 4]. This keeps the remaining items for me.\nValue to me: (2 * 53) + (1 * 10) + (1 * 61) + (1 * 40) + (1 * 6) = 106 + 10 + 61 + 40 + 6 = 223\nClearly a terrible offer for myself.\n\nLets make the following counteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This keeps all items for myself.\nValue to me: (2 * 53) + (7 * 10) + (9 * 61) + (4 * 40) + (5 * 6) = 106 + 70 + 549 + 160 + 30 = 915\n\nSince it is the first round, and I have a strong outside offer, I will make an aggressive counter offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means I get nothing, so my value is 0. This is way worse than my outside offer.\n\nPlayer 1 initially offered Player 2 [1, 4, 5, 2, 3]. This means I would have received [1, 3, 4, 2, 2] which has a value of 1 * 56 + 3 * 17 + 4 * 54 + 2 * 16 + 2 * 22 = 56 + 51 + 216 + 32 + 44 = 399.\nThen Player 2 offered me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nSince I'm in round 2, I need to discount any potential deals. The discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nSo I need to get at least 141 / 0.9 = 156.67 to make a deal worthwhile.\n\nGiving everything to Player 2 is not a good idea. I want to secure at least 156.67 value.\n\nI need to consider a counteroffer. I will aim to get slightly above my discounted outside offer of 156.67. Given the remaining round, my offer must be tempting enough for player 2 to accept, or they will simply walk away in round 3 to receive their outside option.\nLet's find a possible acceptable allocation for me:\nI want to be slightly above 157. I will try to obtain this by requesting only item 1, and nothing else.\nIf I get 2 item 1's, my value will be 2*56 = 112. This is insufficient\nWhat if I get one unit of item 3 and one unit of item 5? The value will be 54+22 = 76.\nLet's give player 2 almost everything, only keeping 1 unit of item 3 and 1 unit of item 5, giving them: [2, 7, 8, 4, 4].

My private values are 53, 10, 61, 40, and 6 for items 1 through 5. My outside offer is 785. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of Player 1's current offer to me:\n(0 * 53) + (3 * 10) + (4 * 61) + (2 * 40) + (2 * 6) = 0 + 30 + 244 + 80 + 12 = 366\n\nSince it's round 2, we need to apply the discount factor gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\nSo the discounted value of the current offer is 366 * 0.9 = 329.4\n\nMy outside offer is 785. Since 329.4 is less than 785, accepting the offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. We have the following amounts available to divide: 2 of item 1, 7 of item 2, 9 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 5 of item 5. I want to maximize my own value, so I want to keep as much of the high-value items (1 and 3) as possible for myself. Also, it's the second round.

Discounted value: 223 * 0.9 = 200.7. Significantly less than my outside offer, 785.\n\nGiven that it's round 2 and I need to get significantly more value to beat my outside offer of 785, it's likely best to just walk away at this point.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1064. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1011 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "OK. Let's analyze the offer and determine the best action.\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n*   3 units of item 1\n*   1 units of item 2\n*   2 units of item 3\n*   0 units of item 4\n*   2 units of item 5\n\nMy values for these items are:\n*   Item 1: 10\n*   Item 2: 90\n*   Item 3: 86\n*   Item 4: 82\n*   Item 5: 69\n\nSo the value of the current offer to me is:\n(3 * 10) + (1 * 90) + (2 * 86) + (0 * 82) + (2 * 69) = 30 + 90 + 172 + 0 + 138 = 430\n\nMy outside offer is 1064. Since 430 < 1064, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. We have 8 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 6 units of item 5. A possible strategy is to demand all of the items with high value for me and give all the low-value items to player 1. However, this is unlikely to be accepted. Another possible strategy is to ask for a split that provides me a value higher than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider a simple counteroffer where I take the majority of items 2, 3 and 4, and give most of items 1 and 5 to Player 1.\n\nCounteroffer: Give Player 1 [5, 0, 1, 0, 4]\n\nThis leaves me with:\n* Item 1: 8 - 5 = 3\n* Item 2: 4 - 0 = 4\n* Item 3: 6 - 1 = 5\n* Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2\n* Item 5: 6 - 4 = 2\n\nValue to me:\n(3 * 10) + (4 * 90) + (5 * 86) + (2 * 82) + (2 * 69) = 30 + 360 + 430 + 164 + 138 = 1122\n\nSince 1122 > 1064, this counteroffer is better than walking away.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 1, 0, 4]}\n",

My private values are 65, 71, 56, 93, and 58. My outside offer is 956, and the discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of Player 2's current offer to me:\n(5 * 65) + (0 * 71) + (1 * 56) + (0 * 93) + (4 * 58) = 325 + 0 + 56 + 0 + 232 = 613\n\nSince it's round 2, the discounted value of accepting this offer is:\n613 * 0.9^(2-1) = 613 * 0.9 = 551.7\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 956. Therefore, accepting Player 2's current offer is not a good idea.\n\nNext, I need to consider whether to walk away or make a counteroffer.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's think step by step.\n\nSince this is round 1 and there's no offer on the table, I need to make an initial offer to Player 2. My goal is to maximize my utility, taking into account the discount factor and my outside offer.\n\nMy values are:\nItem 1: 100 (0 units available)\nItem 2: 78 (4 units available)\nItem 3: 34 (2 units available)\nItem 4: 32 (3 units available)\nItem 5: 55 (3 units available)\nOutside offer: 425\n\nI want to make an offer that is attractive enough for Player 2 to accept, but also gives me a good share of the items. Since I don't know Player 2's values, a reasonable starting point is to offer a split that gives them slightly more than half the total value, if we assume their values are close to mine. However, to be safe, I will aim for an offer that would give them about half of the potential value, and see how they respond. \n\nA completely even split isn't possible due to the limited number of items. I should consider how the value is distributed.\nTotal possible value if I keep everything is: (0 * 100) + (4 * 78) + (2 * 34) + (3 * 32) + (3 * 55) = 0 + 312 + 68 + 96 + 165 = 641.\n\nLet's try an offer giving Player 2 roughly half the total value, say around 320. I'll start by giving them a larger portion of items that I value less, in the hope that they value them more.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 2 (2 * 78 = 156)\nItem 3: 1 (1 * 34 = 34)\nItem 4: 2 (2 * 32 = 64)\nItem 5: 2 (2 * 55 = 110)\nTotal offer value to me = 156 + 34 + 64 + 110 = 364.\n\nThis offer gives Player 2 a value of 364, leaving me with 641 - 364 = 277 if they accept. This is below my outside offer of 425, which is unacceptable.\nTo make this attractive enough for Player 2, I would need to offer more. I'm worried that this approach may not be beneficial, and I risk losing out compared to my outside offer. \n\nAnother approach is to offer them close to the total value of items I have. I would only receive the benefit of 425 (my outside offer) if the offer is rejected, which is much lower than the 641 if I kept everything.\n\nI should consider a better initial offer than a coin flip strategy. I want to make an offer that gives Player 2 enough value that they might accept, without giving away too much of my own value.\n\nItem 2: 4 units, value 78\nItem 3: 2 units, value 34\nItem 4: 3 units, value 32\nItem 5: 3 units, value 55\n\nLet's aim for giving player 2 around half of the maximum value of 641, i.e. 320. I will target items that I personally value lower.\n\nOffer:\nItem 2: 1 (78)\nItem 3: 1 (34)\nItem 4: 2 (64)\nItem 5: 2 (110)\nTotal: 78 + 34 + 64 + 110 = 286\nRemaining Value = 641 - 286 = 355\n\nThis leaves me with 355 if they accept. Since this is less than my outside offer of 425, I should consider if a rejection leads to a better outcome in later rounds. Considering the discount rate, I'm not sure about taking that risk.\n\nGiven the complexities and lack of information, I will stick with my outside offer.\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 392. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 759 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, accepting this offer is not a good idea.\n\nNow, I need to consider making a counteroffer. Since it is round 2, I need to consider that Player 2 has the final say. To maximize my expected value, I want to make an offer that Player 2 is likely to accept, but still provides me with more value than my outside option when discounted.\n\nIf I walk away, my value is 137. If I accept, it is 3.6. Thus I should make a counteroffer.\n\nLet's construct a possible counteroffer. First, I need to figure out the total amount of items to divide. I have:\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 7\nItem 3: 6\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 5\n\nI should offer some of each item to Player 2. A reasonable start might be half of each, rounding up or down as needed. I will try offering half of each and evaluate. This will give me some value to compare to my outside option.\n\nProposed Offer to Player 2: [1, 3, 3, 2, 2]\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 2: 7 - 3 = 4\nItem 3: 6 - 3 = 3\nItem 4: 4 - 2 = 2\nItem 5: 5 - 2 = 3\n\nMy value for keeping these items is:\n(2 * 61) + (4 * 4) + (3 * 89) + (2 * 79) + (3 * 92) = 122 + 16 + 267 + 158 + 276 = 839\n\nNow, I must discount this by 0.9, which results in 839 * 0.9 = 755.1\n\nSince 755.1 > 137, I would prefer this to walking away, and presumably Player 2 may agree as it would give them some value.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 3, 2, 2]}\n",

I need to keep more units.\n- Item 1: Offer 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 2)\n- Item 2: Offer 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 2)\n- Item 3: Offer 4 units to Player 2 (I keep 4)\n- Item 4: Offer 3 units to Player 2 (I keep 4)\n- Item 5: Offer 2 units to Player 2 (I keep 2)\n\nMy value for this division would be:\n(2 * 58) + (2 * 31) + (4 * 80) + (4 * 90) + (2 * 90) = 116 + 62 + 320 + 360 + 180 = 1038\n\nLet's try this offer:\n- Item 1: Offer 0 unit to Player 2 (I keep 3)\n- Item 2: Offer 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 2)\n- Item 3: Offer 4 units to Player 2 (I keep 4)\n- Item 4: Offer 3 units to Player 2 (I keep 4)\n- Item 5: Offer 2 units to Player 2 (I keep 2)\n\nMy value for this division would be:\n(3 * 58) + (2 * 31) + (4 * 80) + (4 * 90) + (2 * 90) = 174 + 62 + 320 + 360 + 180 = 1096\n\nLet's try this offer:\n- Item 1: Offer 0 unit to Player 2 (I keep 3)\n- Item 2: Offer 0 unit to Player 2 (I keep 3)\n- Item 3: Offer 4 units to Player 2 (I keep 4)\n- Item 4: Offer 3 units to Player 2 (I keep 4)\n- Item 5: Offer 2 units to Player 2 (I keep 2)\n\nMy value for this division would be:\n(3 * 58) + (3 * 31) + (4 * 80) + (4 * 90) + (2 * 90) = 174 + 93 + 320 + 360 + 180 = 1127\n\nLet's try this offer:\n- Item 1: Offer 0 unit to Player 2 (I keep 3)\n- Item 2: Offer 0 unit to Player 2 (I keep 3)\n- Item 3: Offer 3 units to Player 2 (I keep 5)\n- Item 4: Offer 3 units to Player 2 (I keep 4)\n- Item 5: Offer 2 units to Player 2 (I keep 2)\n\nMy value for this division would be:\n(3 * 58) + (3 * 31) + (5 * 80) + (4 * 90) + (2 * 90) = 174 + 93 + 400 + 360 + 180 = 1207\nThis is still too low.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1451. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1065 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It is round 2. The current offer on the table is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I would receive 1 unit of item 1, and 0 units of the other items. My values are 50 for item 1, 79 for item 2, 39 for item 3, 92 for item 4, and 95 for item 5. My outside offer is 1451. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nIf I accept the current offer, my value would be 1 * 50 + 0 * 79 + 0 * 39 + 0 * 92 + 0 * 95 = 50. Applying the discount factor for round 2 (0.9^(2-1) = 0.9), my discounted value is 50 * 0.9 = 45. This is significantly lower than my outside offer of 1451.\n\nTherefore, accepting is not a good option. Walking away would give me 1451.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to offer Player 2 a distribution of the items. My goal is to maximize my own value, but I also need to offer Player 2 enough that they will accept it in round 3, considering the discount factor. Since this is round 2, Player 2's payoff will be multiplied by 0.9 if a deal is reached in round 3. If no deal is reached, they get their outside offer.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I take almost everything and give Player 2 a little something. The total number of items are 5 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n\nI'll try offering Player 2 just 1 unit of item 1. That means I keep 4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\nMy value for this is 4 * 50 + 4 * 79 + 4 * 39 + 5 * 92 + 4 * 95 = 200 + 316 + 156 + 460 + 380 = 1512.\nApplying the discount factor (0.9), the discounted value is 1512 * 0.9 = 1360.8.\n\nIf I want to beat my outside offer, I need to aim for an undiscounted total value greater than 1451 / 0.9 = 1612.22. This seems unlikely given the available items.\n\nInstead, since I have a high outside option, I will propose something beneficial to me but not too greedy to the other player, in the hopes they might accept next round rather than walk away.\n\nI will offer Player 2: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]. That means I keep 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\nMy value for this is 3 * 50 + 2 * 79 + 2 * 39 + 3 * 92 + 2 * 95 = 150 + 158 + 78 + 276 + 190 = 852. Applying the discount factor 0.9, the discounted value is 766.8.\n\nI should probably aim to get closer to my outside offer but not so greedy as to provoke a walk. I will keep more items this time.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\nMy value: 4 * 50 + 3 * 79 + 3 * 39 + 4 * 92 + 3 * 95 = 200 + 237 + 117 + 368 + 285 = 1207.\nDiscounted value = 1207 * 0.9 = 1086.3, still below my outside option.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 the original offer back but with a little extra. Offer [1,0,0,0,0].\n\nOkay, I will make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me than accepting the current offer, but perhaps not too greedy.\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n",

Clearly, 252 is much better than 57, so walking away is not a good option.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 1, and there's no offer on the table. I need to make an initial offer to Player 2. My goal is to maximize my expected value, taking into account the discount factor and my outside offer.\n\nMy values are:\n- Item 1: 69 (0 units)\n- Item 2: 53 (4 units)\n- Item 3: 97 (6 units)\n- Item 4: 61 (1 unit)\n- Item 5: 79 (7 units)\nTotal value = 0*69 + 4*53 + 6*97 + 1*61 + 7*79 = 0 + 212 + 582 + 61 + 553 = 1408\nOutside offer: 801\n\nI want to make an offer that is attractive to Player 2, but also leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer when discounted over the potential rounds. Since I don't know Player 2's values, I'll aim for a relatively even split of the value, leaning slightly in my favor to account for the discount factor and my outside offer.\n\nA simple starting point could be to offer Player 2 roughly half the items, adjusted to give me slightly more valuable items and take into account that I have an outside option of 801 to fall back on.\n\nLet's consider giving Player 2:\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 0 units\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 4 units\n\nMy value for this division:\n0*69 + 2*53 + 3*97 + 1*61 + 4*79 = 0 + 106 + 291 + 61 + 316 = 774\n\nPlayer 2 gets:\n2*53 + 3*97 + 0*61 + 3*79 = 106 + 291 + 0 + 237 = 634\n\nThis split gives me a value of 774. If I don't make a deal in round 1, in round 2, my value is multiplied by 0.9 so 774 * .9 = 696.6. Which is below my outside offer value of 801, so let me try making an offer that will potentially result in a higher immediate payout.\n\nAnother possible offer that might work is:\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 2 units\n- Item 4: 0 units\n- Item 5: 2 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 3 units\n- Item 3: 4 units\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 5 units\n\nMy value for this division:\n0*69 + 3*53 + 4*97 + 1*61 + 5*79 = 0 + 159 + 388 + 61 + 395 = 1003\n\nPlayer 2 gets:\n1*53 + 2*97 + 0*61 + 2*79 = 53 + 194 + 0 + 158 = 405\n\nMy value is 1003 which is much higher than the outside offer of 801. It's possible Player 2 may reject this offer so let's increase the offer slightly:\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 0 units\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 3 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 4 units\n\nMy value for this division:\n0*69 + 3*53 + 3*97 + 1*61 + 4*79 = 0 + 159 + 291 + 61 + 316 = 827\n\nPlayer 2 gets:\n1*53 + 3*97 + 0*61 + 3*79 = 53 + 291 + 0 + 237 = 581\n\nThis is closer to splitting it down the middle while still remaining above my outside offer.\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 0, 3]}\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and decide on the best action.\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 is [0, 1, 3, 0, 3], meaning they are offering me 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nMy values for each item are: 56, 17, 29, 97, 7.\n\nSo, the value of this offer to me is:\n(0 * 56) + (1 * 17) + (3 * 29) + (0 * 97) + (3 * 7) = 0 + 17 + 87 + 0 + 21 = 125\n\nMy outside offer is 229. Since 125 < 229, accepting this offer would be worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. We have a few rounds to negotiate, so we don't need to offer everything right away. We need to make an offer that is attractive to Player 1, but also leaves us with a value greater than our outside offer.\n\nLet's try to find a beneficial split. Total items are: 0 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 7 of item 5. Let's aim to secure the one unit of item 4, as it has a very high value to me.\nLet's consider offering Player 1 half of items 2, 3, and 5. Since there are no units of item 1, we have to give 0.\nSo, we offer [0, 2, 3, 0, 4].\n\nThis would leave me with: 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\nMy value would be: (0 * 56) + (2 * 17) + (3 * 29) + (1 * 97) + (3 * 7) = 0 + 34 + 87 + 97 + 21 = 239.\nSince 239 > 229, this is a better outcome than walking away immediately.\n\nNow, the question is, is offering Player 1 [0, 2, 3, 0, 4] a good opening offer? This means they get:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 0\nItem 5: 4\n\nWe don't know Player 1's values, so we don't know if this is attractive to them.

My values for these items are 69, 53, 97, 61, and 79, respectively.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of this offer to me:\n* Item 1: 0 * 69 = 0\n* Item 2: 2 * 53 = 106\n* Item 3: 3 * 97 = 291\n* Item 4: 0 * 61 = 0\n* Item 5: 4 * 79 = 316\nTotal value of the offer = 0 + 106 + 291 + 0 + 316 = 713\n\nNow, I need to consider the discount factor. Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nSo, the present value of the offer is 713 * 0.9 = 641.7\n\nMy outside offer is 801. Since the present value of the current offer (641.7) is less than my outside offer (801), accepting the current offer is not in my best interest.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I need to decide what to offer Player 2.  The total available items are [0, 4, 6, 1, 7].  Player 2's offer in Round 1 was [0, 2, 3, 0, 4]. Player 1's offer in round 1 was [0, 1, 3, 0, 3]. This means that in round 1, I offered Player 2 [0,1,3,0,3] and the current offer gives me [0,2,3,0,4].\nMy outside offer is 801. I want to make an offer that Player 2 will accept but still gives me at least 801/0.9 = 890 in value to me.\n\nLet's try to make a counteroffer that gives player 2 a little more. I will offer Player 2 [0, 2, 3, 0, 3].\n\nThis leaves me with [0, 2, 3, 1, 4]. The value of this to me is:\n* Item 1: 0 * 69 = 0\n* Item 2: 2 * 53 = 106\n* Item 3: 3 * 97 = 291\n* Item 4: 1 * 61 = 61\n* Item 5: 4 * 79 = 316\nTotal value = 0 + 106 + 291 + 61 + 316 = 774\n\nThe discounted value is 774 * 0.9 = 696.6. This is still less than my outside offer, so let's try another counteroffer. I need to increase the value to me.\n\nLet's offer Player 2 [0, 1, 2, 0, 3].\n\nThis leaves me with [0, 3, 4, 1, 4]. The value of this to me is:\n* Item 1: 0 * 69 = 0\n* Item 2: 3 * 53 = 159\n* Item 3: 4 * 97 = 388\n* Item 4: 1 * 61 = 61\n* Item 5: 4 * 79 = 316\nTotal value = 0 + 159 + 388 + 61 + 316 = 924\n\nThe discounted value is 924 * 0.9 = 831.6. This is greater than my outside offer of 801. I am willing to make this offer if I believe Player 2 will accept it, or if the values I give him is at least as valuable as his outside offer.\n\nLet's finalize with the counteroffer [0, 1, 2, 0, 3].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 0, 3]}\n```",

Half of the total value is 332.\nI can make a counter offer to give them roughly half of the value of each item type.\nitem 1: I have 4, I give them 2. 2 * 86 = 172\nitem 2: I have 3, I give them 1. 1 * 28 = 28\nitem 3: I have 2, I give them 1. 1 * 13 = 13\nitem 4: I have 2, I give them 1. 1 * 51 = 51\nitem 5: I have 4, I give them 2. 2 * 27 = 54\nTotal offered = 172 + 28 + 13 + 51 + 54 = 318. Close to half the value.\n\nSo I offer Player 1 [2, 1, 1, 1, 2].\nMy value is now:\n2 * 86 + 2 * 28 + 1 * 13 + 1 * 51 + 2 * 27 = 172 + 56 + 13 + 51 + 54 = 346.\nWith the discount factor, my value is 346 * 0.9 = 311.4. This is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

Since 298.89 is less than 517, accepting is not ideal.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I try to get closer to half of each item.\nCurrent total value of all items to me: (4 * 33) + (3 * 22) + (2 * 39) + (2 * 82) + (4 * 80) = 132 + 66 + 78 + 164 + 320 = 760. Half of this is 380.  Since accepting is worse than my outside offer, I want something greater than that discounted.\n\nI'll try to get closer to half. I'll try to offer them [1, 1, 0, 0, 1], which is my original offer from Round 1. This would give me [3, 2, 2, 2, 3].\n\nValue of [3, 2, 2, 2, 3]: (3 * 33) + (2 * 22) + (2 * 39) + (2 * 82) + (3 * 80) = 99 + 44 + 78 + 164 + 240 = 625\nPresent value: 625 * 0.81 = 506.25. This is still less than my outside offer.\n\nHowever, since it's the last round and Player 2 won't be able to respond, any counteroffer I make that Player 2 doesn't want is equivalent to walking away. Therefore, if I make a counteroffer and Player 2 rejects it, I'll just get my outside option of 517. If I accept, I get 298.89. Therefore, my only move that guarantees a value above the current offer to me is walking away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

A simple starting point is to divide everything roughly in half. Let's try giving Player 2 the following:\n\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 3 units\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 2 units (2 * 100 = 200)\n- Item 2: 3 units (3 * 65 = 195)\n- Item 3: 2 units (2 * 19 = 38)\n- Item 4: 2 units (2 * 12 = 24)\n- Item 5: 3 units (3 * 49 = 147)\nTotal Value for me = 200 + 195 + 38 + 24 + 147 = 604\n\nSince my outside offer is 376, and 604 > 376, this split looks better than walking away immediately. Now, let's try to \"squeeze\" Player 2 a bit more to test how they respond. I can reduce the amount given to Player 2 and see if it gets accepted/countered.\nConsider offering the player less of item 2 and 5, which I have the most units of.\nOffer:\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 2 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 2 units (2 * 100 = 200)\n- Item 2: 4 units (4 * 65 = 260)\n- Item 3: 2 units (2 * 19 = 38)\n- Item 4: 2 units (2 * 12 = 24)\n- Item 5: 4 units (4 * 49 = 196)\nTotal Value for me = 200 + 260 + 38 + 24 + 196 = 718\n\nThis new value, 718, is significantly higher than my outside offer of 376.

                    "response": "Okay, let's start by assessing my situation. My outside offer is 874. I need to make an offer that will be appealing to Player 2 while ensuring I get at least 874 discounted by the number of rounds. Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. So, I need to get at least 874 in this round.\n\nI have:\n*   3 units of item 1, value 100 each\n*   4 units of item 2, value 87 each\n*   4 units of item 3, value 26 each\n*   3 units of item 4, value 9 each\n*   3 units of item 5, value 47 each\n\nTotal value = (3 * 100) + (4 * 87) + (4 * 26) + (3 * 9) + (3 * 47) = 300 + 348 + 104 + 27 + 141 = 920.\n\nI want to make an offer that Player 2 is likely to accept. I don't know their valuations, but I can assume they are rational. A reasonable starting point is to offer them slightly more than half of the items, hoping that their valuations are close enough to mine that this is a good deal for both of us. Let's try offering Player 2:\n\n*   1 unit of item 1\n*   2 unit of item 2\n*   2 unit of item 3\n*   1 unit of item 4\n*   1 unit of item 5\n\nThis means I would keep:\n*   2 unit of item 1: 2 * 100 = 200\n*   2 unit of item 2: 2 * 87 = 174\n*   2 unit of item 3: 2 * 26 = 52\n*   2 unit of item 4: 2 * 9 = 18\n*   2 unit of item 5: 2 * 47 = 94\nMy total value would be: 200 + 174 + 52 + 18 + 94 = 538\n\nThat's significantly less than my outside offer. I need to offer them less to keep enough value for myself. I will offer:\n\n*   0 unit of item 1\n*   1 unit of item 2\n*   1 unit of item 3\n*   0 unit of item 4\n*   0 unit of item 5\n\nThis means I would keep:\n*   3 unit of item 1: 3 * 100 = 300\n*   3 unit of item 2: 3 * 87 = 261\n*   3 unit of item 3: 3 * 26 = 78\n*   3 unit of item 4: 3 * 9 = 27\n*   3 unit of item 5: 3 * 47 = 141\nMy total value would be: 300 + 261 + 78 + 27 + 141 = 807\n\nStill lower than my outside offer. Let's increase my offer slightly:\n*   0 unit of item 1\n*   0 unit of item 2\n*   1 unit of item 3\n*   0 unit of item 4\n*   0 unit of item 5\n\nThis means I would keep:\n*   3 unit of item 1: 3 * 100 = 300\n*   4 unit of item 2: 4 * 87 = 348\n*   3 unit of item 3: 3 * 26 = 78\n*   3 unit of item 4: 3 * 9 = 27\n*   3 unit of item 5: 3 * 47 = 141\nMy total value would be: 300 + 348 + 78 + 27 + 141 = 894\n\nThis is higher than my outside offer of 874, so I'll make this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

If I make an offer where I keep some items, Player 2 would still benefit compared to walking away (since that is effectively a [0,0,0,0,0] offer for them). Therefore, the strategy to maximize my value is to make an offer to keep more items for myself.\n\nGiven all this, walking away seems the best option since my outside offer is high.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 843. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 672 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and decide on the best action.\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 gives me:\n*   2 units of item 1\n*   1 unit of item 2\n*   2 units of item 3\n*   1 unit of item 4\n*   4 units of item 5\n\nThis means I keep:\n*   3 - 2 = 1 unit of item 1\n*   3 - 1 = 2 units of item 2\n*   4 - 2 = 2 units of item 3\n*   3 - 1 = 2 units of item 4\n*   8 - 4 = 4 units of item 5\n\nThe value of this offer to me is:\n*   1 * 29 (item 1) + 2 * 47 (item 2) + 2 * 22 (item 3) + 2 * 30 (item 4) + 4 * 96 (item 5) = 29 + 94 + 44 + 60 + 384 = 611\n\nSince my outside offer is 843, accepting the current offer of 611 is worse.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer.

I will make a counteroffer that gives me approximately my outside option.\n\nLet's make a counteroffer where I get most of Item 5, and a fair amount of Items 2 and 4 since I have a high value for those items.\nI will give Player 1:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 4\n\nThis means that for myself, I would have:\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 4\n\nValue to me:\n2*29 + 2*47 + 2*22 + 2*30 + 4*96 = 58 + 94 + 44 + 60 + 384 = 640\n\nThis value is still less than my outside option of 843.

Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nDiscounted value of the current offer: 822 * 0.9 = 739.8\n\nMy outside offer is 171.

I need to decide whether to accept this, walk away, or make another counteroffer.\n\nLet's analyze a possible counteroffer. I want to keep as much of item 3 and item 4 as possible since these have the highest values to me (91 and 85 respectively). I would like to give the other player more of item 2 which has a decent quantity available and lower value to me (55).\n\nWhat if I offered Player 2 [2, 7, 2, 2, 2]?\n\nThat means I would get:\nItem 1: 5 - 2 = 3\nItem 2: 10 - 7 = 3\nItem 3: 5 - 2 = 3\nItem 4: 4 - 2 = 2\nItem 5: 4 - 2 = 2\n\nValue to me:\nItem 1: 3 * 29 = 87\nItem 2: 3 * 55 = 165\nItem 3: 3 * 91 = 273\nItem 4: 2 * 85 = 170\nItem 5: 2 * 59 = 118\nTotal: 87 + 165 + 273 + 170 + 118 = 813\nDiscounted value: 813 * 0.9 = 731.7\n\nCompared to the current discounted offer of 739.8, this counteroffer gives me a slightly worse result (731.7 < 739.8). Also, it is possible that player 2 could reject this offer and walk away, which would give me only 171.\n\nGiven the circumstances and the risk of walking away, I'll accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

I need to make an initial offer to Player 2.\n\nMy goal is to maximize my expected discounted value. Since it's the first round, there's no discount yet. I need to estimate what Player 2 might accept. A fair starting point might be to divide the items roughly in proportion to our total values. However, without knowing Player 2's values, this is risky.\n\nA safer strategy is to make a relatively generous offer to Player 2, which hopefully they will accept. This avoids the risk of walking away and getting only my outside offer. Let's aim for a split where I get slightly more than my outside offer. I need to consider the discount factor in later rounds.\n\nLet's start with an offer that gives Player 2 roughly half of the items.\n\n*   Item 1: Offer 2 to Player 2, I keep 2.  Value to me: 2 * 52 = 104\n*   Item 2: Offer 1 to Player 2, I keep 2.  Value to me: 2 * 53 = 106\n*   Item 3: Offer 4 to Player 2, I keep 4.  Value to me: 4 * 5 = 20\n*   Item 4: Offer 2 to Player 2, I keep 2.  Value to me: 2 * 35 = 70\n*   Item 5: Offer 1 to Player 2, I keep 2.  Value to me: 2 * 55 = 110\n\nTotal value to me = 104 + 106 + 20 + 70 + 110 = 410. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 515.\n\nI need to adjust my offer to be more favorable to myself. Let's try giving Player 2 a smaller share, while still being reasonable enough for them to consider it.\n\n*   Item 1: Offer 1 to Player 2, I keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 52 = 156\n*   Item 2: Offer 1 to Player 2, I keep 2. Value to me: 2 * 53 = 106\n*   Item 3: Offer 3 to Player 2, I keep 5. Value to me: 5 * 5 = 25\n*   Item 4: Offer 1 to Player 2, I keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 35 = 105\n*   Item 5: Offer 1 to Player 2, I keep 2. Value to me: 2 * 55 = 110\n\nTotal Value to me = 156 + 106 + 25 + 105 + 110 = 502. This is still slightly below my outside offer. Let's adjust again.\n\n*   Item 1: Offer 1 to Player 2, I keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 52 = 156\n*   Item 2: Offer 0 to Player 2, I keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 53 = 159\n*   Item 3: Offer 3 to Player 2, I keep 5. Value to me: 5 * 5 = 25\n*   Item 4: Offer 1 to Player 2, I keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 35 = 105\n*   Item 5: Offer 1 to Player 2, I keep 2.

This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\nMy values for each item are: 100, 50, 39, 10, 94.\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(0 * 100) + (4 * 50) + (1 * 39) + (1 * 10) + (4 * 94) = 0 + 200 + 39 + 10 + 376 = 625.\n\nMy outside offer is 445. Since 625 > 445, accepting the current offer is better than walking away immediately.\n\nHowever, this is only round 1. I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.  The discount factor will reduce the value in future rounds, but if I can significantly improve my position, it might be worthwhile.\n\nLet's consider what a perfectly fair split would look like. The available items are:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 6\nItem 3: 5\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 5\n\nA fair split *might* involve offering Player 1 roughly half of each item. Since I want to maximize my gains, I need to consider what Player 1 values most. I don't know Player 1's values, but if I offer them slightly more of the items I value less, they might accept.\n\nLet's analyze what I would get if I took *everything*:\n0 * 100 + 6 * 50 + 5 * 39 + 4 * 10 + 5 * 94 = 0 + 300 + 195 + 40 + 470 = 1005.\n\nI'm currently being offered 625. I want to at least match that in any counter offer I propose. I want to see if I can shift some of the value toward my side.\n\nThe current offer gives Player 1:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 6-4=2\nItem 3: 5-1=4\nItem 4: 4-1=3\nItem 5: 5-4=1\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1: [0, 2, 4, 3, 1] as a counteroffer. This leaves me with [0, 4, 1, 1, 4], which is the same as what I am currently offered. Since I value this at 625 and it's greater than 445, it is rational for me to propose this offer in round 1.

Compare the offer to my outside option:**\n\nMy outside option is 670. The current offer is worth 267, which is significantly less than my outside option.\n\n**3. Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nSince I have a good outside option, I should only consider a counteroffer if it can potentially yield a significantly higher value than 670 after the discount factor is applied in later rounds.\n\nTo begin, let's evaluate the item totals: 4 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 6 of item 5.\nIf I make a counteroffer at the next round, the value would be discounted by 0.9.

I want to maximize my value, taking into account that this is round 1 and there are 2 more rounds with a discount factor of 0.9. It's difficult to know Player 1's values, so I will aim for a split that gives me at least my outside offer value if the game ends now.\n\nThe total number of items are:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 4\n- Item 3: 6\n- Item 4: 8\n- Item 5: 2\n\nMy total value for all items is 1319.\nPlayer 1's offer gives me a value of 630.

That means I get:\n\n*   Item 1: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n*   Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n*   Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n*   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n*   Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n\n*   3 * 29 (item 1) = 87\n*   3 * 55 (item 2) = 165\n*   1 * 51 (item 3) = 51\n*   2 * 3 (item 4) = 6\n*   1 * 15 (item 5) = 15\n*   Total value = 87 + 165 + 51 + 6 + 15 = 324\n\nDiscounted by 0.9, this is 324 * 0.9 = 291.6. This is still slightly less than my outside offer of 298, but a better starting point than accepting Player 1's current offer.\n\nLet's improve it by reducing item 4, since I value it so little. Offer [3, 2, 0, 0, 1]. That means I get:\n\n*   Item 1: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n*   Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n*   Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n*   Item 4: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n*   Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n\n*   3 * 29 (item 1) = 87\n*   3 * 55 (item 2) = 165\n*   1 * 51 (item 3) = 51\n*   3 * 3 (item 4) = 9\n*   1 * 15 (item 5) = 15\n*   Total value = 87 + 165 + 51 + 9 + 15 = 327\n\nDiscounted by 0.9, this is 327 * 0.9 = 294.3. Still slightly less than my walkaway.\n\nLets try offering them [3, 2, 0, 0, 0]. That means I get:\n\n*   Item 1: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n*   Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n*   Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n*   Item 4: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n*   Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 unit\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n\n*   3 * 29 (item 1) = 87\n*   3 * 55 (item 2) = 165\n*   1 * 51 (item 3) = 51\n*   3 * 3 (item 4) = 9\n*   2 * 15 (item 5) = 30\n*   Total value = 87 + 165 + 51 + 9 + 30 = 342\n\nDiscounted by 0.9, this is 342 * 0.9 = 307.8.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since 174.15 is less than 396, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, I will consider making a counteroffer. Since this is the last round, any counteroffer from Player 2 will be treated as a WALK. This means if I make a counteroffer, I have to propose something that I would prefer *and* that I think Player 2 might accept.\n\nLet's consider what Player 2's current offer to me implies about their valuation. They are offering me [3, 2, 0, 0, 0]. This means they get to keep [3, 3, 1, 3, 2]. We do not know their valuation function, so let's assume the negotiation has reached an impasse (i.e. they are happy to walk away at this point)\n\nIf they are happy to walk away, then they value their current allocation at >=396 * 0.9^2 = 320.76 (Player 2 outside offer discount rate same as mine) .\nIt is difficult to craft a counteroffer which Player 2 is more likely to accept, so let us consider if there exists one which provides a total value to me higher than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 2 slightly less than what they currently have (making it less likely to accept). How about [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]? That leaves me with [4, 4, 1, 3, 2].\nValue for me:\n4*71 + 4*1 + 1*33 + 3*66 + 2*88 = 284 + 4 + 33 + 198 + 176 = 695\n\nDiscounted value: 695 * 0.81 = 562.95\n\nSince this is higher than my outside offer of 396, it is better than walking away. But is it more likely for Player 2 to ACCEPT this?\nI will attempt one final counter offer which makes a minimal change to the current state in order to be better than walking away.\nCurrent state: Offer to Player 2 is [3, 3, 1, 3, 2].\nRevised offer to Player 2: [3, 2, 0, 0, 0]. Total value to me: 215\nWalking away = 396.\nWith a discount factor of 0.81 (i.e. 0.9^2), my value will be significantly lowered, therefore the counteroffer must lead to higher value than 396.\n\nSince it is not trivial to guess the other player's valuation function, and this is the last round, it may be best to play it safe and walk away rather than make an unfavourable counter offer that the other player may simply reject anyway (leading to 396).\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

So the discounted value of accepting this offer is 123 * 0.9 = 110.7\n\nMy outside offer is 426, which would also be discounted by 0.9 in this round: 426 * 0.9 = 383.4\n\nThe discounted value of accepting the current offer (110.7) is less than the discounted value of my outside offer (383.4). Therefore, accepting the current offer is not a good option.\n\nNow I should consider making a counteroffer. My goal is to find a counteroffer that Player 2 might accept, and which gives me a higher value than my outside offer. I should also consider the discount factor for the next round (0.9^2 = 0.81). Since this is round 2, if I make a counteroffer, Player 2 has the last move, and could just walk away.\n\nGiven the limited number of rounds, I should aim for a counteroffer that gives me a value close to, but above, my outside offer. I need to keep (or get from Player 2) enough items to be worth more than 426 in total. The totals are: 0 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n\nLet's try to aim for something that gives me just over my outside offer, while giving Player 2 a reasonable amount. To start with, what if I offered Player 2 my original offer from round 1 of [0, 2, 1, 2, 2] which player 2 rejected.

Since 329.4 < 637, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I should try to offer Player 1 something that is worth less to me than what I get in return, while also being attractive enough for them to accept.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 905. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 837 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

I need to make a counteroffer that is beneficial to me. Since I want to maximize my value, I need to consider the discount factor in future rounds.\n\nI want to make an offer that is good enough for Player 2 to accept, but still gives me a large portion of the items. I will start by offering Player 2 a division where they get slightly more than half the value of the items according to my valuation, since they will have their own valuation.\n\nLet's start by giving the other player half of the items. I have 2 of Item 1, 5 of Item 2, 2 of Item 3, 1 of Item 4, and 6 of Item 5.\nIf I give the other player:\n1 unit of item 1, its value to me is 65.\n2 units of item 2, its value to me is 110.\n1 unit of item 3, its value to me is 58.\n0 units of item 4, its value to me is 0.\n3 units of item 5, its value to me is 210.\nTotal value to me of what I'm offering = 65 + 110 + 58 + 0 + 210 = 443.\n\nThen my own value would be 972 - 443 = 529. This is less than my outside offer. This also doesn't consider Player 2's valuation which would most likely mean the offer is too low.\n\nI need to offer more to the other player to make an offer that is valuable enough for them to accept it. However, the most important thing is that I get more than my outside option.\n\nGiven I have 3 rounds, and the discount factor is 0.9, if I get my outside offer of 905 this round, the equivalent values for the next two rounds are:\nRound 2: 905 / 0.9 = 1005.56\nRound 3: 905 / (0.9 * 0.9) = 1117.98\n\nI need to make an offer now that is greater than 905.\n\nLet's try this:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 0\nItem 5: 3\n\nValue to Player 2:\n1 * their value + 3 * their value + 1 * their value + 0 + 3 * their value.\n\nMy value:\nItem 1: 1 * 65 = 65\nItem 2: 2 * 55 = 110\nItem 3: 1 * 58 = 58\nItem 4: 1 * 31 = 31\nItem 5: 3 * 70 = 210\n\nMy total value is 65 + 110 + 58 + 31 + 210 = 474.\nThis is not enough! I need more than my outside offer!\n\nHow about giving the other player only item 4?\nItem 4: 1\nMy value: 972 - 31 = 941\nThis is greater than 905.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n",

Since 84 is significantly less than 1209, I should definitely not accept this offer. I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1209, or walk away. Walking away guarantees me 1209.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer. I want to keep as much of item 5 as possible, since it has the highest value to me.\n\nHere's a possible counteroffer: Give Player 1 everything except 6 units of Item 5. That means Player 1 receives 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. In this case, my value is 6 * 95 = 570. Still less than my outside offer, so that's not good.\n\nI need to formulate a counteroffer such that my value exceeds 1209. Since it is round 1, there is no discount factor yet.\n\nIf I give player 1 nothing, then I have:\n2 * 82 + 5 * 51 + 2 * 75 + 1 * 84 + 6 * 95 = 164 + 255 + 150 + 84 + 570 = 1223\nSo keeping everything is worth 1223.\n\nIf I give away 1 unit of item 5, then I have\n2 * 82 + 5 * 51 + 2 * 75 + 1 * 84 + 5 * 95 = 164 + 255 + 150 + 84 + 475 = 1128\n\nIf I offer Player 1 all the items, that leaves me with nothing, worth 0.\n\nLet's try to make a reasonable counteroffer that is closer to even but still benefits me more than my outside option. My total value is 1223, so half would be 611.5. Let's aim for something around 611.5 for Player 1.\nPlayer 1's values are unknown.\n\nLet's think of a counteroffer that gives me a lot of item 5: Let's offer them: [2, 5, 2, 1, 3]. Then my value is: 0*82 + 0*51 + 0*75 + 0*84 + 3*95 = 285. Still not better than the walkaway.\n\nLet's offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That keeps all the items for me. My value is 1223.

The current offer on the table is [0, 1, 0, 0, 1], meaning I get 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of this offer to me:\n* Item 1: 0 * 82 = 0\n* Item 2: 1 * 51 = 51\n* Item 3: 0 * 75 = 0\n* Item 4: 0 * 84 = 0\n* Item 5: 1 * 95 = 95\nTotal value = 0 + 51 + 0 + 0 + 95 = 146\n\nSince 146 is much less than my outside offer of 1209, I should not accept this offer.\n\nNow, I need to consider whether to walk away or make a counteroffer. Since it is round 2, I should make a counteroffer. If I walk away, my value is 1209. If I make a counteroffer in round 2 and it is rejected, my value becomes 0.9 * 1209 = 1088.1. Thus it is not in my interest to simply make a counteroffer close to my true valuation.\n\nI have the following items:\n* Item 1: 2 units\n* Item 2: 5 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 1 unit\n* Item 5: 6 units\n\nI need to decide how to divide these. I want to maximize my value, so I need to consider what Player 1 might accept.\nThe total value of all items for me is 1223.\nMy values are: 82, 51, 75, 84, 95 for items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively.\nI'll try to offer player 1 close to their outside offer.\n\nI'll propose giving Player 1:\n* 2 units of item 1\n* 4 units of item 2\n* 2 units of item 3\n* 1 unit of item 4\n* 5 units of item 5\n\nThis means I keep:\n* 0 units of item 1\n* 1 units of item 2\n* 0 units of item 3\n* 0 units of item 4\n* 1 units of item 5\n\nMy value for this offer is: 1*51 + 1*95 = 146.\nThis is not good enough since it is lower than 1209.\nAlso, if Player 1 accepts this offer, the total value will be 146.\n\nLet's propose something closer to equal division.\nI offer to Player 1:\n* 1 unit of item 1\n* 2 units of item 2\n* 1 unit of item 3\n* 0 unit of item 4\n* 3 units of item 5\n\nThen I keep:\n* 1 unit of item 1\n* 3 unit of item 2\n* 1 unit of item 3\n* 1 unit of item 4\n* 3 unit of item 5\n\nThe value for this offer is: 1*82 + 3*51 + 1*75 + 1*84 + 3*95 = 82 + 153 + 75 + 84 + 285 = 679.\nSo I keep 679 and give away 1223 - 679 = 544.\nBut Player 1 will likely have values greater than 544 so this is not optimal.\n\nSince it's round 2, and I have a strong outside option, I'm going to make a counteroffer that is slightly better than my outside option after considering the discount factor to see if the other agent will accept it. Thus, I will counteroffer in the hope it is accepted.\nLet x be the value I offer to Player 1. My value then will be 1223 - x, which is my current total value less what I give to player 1. I require my discounted value in the next round to be greater than my outside option of 1209: 0.9 * (1223 - x) > 1209. So I get 1223 - x > 1209/0.9, 1223 - x > 1343.333... So, -x > 120.33, x < -120.33.\n\nThis is incorrect.\nMy value should be at least 1209/0.9 = 1343.33\nSo, I will try offering only the first item. 1223- (82*number items of type1 that i keep).\n\nLet me think about this. I want player one to accept.\n\nI will propose giving Player 1: [1, 2, 1, 0, 3]\nI keep [1, 3, 1, 1, 3]\nMy value = 82 + 3*51 + 75 + 84 + 3*95 = 82+153+75+84+285 = 679\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 0, 3]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 310. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 540 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 1, and there's no offer on the table. I need to make an initial offer to Player 2. My goal is to maximize my discounted value, considering my outside offer of 310.\n\nI need to decide on an offer that Player 2 might accept, but that also gives me a good value. I'll start by considering what a fair split might look like, and then adjust it to be more favorable to me while still being potentially acceptable to Player 2. I don'll use a Nash Bargaining Solution as a starting point, which is a 50-50 split of the gains above the outside offers.\n\nMy total value of all items is:\n3 * 100 + 1 * 11 + 2 * 60 + 3 * 1 + 4 * 8 = 300 + 11 + 120 + 3 + 32 = 466\n\nI don't know Player 2's values or outside offer, but I will assume that Player 2's values are also significant.\n\nI want to secure at least my outside option value in the negotiation, therefore I will calculate a possible offer to Player 2, that if accepted, would give me more than 310 value.\nTo do this, I will give Player 2 1 unit each of Item 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This gives me a starting point for negotiations.\n\nIf I give Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], my value would be:\nItem 1: (3-1) * 100 = 200\nItem 2: (1-1) * 11 = 0\nItem 3: (2-1) * 60 = 60\nItem 4: (3-1) * 1 = 2\nItem 5: (4-1) * 8 = 24\nTotal Value = 200 + 0 + 60 + 2 + 24 = 286\n\nSince this is less than my outside offer value of 310, I will adjust the offer to be more favorable to me and make a counteroffer that is only a little bit better than walking away. \n\nLet's try offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My value would be 466, much better than my outside offer. However, this has almost no chance of being accepted.\n\nLet me try to balance these two extremes. I will offer [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]. In this case, my value would be:\nItem 1: 3 * 100 = 300\nItem 2: 1 * 11 = 11\nItem 3: (2-1) * 60 = 60\nItem 4: (3-1) * 1 = 2\nItem 5: (4-1) * 8 = 24\n\nTotal: 300 + 11 + 60 + 2 + 24 = 397\n\nNow I will try offering [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]\nItem 1: 3 * 100 = 300\nItem 2: 1 * 11 = 11\nItem 3: (2-1) * 60 = 60\nItem 4: (3-1) * 1 = 2\nItem 5: (4-2) * 8 = 16\n\nTotal: 300 + 11 + 60 + 2 + 16 = 389\n\nOkay, this is getting closer to my outside offer. I will offer player 2 [0, 0, 1, 1, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1126. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since 505.8 < 1126, I should not accept this offer.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my expected value, taking into account the possibility that Player 2 will accept, reject, or walk away.\nSince it's round 2, and if player 2 makes a counteroffer in round 3, it is treated as a WALK, the game effectively ends after this round, so I should try to make a reasonable offer. I also need to take into account that player 2's values for items could be very different than mine.\n\nI will make an offer that gives Player 2 slightly more than what I'm getting now, in the hopes they accept.

This is indeed greater than 425, so it's a much better deal.\n\nSince I can get 563 compared to the 425 of the current offer, and it will only be discounted by 0.9 if it makes it to round 2, I should make the counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]}\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If I give Player 2 [1, 4, 3, 3, 4], I get:\n2 item 1\n1 item 2\n0 item 3\n1 item 4\n1 item 5\n\nThis is worth:\n2 * 33 + 1 * 73 + 0 * 16 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 67 = 66 + 73 + 0 + 4 + 67 = 210\nDiscounted value = 210 * 0.81 = 170.1\nThis is still less than my outside option.\n\nIn this final round, I think my best chance is to try and make an offer that splits it more evenly. If I give player 2 [1, 2, 1, 2, 2], I am giving them approximately half of the available quantity of items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

A simple starting point is to aim for an equal split of the total value.  Since I don't know Player 2's values, I will propose an offer that gives Player 2 items roughly in proportion to the available quantities.\n\nHere's my proposed initial offer to Player 2:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units\n*   Item 2: 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 0 units\n*   Item 4: 2 units\n*   Item 5: 2 units\n\nNow I must compute how many units of each item I keep.

Since the current offer (372) is significantly less than my outside offer (724), I should not accept it.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to figure out if there is an offer that Player 1 might accept that would be better for me than my outside offer, taking into account the discount factor of 0.9 in subsequent rounds.\nSince this is round 1, there is no discount factor yet.\n\nTo make a smart counteroffer, I need to estimate Player 1's preferences. Since I don't know Player 1's values, let's try to make a counteroffer that gives them a good portion of the high value items for me, and I keep the remaining high value items. Since item 1 and item 3 have high values for me, I will try to keep most of item 1 and item 3.\nThe total amount of each item is:\n* Item 1: 5\n* Item 2: 2\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 4\n* Item 5: 5\n\nLet's make a counteroffer that gives Player 1:\n* Item 1: 1\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 2\n* Item 5: 3\n\nThis means I would get:\n* Item 1: 4\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 2\n* Item 5: 2\n\nThe value of this offer to me is:\n(4 * 93) + (1 * 32) + (0 * 70) + (2 * 44) + (2 * 33) = 372 + 32 + 0 + 88 + 66 = 630\n\nNow let's offer them [1, 1, 0, 2, 3]. This leaves me with 4 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 2 of item 5. The value to me is (4 * 93) + (1 * 32) + (0 * 70) + (2 * 44) + (2 * 33) = 372 + 32 + 0 + 88 + 66 = 630. This is still lower than my outside option of 724.\n\nLet's try to give less to Player 1.\nLet's make a counteroffer that gives Player 1:\n* Item 1: 0\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 2\n* Item 5: 3\n\nThis means I would get:\n* Item 1: 5\n* Item 2: 2\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 2\n* Item 5: 2\n\nThe value of this offer to me is:\n(5 * 93) + (2 * 32) + (0 * 70) + (2 * 44) + (2 * 33) = 465 + 64 + 0 + 88 + 66 = 683\n\nThis is still less than my outside option of 724.\n\nSince it is the first round, and the current offer is significantly lower than my outside offer, I will make a counteroffer, but if I have to keep making counteroffers in future rounds and discount that value, I am better off walking away now. I will make a counteroffer that is slightly better than my outside offer if Player 1 accepts.\n\nI will give Player 1 the minimum amount of items for me to just exceed my outside offer value if I keep the rest.\nIf I keep 5 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 5 of item 5:\n(5 * 93) + (2 * 32) + (0 * 70) + (4 * 44) + (5 * 33) = 465 + 64 + 0 + 176 + 165 = 870\n\nI need 724, so the difference is 146. Let's see what is the least amount of items I can give to Player 1 to achieve a value to me of 724.\n\nIf I give one of item 1 away, that is 93 less. 870 - 93 = 777\nIf I give one of item 2 away, that is 32 less. 870 - 32 = 838\nIf I give one of item 4 away, that is 44 less. 870 - 44 = 826\nIf I give one of item 5 away, that is 33 less. 870 - 33 = 837\n\nI can give Player 1 one of item 1, which leaves me with a value of 777.\nLet's offer Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

My goal is to get an agreement that's worth more than my outside offer of 436, considering the discount factor in later rounds. I need to offer Player 2 enough to incentivize them to accept, but not so much that I leave myself with less than my outside offer.\n\nA good strategy here is to estimate the total value of all items. This is:\n(5 * 12) + (5 * 25) + (2 * 97) + (9 * 36) + (2 * 70) = 60 + 125 + 194 + 324 + 140 = 843.\n\nSince I don't know Player 2's values, I can start by aiming for an equal split and then adjusting based on future rounds. If we split everything evenly (or as close as possible), Player 2 would get:\n\n*   Item 1: 2.5\n*   Item 2: 2.5\n*   Item 3: 1\n*   Item 4: 4.5\n*   Item 5: 1\n\nSince I can't offer fractions of items, I'll round my offer down for items 1, 2, and 4. This implies that I will take the additional units. I will offer exactly the stated units for items 3 and 5 as I have exactly 2 of each item.\n*   Item 1: 2\n*   Item 2: 2\n*   Item 3: 1\n*   Item 4: 4\n*   Item 5: 1\n\nThis leaves me with:\n\n*   Item 1: 3\n*   Item 2: 3\n*   Item 3: 1\n*   Item 4: 5\n*   Item 5: 1\n\nMy value for these items is:\n(3 * 12) + (3 * 25) + (1 * 97) + (5 * 36) + (1 * 70) = 36 + 75 + 97 + 180 + 70 = 458\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer, so this offer is worth making.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 4, 1]}\n```",
