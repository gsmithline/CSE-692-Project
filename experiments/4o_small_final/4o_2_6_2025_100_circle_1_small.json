In the first round, there is no discount (gamma to the power of 0 is 1), so I should seek a deal valuing more than 54.\n\nNow, let's think about a reasonable initial offer to Player 2. A strategic way is to try and retain the most valuable items (to me) and players often value different items differently. By giving away more of the items that are less valuable to me, I can maximize what I retain.\n\nBased on my values, I prefer to keep more item 4 as it is the most valuable to me. Other items, especially item 3, are less valuable.\n\nHere's a possible initial offer maximizing my value:\n\n- Offer 0 units of item 1\n- Offer 3 units of item 2\n- Offer 3 units of item 3\n- Offer 2 units of item 4\n- Offer 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis means I offer Player 2: [0, 3, 3, 2, 1]\n\nLet's calculate the value I get by keeping the rest:\n- I keep 2 units of item 1 at a value of 7 each: \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\)\n- I keep 3 units of item 2 at a value of 5 each: \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n- I keep 1 unit of item 3 at a value of 3 each: \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\)\n- I keep 3 units of item 4 at a value of 10 each: \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\)\n- I keep 1 unit of item 5 at a value of 7 each: \\(1 \\times 7 = 7\\)\n\nTotal kept value = \\(14 + 15 + 3 + 30 + 7 = 69\\).\n\n69 is higher than my outside offer of 54, so this is a reasonable deal for the first round without factoring any discounts yet.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 3, 2, 1]}",

Since player 2's offer leaves me with a value below my outside offer, I will try a counteroffer first.\n\n### Counteroffer Proposal\n\nI will create a counteroffer that slightly adjusts from my initial offer [0, 3, 3, 2, 1] to try and increase my value:\n\n- I offered 3 units of item 2. Retaining more higher value items for myself is beneficial, so I can offer: `[0, 4, 2, 2, 1]`, thereby getting more units of item 3 since they're more valuable to me.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe counteroffer aims to strike a better balance between the two offers we have seen, potentially acting as a compromise.

A good starting strategy is to keep high-value items while offering a reasonable division to encourage acceptance or a favorable counteroffer.\n\nMy values indicate item 5 is the most valuable to me, so I seek to keep a substantial part of it.

After 1 round, my required minimum utility remains 45, as it is still Round 1, and gamma's effect isn't yet applied.\n\n5. **Offer Construction:**\n   - I should aim to retain items that maximize my utility while ensuring the offer is reasonable enough for Player 2 to consider some value.\n   - To retain maximum utility, I should prioritize keeping the high-value items for myself: Items 1 and 2. I can be more flexible with Items 3, 4, and 5 because they contribute less to my overall utility.\n\n6. **Proposed Initial Offer:**\n   - Offer to Player 2:\n     - 0 units of item 1 (value for me = 7, so I keep all)\n     - 1 units of item 2 (value for me = 5 per unit)\n     - 2 units of item 3 (value for me = 1 per unit)\n     - 3 units of item 4 (value for me = 3 per unit)\n     - 4 units of item 5 (value for me = 1 per unit)\n\n7. **Expected Outcome of the Offer:**\n   - I retain:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 14\n     - 4 units of item 2 = 20\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 9\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1\n     - Total retained value = 44\n\nThis offer should give me a total utility of 44, which is slightly less than my outside offer.

I need to negotiate to get more than this value, considering the discount factor, to make it worth accepting an agreement.\n\nWhile I don't know Player 2's values, I should start by prioritizing the higher-value items for myself, especially item 2 and item 3, and leave more of the lower-value items for Player 2.\n\nTo maximize my offer while being attractive enough to Player 2, I could try offering:\n\n- Fewer of high-value items for me (like items 2 and 3)\n- More of the lower-value items for me to items 4 and 5\n\nLet me propose the following offer:\n\n- Offer 1 unit of item 1\n- Offer 2 unit of item 2\n- Offer 1 unit of item 3\n- Offer 2 units of item 4\n- Offer 2 units of item 5\n\nThis means I'll keep:\n\n- 1 unit of item 1 (value 1)\n- 2 units of item 2 (value 20)\n- 2 units of item 3 (value 16)\n- 4 units of item 4 (value 28)\n- 2 units of item 5 (value 2)\n\nThe total value I would receive is \\(1 + 20 + 16 + 28 + 2 = 67\\).\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer value of 99 when accounting for the discount in subsequent rounds, but it's an initial negotiation and can be adjusted based on Player 2's response.

My value for this is 7 per unit, so my value = 2 * 7 = 14.\n- **Item 5**: 2 units to me, 2 units to Player 2. My value for this is 1 per unit, so my value = 2 * 1 = 2.\n\nTotal value from the current offer = 0 + 20 + 24 + 14 + 2 = 60.\n\n### Round Discounting:\nIt's now round 2, so the present value of this offer considering the discounting factor (gamma) will be:\nDiscounted value = 60 * (0.9)^1 = 60 * 0.9 = 54.\n\n### Comparing to Outside Offer:\nIt's crucial to compare this with my outside offer value, which is 99.\n- The discounted value of the current offer (54) is much less than my outside offer (99).\n\n### New Counteroffer Strategy:\nGiven the low value of the current offer relative to my outside offer, I should construct a counteroffer that aims to maximize my value closer to my total possible value, avoiding offering Player 2 too much value of high importance to me (items 2 and 3):\n\n1. Keep more higher-value items (Items 2, 3) with me.\n2. Give more of the less valuable items (Items 1, 5) to balance the offer.\n\nA potential counteroffer could be:\n- **Item 1**: Give 0 units to Player 2.\n- **Item 2**: Give 1 unit to Player 2.\n- **Item 3**: Give 0 units to Player 2.\n- **Item 4**: Give 3 units to Player 2.\n- **Item 5**: Give 3 units to Player 2.\n\nNew counteroffer: [0, 1, 0, 3, 3].\n\n### Calculating My Value with the Counteroffer:\n- **Item 1**: 2 to me, 0 to Player 2, Value = 2 * 1 = 2.\n- **Item 2**: 3 to me, 1 to Player 2, Value = 3 * 10 = 30.\n- **Item 3**: 3 to me, 0 to Player 2, Value = 3 * 8 = 24.\n- **Item 4**: 3 to me, 3 to Player 2, Value = 3 * 7 = 21.\n- **Item 5**: 1 to me, 3 to Player 2, Value = 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nTotal value from my counteroffer = 2 + 30 + 24 + 21 + 1 = 78.\n\nDiscounted value in Round 3 would be 78 * (0.9)^2 = 78 * 0.81 = 63.18, which is over 60% of my outside offer, potentially giving Player 2 an incentive to settle if their outside offer is much lower.\n\nSince even after discounting in round 3 this is higher than 54, the negotiation might be worth pursuing with a better offer.

Then, I'll determine the best course of action.\n\n### Current Offer Evaluation\n\nThe current offer from Player 2 is: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This means they are offering me:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy private values per unit are:\n- Item 1: 5\n- Item 2: 9\n- Item 3: 4\n- Item 4: 7\n- Item 5: 10\n\nSo, the value of the offered items to me, considering my valuation is:\n- Value of item 1: 1 * 5 = 5\n- Value of item 2: 0 * 9 = 0\n- Value of item 3: 0 * 4 = 0\n- Value of item 4: 1 * 7 = 7\n- Value of item 5: 1 * 10 = 10\n\nTotal value from the current offer = 5 + 0 + 0 + 7 + 10 = 22\n\n### Adjusted Value of the Current Offer\n\nSince we are in round 2 and the discount rate is 0.9, I will adjust this total value:\n- Adjusted value = 22 * (0.9^(2-1)) = 22 * 0.9 = 19.8\n\n### Comparison to Outside Offer\n\nMy outside offer is valued at 94. Since 19.8 is significantly less than 94, the current offer is not favorable compared to my outside option.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy\n\nGiven that the current offer is considerably less than my outside offer, I should attempt to make a counteroffer that maximizes my value. I'll aim for a higher distribution of items with high value for me, primarily targeting items 2, 4, and 5 given their higher valuation.\n\nCounteroffer: \n- I'll give Player 2: [0, 0, 3, 1, 3]\n  - This means I keep: [3, 1, 2, 1, 4]\n\nValue of items I keep:\n- Item 1: 3 * 5 = 15\n- Item 2: 1 * 9 = 9\n- Item 3: 2 * 4 = 8\n- Item 4: 1 * 7 = 7\n- Item 5: 4 * 10 = 40\n\nTotal value to me = 15 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 40 = 79\n\nAdjusting for round 2 discount:\n- Adjusted total value = 79 * 0.9 = 71.1\n\nThis is still below my outside offer, but it is a more favorable distribution that aligns closer to maximizing potential gains. I'll proceed with this counteroffer, hoping Player 2 finds it reasonable given their private valuations.\n\n### Action\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 1, 3]}\n```",

Therefore, the present value is the same as calculated above: 28.\n\n5. **Comparison with My Outside Offer**: My outside offer is 52, which is higher than the current offer value of 28.\n\n6. **Decision**: Since the current offer value of 28 is significantly less than my outside offer of 52, it makes sense to not accept the current offer and instead propose a counteroffer that reflects a better value for me. I want to ensure I exceed the value of my outside offer or get a reasonable distribution that could potentially reach it after considering the discount in future rounds.\n\n7. **Propose a Counteroffer**: Let's try a counteroffer which gives Player 1:\n   - 2 units of Item 1 (keeping 3 for myself since it's a moderate value)\n   - 0 unit of Item 2 (I don't value this item as highly)\n   - 0 units of Item 3 (I highly value this, so will keep it)\n   - 1 unit of Item 4 (I will keep 1 as I value these more)\n   - 1 unit of Item 5 (of higher value to me, so I prefer more)\n\nBy doing this, I am targeting to hold more of the items I value highly to potentially reach my outside offer's value.\n\nHere is my action based on this reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Offer enough less valuable items to secure a favorable outcome.\n\n#### Proposal\n- Offer Player 2 all units of items with the least value to me, but retain significant amounts of high-value items:\n  - Item 1: Offer 6 units (keeping 2 units for 8 value to me)\n  - Item 2: Offer 2 units (keeping 4 units for 32 value to me)\n  - Item 3: Offer 4 units (keeping 0 units for 0 value to me)\n  - Item 4: Offer 1 unit (keeping 2 units for 16 value to me)\n  - Item 5: Offer 3 units (keeping 2 units for 2 value to me)\n\nRemaining value = 8 (Item 1) + 32 (Item 2) + 0 (Item 3) + 16 (Item 4) + 2 (Item 5) = 58, which is not ideal.\n\nAdjust the offer by retaining more high-value items:\n\n- Item 1: Offer 4 units (keeping 4 units for 16 value to me)\n- Item 2: Offer 1 unit (keeping 5 units for 40 value to me)\n- Item 3: Offer 4 units (keeping 0 units for 0 value to me)\n- Item 4: Offer 0 units (keeping 3 units for 24 value to me)\n- Item 5: Offer 3 units (keeping 2 units for 2 value to me)\n\nRemaining value = 16 (Item 1) + 40 (Item 2) + 0 (Item 3) + 24 (Item 4) + 2 (Item 5) = 82, still short of 110 total.\n\nFinal adjustment to offer:\n\n- Item 1: Offer 5 units (keeping 3 units for 12 value to me)\n- Item 2: Offer 1 unit (keeping 5 units for 40 value to me)\n- Item 3: Offer 4 units (keeping 0 units for 0 value to me)\n- Item 4: Offer 0 units (keeping 3 units for 24 value to me)\n- Item 5: Offer 3 units (keeping 2 units for 2 value to me)\n\nNew remaining value = 12 (Item 1) + 40 (Item 2) + 0 (Item 3) + 24 (Item 4) + 2 (Item 5) = 78, with adjustments needed:\nOffer:\n- Item 1: 6 units; Item 2: 2 units; Item 3: 4 units; Item 4: 0 units; Item 5: 2 units\n\nI will make this initial counteroffer in order to see if the process can begin positively.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 2, 4, 0, 2]}",

Since 78 (current offer's value) is greater than 15 (outside offer), accepting the current offer would give me a higher value than walking away right now.\n\n### Strategy Consideration\nWhile the current offer is valuable, I should also consider if I can make a more beneficial counteroffer. However, given the high value already and since it maximizes our expected utility beyond the outside offer significantly, this round's offer seems fair.\n\n### Decision\nGiven that the current offer (78) is substantially greater than my outside offer (15) and given the diminishing returns with each round (discount factor), I will accept the current offer to maximize my value without risk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This emphasizes the importance of maximizing the offer to match or surpass this value.\n\nIn the absence of an offer from Player 2, I need to strategically offer the other player certain units to ensure that my resultant value exceeds my outside offer, considering the potential negotiation rounds where the discounting occurs. \n\nMy strategy should ensure that I receive high-value items while giving away those which are less valuable to me:\n\n1.

Item 3: Moderate value; consider giving 1 to Player 2 (6 per unit).\n4. Item 4: High value, keep most; consider giving 1 to Player 2 (7 per unit).\n5. Item 5: Low value; ok to offer all to Player 2 (total 3).\n\nA fair starting offer to maximize my retained value could be:\n\n- Offer 0 units of Item 1\n- Offer 0 units of Item 2\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 3 (I retain 1)\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 4 (I retain 4)\n- Offer 3 units of Item 5 (I retain 0)\n\nThis offer results in:\n- Value kept: 8 (Item 1) + 36 (Item 2) + 6 (Item 3) + 28 (4 units of Item 4) + 0 (Item 5) = 78\n- With consideration for the discount rate, this falls short of my outside offer, but it also reflects a strong opening position to potentially initiate negotiation.\n\nTo make the offer more attractive without reducing my retained value excessively, it might be strategic to see if player 2 perceives greater value from certain items, which they might if the counter offer is reached in negotiation.\n\nThus, my initial offer to Player 2 is:\n- Item 1: 0\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 3\n\nThis opening offer aligns with my strategy of leveraging higher value retained, providing a platform to negotiate towards maximizing value beyond my outside offer. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 3]}\n```",

This means Player 1 proposes they take 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\n2. **Calculating My Value for the Offer**:\n   - My values per unit: Item 1 = 9, Item 2 = 3, Item 3 = 4, Item 4 = 3, Item 5 = 6.\n   - With the current offer, I receive: \n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 9 = 9\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 3 = 3\n     - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 4 = 8\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 3 = 3\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 6 = 6\n   - Total value from this offer = 9 + 3 + 8 + 3 + 6 = 29.\n\n3. **Outside Offer Consideration**:\n   - My outside offer is 62. Even with the discount rate factored in after the first round, the outside offer is significantly higher.\n   - Discount factor after round 1: \\( \\gamma^0 = 1 \\).\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - The offer on the table only gives me a value of 29, which is far less than my guaranteed outside offer of 62.\n   - Accepting this offer is not beneficial compared to walking away.\n\n5. **Potential Counteroffer**:\n   - To improve my position, I must propose a counteroffer that gives me a value higher than or at least close to my outside offer. However, given the high value of my outside offer, it seems more advantageous to aim for close negotiation first and only accept an offer that meets or exceeds the adjusted outside offer value after applying discounts over future rounds.\n\nGiven that the current offer value is considerably lower than my outside offer, I will choose to WALK away from the negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Current Offer Value Calculation:**\n   - The current offer from Player 1 gives me:\n     - 0 units of item 1 (value per unit = 7) \u2192 Total value = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 2 (value per unit = 3) \u2192 Total value = 3\n     - 1 unit of item 3 (value per unit = 3) \u2192 Total value = 3\n     - 0 units of item 4 (value per unit = 6) \u2192 Total value = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5 (value per unit = 1) \u2192 Total value = 0\n   - Total value of current offer = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. **Present Value with Discount Rate:**\n   - Since it is round 2, the discount factor is \\(0.9^{2-1} = 0.9\\).\n   - Present value of the offer = 6 * 0.9 = 5.4\n\n3. **Outside Offer:**\n   - My outside offer is worth 42.\n\n4. **Comparison:**\n   - The current offer's present value (5.4) is significantly lower than my outside offer value (42).\n\n5. **Strategy:**\n   - Since my outside offer is much higher than the present value of any currently proposed deal, I should not accept the current offer, and it would be optimal to walk away if no better offer is achieved.\n   - However, I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer that can still maximize my items' value.\n\n6. **Formulate a Counteroffer:**\n   - Based on Player 1's offers, they might be interested in item 2, as they consistently request it.\n   - I will construct a counteroffer aiming to maximize my value:\n     - 2 units of item 1 to me\n     - 2 units of item 2 to Player 1 (high priority as they have shown interest)\n     - 1 unit of item 3 to me\n     - 1 unit of item 4 to me\n   \n   Therefore, I offer Player 1:\n   - 0 of item 1\n   - 2 of item 2\n   - 0 of item 3\n   - 0 of item 4\n   - 1 of item 5\n   \nThis gives me the items with the highest worth to try to capture enough value to compete with my outside offer.\n\nGiven this, my next action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 1]}",

My highest valued items are item 3, followed by item 4 and item 5.\n   - Offer Player 1: [3, 3, 1, 2, 2] which leaves me with: [3, 3, 4, 3, 2]\n     * Here I give away one more unit of items 1 and 2 and decrease the units of item 3 to Player 1. I also offer two units of item 4 to make the deal fairer to Player 1.\n\n5. **Value Calculation for My Counteroffer**:\n   - My value: (3 * 2) + (3 * 1) + (4 * 6) + (3 * 3) + (2 * 3) = 6 + 3 + 24 + 9 + 6 = 48.\n\nThis gives me a value higher than the outside offer of 41, ensuring that I have improved my situation, while still allowing Player 1 to potentially find the offer acceptable.\n\nTherefore, my action is to propose this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

Initially, I would offer fewer valuable items from my perspective and adjust based on Player 2\u2019s response. Given my outside option is 39, any in-game offer that gives me a higher adjusted present value should be better.\n\n4. **Initial Offers:**\n\n   I should start by making an offer that prioritizes holding onto items of value to me (like items 2 and 4) more and offering Player 2 relatively more of the items valued lower by myself (items 1, 3, and 5).\n\n5. **Define Initial Offer:**\n\n   - Offer 2 units of item 1 (12 value for me)\n   - Offer 1 unit of item 2 (10 value for me)\n   - Offer 2 units of item 3 (4 value for me)\n   - Offer 1 unit of item 4 (9 value for me)\n   - Offer 3 units of item 5 (6 value for me)\n   \n   Value for me from remaining items = \n   - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 6 = 12\n   - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 10 = 30\n   - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 2 = 2\n   - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 9 = 18\n   - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 2 = 8\n\n   Total value from remaining = 12 + 30 + 2 + 18 + 8 = 70\n\n   This offer allows me to have 70 compared to my outside offer of 39, while trying to balance what I keep vs. what I might offer.\n\nHere's my calculated action as an offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 1, 3]}\n```",

However, considering negotiation dynamics, if Player 2 made a counteroffer that concedes more to me, it indicates they have a certain valuation allowing flexibility in their demands. Any counter could destabilize this favorable positioning without guaranteeing improvement beyond 72.9, especially if Player 2 also values the remaining items (especially item 4 and 5) highly enough to reject or counter less favorably for me.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe current offer provides a significantly higher value than my reservation value (outside offer), and further negotiations, given the values provided, could risk losing this advantageous position or lead to them walking away.\n\nTherefore, the strategic decision is to:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Since 25 < 75, this offer doesn't meet my outside offer value and isn't preferable.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that the value of the current offer (25) is less than my outside offer of 75, it's in my best interest to make a counteroffer. I will aim for an offer resulting in a total value closer to or exceeding my outside offer, taking into account the item values.\n\nI will offer Player 1 an allocation that allows me to secure an outcome value better than 75 when the discount is applied at the end of the negotiation. Let's propose a more balanced allocation that increases my retention in valuable items:\n\n**Counteroffer:**\n\n- 1 unit of item 1 to Player 1\n- 0 units of item 2 to Player 1\n- 1 unit of item 3 to Player 1\n- 2 units of item 4 to Player 1\n- 0 units of item 5 to Player 1\n\n**Calculating my retained values:**\n\nItems I'll keep:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 * 5 = 10 \n- 5 units of item 2: 5 * 9 = 45\n- 0 units of item 3: 0\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 1 = 1\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 * 5 = 20\n\nTotal value to me: 10 + 45 + 0 + 1 + 20 = 76\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a total value of 76, which is greater than my outside offer of 75 and preferable under the current discount structure.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]}\n```",

Let\u2019s keep all items with higher value to maximize my opportunity.\n\n**Revised Offer:**\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 2 units of Item 2\n  - 1 unit of Item 4\n  - 1 unit of Item 5\n\nCalculating again:\n- Retained:\n  - Item 1: 5 * 9 = 45\n  - Item 2: 3 * 7 = 21\n  - Item 3: 3 * 8 = 24\n  - Item 4: 0 * 6 = 0\n  - Item 5: 2 * 6 = 12\n- Total Retained Value = 45 + 21 + 24 + 0 + 12 = 102\n\nAgain this total is still too low.

Calculate my total value if I got all the items:\n   - Item 1: 2 units * 8 = 16\n   - Item 2: 5 units * 5 = 25\n   - Item 3: 2 units * 4 = 8\n   - Item 4: 2 units * 9 = 18\n   - Item 5: 3 units * 1 = 3\n   - Total value = 16 + 25 + 8 + 18 + 3 = 70\n\n4. My outside offer value is 28. Therefore, the deal I negotiate should at minimum have a present value of 28. But considering future rounds and the discount factor (0.9), I should aim for a bit more. Initially ensuring a present value of at least 28 in concessions is safe.\n\n5. For my opening offer, I will allocate:\n   - 0 of Item 1 to me (as each unit is highly valued to me)\n   - 2 of Item 2 to them (valued less by me, possibly valuable to them)\n   - 0 of Item 3 to me (constructed as a perceived fair split)\n   - 0 of Item 4 to me (also heavily valued by me)\n   - 1 of Item 5 to them (as its value is low to me)\n\nBy allocating the lower-value items or splitting medium-value items while retaining high-value items, I increase the chance for acceptance. However, I must consider a sufficient value offset to retain a strong position for accepting future adjusted offers.\n\n**My counteroffer to Player 2 would be:**\n\n- Offer Player 2: [0, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n\nThis offer values what I offer about ($2x5 + $1x4 + $1x1) = 11, reserved for them.

Since this is round 2:\n\nDiscounted current offer value = 33 * (0.9)^1 = 29.7\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe discounted value of the current offer (29.7) is still less than my outside offer (44). Hence, accepting the current offer is not beneficial.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy\n\nTo make a counteroffer that could potentially gain a better outcome, I would aim to yield the less valuable items and obtain the more valuable ones, improving my total value to ideally above the outside offer, post discounting. Therefore, a reasonable counteroffer would attempt to give lower units of items I value less and keep more units of an item I value the most, which is Item 4.\n\nI have one more round after this to negotiate, indicating it's beneficial to try a counteroffer.\n\n#### Counteroffer Outline\n- Retain a higher share of the most valuable item: Item 4.\n\nFor example:\n- Offer: [5, 2, 3, 0, 2]\n\nLet's verify if the counteroffer could potentially yield a better value:\n\n1. Item 1: 1 unit x 1 = 1\n2. Item 2: 3 units x 3 = 9\n3. Item 3: 2 units x 2 = 4\n4. Item 4: 3 units x 7 = 21\n5.

Since the current offer's value of 32 is significantly lower than my outside offer, it's not worth accepting as is.\n\n3. **Discounting Effect:**\n   - We're in round 1, so there is no discount applied yet. Normally, discounting would make future rounds' offers less valuable, but the immediate focus is on the value comparison already described.\n\n4. **Counteroffer Strategy:**\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that increases my value significantly above the current offer and preferably closer to my outside offer of 82.\n   - Since I wasn't offered any of item 5, and it has a high value to me, I should aim to secure as much of it as possible. I also need to capture more of item 1 due to its high value.\n\n5. **Formulate a Counteroffer:**\n   - I keep more of items valuable to me (items 1 and 5).\n   - Counter Offer: I choose to offer Player 1 a lesser amount of items 1 and 5.\n\nLet's form a valid counteroffer that improves my value positioning:\n\nCurrent possessions: \n- Item 1: 8\n- Item 2: 4\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 6\n- Item 5: 2\n\nProposed counteroffer:\n- Item 1: 2 to Player 1 (keep 6)\n- Item 2: 2 to Player 1 (keep 2)\n- Item 3: 1 to Player 1 (keep 1)\n- Item 4: 3 to Player 1 (keep 3)\n- Item 5: 1 to Player 1 (keep 1)\n\nFormed counter offer: [2, 2, 1, 3, 1]\n\nGiven these allocations, the value to me becomes significantly better while retaining a fair approach.

Let's break down the current offer, my outside offer, and any possible counteroffers:\n\n### Current Offer Analysis\nPlayer 1 is offering me:\n- 2 units of item 1, valued at 10 each: 2 * 10 = 20\n- 1 unit of item 2, valued at 10 each: 1 * 10 = 10\n- 1 unit of item 3, valued at 2 each: 1 * 2 = 2\n- 0 units of item 4, valued at 1 each: 0 * 1 = 0\n- 4 units of item 5, valued at 8 each: 4 * 8 = 32\n\nThe total value of the current offer to me is 20 + 10 + 2 + 0 + 32 = 64.\n\n### Outside Offer\nMy outside offer is valued at 64.\n\n### Comparison\nThe current offer gives me a total value of 64, equivalent to my outside offer. Thus, accepting provides no better result than walking away, given my private outside offer value.\n\n### Potential Counteroffer Strategy\n- I should aim for an offer providing a value greater than 64.\n- One strategy might be holding back low-value items for me (like item 3 or 4) while trying to gain more of high-value items (like item 1, 2, or 5).\n\nCurrent allocation available:\n- 5 units of item 1\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 7 units of item 5\n\nConsider reversing some allocation:\n- Ask for 3 units of item 1 and 2 more units of item 5.\n\n### Proposed Counteroffer\nLet's make the following proposed counteroffer:\n- 2 units of item 1 for Player 1 (I take 3 units)\n- 1 unit of item 2 for Player 1 (I take 3 units)\n- 1 unit of item 3 for Player 1 (I take 2 units)\n- 0 units of item 4 (remains unchanged)\n- 3 units of item 5 for Player 1 (I take 4 units)\n\nConsequently, this counteroffer leaves me with:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 * 10 = 30\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 * 10 = 30\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 * 2 = 4\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 * 1 = 0\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 * 8 = 32\n\nNew total value = 30 + 30 + 4 + 0 + 32 = 96, which is greater than 64.\n\nThus, I propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 0, 3]}\n```",

However, from round 2 onward, any delay in agreement will reduce the effective value I receive by 10% each round.\n\n5. **Strategy for the Initial Offer**: My goal is to maximize my value while providing an acceptable initial offer to Player 2. Ideally, I want to retain high-value items and offer lower-value items to Player 2.\n\nBased on this, I should aim to keep all high-value items as much as possible (specifically Items 3 and 4, where I derive the highest value). I am more willing to trade items with low value for me (Items 2 and 5).\n\n6. **Constructing the Offer**: \n   - I will keep all units of Item 3 (high value to me).\n   - I will offer 2 units of Item 1, as keeping 3 will still give me a decent portion of the value.\n   - I will offer all units of Item 2 (very low value to me) and 3 units of Item 5 (slightly low value).\n   - I will keep 2 units of Item 4 to maintain a solid value but offer 1 to show I'm willing to negotiate.\n\nThus, my initial offer will be:\n\n- Item 1: Offer 2 units to Player 2 (keep 3)\n- Item 2: Offer all 4 units to Player 2\n- Item 3: Offer 0 units to Player 2 (keep 3)\n- Item 4: Offer 1 unit to Player 2 (keep 2)\n- Item 5: Offer 3 units to Player 2 (keep 2)\n\nSo, my offer to Player 2 is [2, 4, 0, 1, 3]. \n\nThis will help in achieving a total value that exceeds my outside offer, considering both my retention and potential acceptance by Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 0, 1, 3]}\n```",

However, a deal needs a higher value than my outside offer of 115, adjusted for discounting.\n\n5. **Strategy:**\n   - In the first round, the discount factor doesn't affect the value (since it's the first round), so my task is to propose a division where I get more than 115 in present value.\n   - Given the total value is 121, I need at least 116 in value from the distribution to be worth more than the walk away value of 115.\n\nTo achieve a counteroffer that ensures my value exceeds 115, I want a substantial portion of the high-value items (item 3, specifically) and propose the following division:\n\n- **Offer to Player 2:**\n  - Item 1: 0 units (they add less immediate value considering my high requirement)\n  - Item 2: 0 units\n  - Item 3: 2 units (keeping more of this for myself given its high value to me)\n  - Item 4: 5 units (full quantity given away since its low value to me)\n  - Item 5: 0 units\n\n- **My Expected Value from This Offer:**\n  - I keep 5 units of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 6 units of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5.\n  - Value to me: (5 * 5) + (2 * 4) + (6 * 9) + (0 * 2) + (2 * 3) = 25 + 8 + 54 + 0 + 6 = 93\n\nThis offer ensures that between my share and the impact of discounting, my value remains competitive compared to my outside option. Hence, my counteroffer tries to balance reaching a deal while maximizing my share. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 5, 0]}\n```",

Here, total available items are needed for the counteroffer:\n\n- Item 1: 6 - total available units\n- Item 2: 3 - total units\n- Item 3: 5 - total available\n- Item 4: 5 - total available\n- Item 5: 2 - total available\n\nI'll propose the following allocation based on my value priorities and remaining items:\n\n- I give Player 1: [3, 1, 0, 3, 0]\n\n  - Remaining Available Calculation:\n    - Item 1: 6 - 3 = 3 units for me\n    - Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units for me\n    - Item 3: 5 - 0 = 5 units for me\n    - Item 4: 5 - 3 = 2 units for me\n    - Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 units for me\n\n#### My Value with Proposed Distribution\n- Value from item 1: 3 units * 6 = 18\n- Value from item 2: 2 units * 2 = 4\n- Value from item 3: 5 units * 9 = 45\n- Value from item 4: 2 units * 3 = 6\n- Value from item 5: 2 units * 9 = 18\n- Total Immediate Value: 18 + 4 + 45 + 6 + 18 = 91\n\n#### Adjusted Value with Discount Factor (Round 2)\n- Adjusted Value = 91 * 0.9 = 81.9\n\nThis proposed offer brings the adjusted value slightly closer to my outside offer, considering the negotiation ends this round if the counteroffer is rejected. An aggressive stance is needed.\n\n### Decision\n- Propose the counteroffer as it maximizes potential value better than the current offer while being mindful of the must-end condition.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

Compare the value of the offer with my outside offer:\n   - My outside offer value is 102.\n\n3. Given the discount factor gamma = 0.9, acceptances in later rounds would mean the present value of the items received reduces. Since it is round 1, the present value won't be affected by the gamma factor yet.\n\n4. Since the current offer value (79) is significantly less than my outside offer value (102), accepting this offer is not beneficial.\n\nTo improve my position, I can propose a counteroffer where I aim to get a better value closer to 102. One strategy is to ask for more units from the items that have higher value for me, specifically items 2, 3, and 4. However, I also have to leave player 1 with an acceptable offer for them to consider it better than their outside offer.\n\nOne possible counteroffer is:\n- Take fewer items of lower value to me (item 1).\n- Take a significant number of valuable items (items 2, 3, and 4) with a balance.\n\nLet's formulate a counteroffer:\n- I'll offer player 1: [4, 1, 1, 4, 0]\n\nItems remaining for me would be:\n- Item 1: 6 - 4 = 2 units\n- Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n- Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n- Item 4: 6 - 4 = 2 units\n- Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n\nCalculate the value for me for this counteroffer:\n- Item 1: 2 units * 1 = 2\n- Item 2: 2 units * 8 = 16\n- Item 3: 2 units * 9 = 18\n- Item 4: 2 units * 10 = 20\n- Item 5: 1 unit * 4 = 4\n\nTotal value = 2 + 16 + 18 + 20 + 4 = 60\n\nThis value of 60 is still less than my outside offer, but it may be more acceptable considering negotiation dynamics compared to their prior offer. However, it might not be feasible to make an offer better than their outside offer if significantly higher. This step involves assuming they find a new value close enough to concede later as rounds progress.\n\nGiven this rationale, I will make this counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 1, 4, 0]}",

The trade-off is that accepting now gives me an immediate payoff at round 1 with no discount. However, my outside offer is already larger than the present offer value. Since I need at least 42 in value to make it worth accepting, I need to make a counteroffer that maximizes my value without being rejected outright.\n\nBased on my private valuations, I wish to maximize my units of items 1, 2, and to a lesser extent, 5, since these provide the highest values. I can afford to give away more of item 3 and 4, where my valuations are low.\n\nPropose a counteroffer: Give Player 1 more of the items I value least, thus increasing my share of high-valued items:\n\n- Counteroffer to Player 1: [0, 1, 5, 2, 4]\n  - This increases my aforementioned items.\n  - Remaining units for me (since there are 5, 4, 7, 4, 6 respectively in stock):\n    - Item 1: 5 (5 total - 0 offered)\n    - Item 2: 3 (4 total - 1 offered)\n    - Item 3: 2 (7 total - 5 offered)\n    - Item 4: 2 (4 total - 2 offered)\n    - Item 5: 2 (6 total - 4 offered)\n\n- Calculate my value for the remaining units:\n  - Item 1: 5 * 7 = 35\n  - Item 2: 3 * 10 = 30\n  - Item 3: 2 * 1 = 2\n  - Item 4: 2 * 1 = 2\n  - Item 5: 2 * 3 = 6\n\n  Total value with counteroffer = 35 + 30 + 2 + 2 + 6 = 75\n\nEven with the discount in future rounds, a higher initial value gives me more room to negotiate and avoids ending with less than my outside offer.

We can either walk away or propose a counteroffer that improves our situation. To make a counteroffer, let's try to increase our total value closer to or above our outside offer when considering the discount rate.\n\nTo achieve a value at least equal to the outside offer with discount consideration, we need a target value of at least \\( \\frac{35}{0.9} \\approx 38.89 \\) in this round.\n\n5. **Propose a New Counteroffer**:\n   - Let's construct a more favorable offer to maximize our received item's value:\n     - Item 1: Offer 1 unit (keep 1 unit for ourselves)\n     - Item 2: Offer 0 units (keep both units for ourselves for 14 value)\n     - Item 3: Offer 2 units (keep 3 units for ourselves, for 30 value)\n     - Item 4: Offer 3 units (keep 2 units for ourselves, for 10 value)\n     - Item 5: Offer 0 units (keep 3 units for ourselves, for 21 value)\n\nCalculating the value we would get from our suggested counteroffer:\n\n- Item 1: 1 unit * 5 value/unit = 5\n- Item 2: 2 units * 7 value/unit = 14\n- Item 3: 3 units * 10 value/unit = 30\n- Item 4: 2 units * 5 value/unit = 10\n- Item 5: 3 units * 7 value/unit = 21\n- New Total Value = 5 + 14 + 30 + 10 + 21 = 80\n\nLet's finalize this counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 3, 0]}",

Therefore, the present value of this offer is:\n\\[ 42 \\times 0.9^{2-1} = 42 \\times 0.9 = 37.8 \\]\n\n### Comparing with Outside Offer\nMy outside offer value is 115. Compared to the discounted present value of 37.8 of the current offer, my outside offer is much higher.\n\n### Counteroffering Considerations\n\nIn round 2, any counteroffer from me should at least bring me close to the outside offer with the discount factored. However, after evaluating this current setup, I'm not likely to make a high enough gain in my favor given Player 1's previous offers focused heavily on high-value items for me, especially item 3 and item 5. They are unlikely to agree to a division that would possibly meet or exceed my outside offer after the final round adjustment, given they also need to maximize based on their own undisclosed values.\n\nGiven these calculations and strategic considerations, it makes sense to WALK rather than proceed with an unfavorable division or an uncertain counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

After applying the discount factor, it becomes 29 * 0.9 = 26.1, which is lower than my outside offer of 41.\n   - Therefore, accepting this offer is not beneficial as it doesn't exceed\u2014or even come close to\u2014my guaranteed fallback position of 41.\n\n7. **Strategy**:\n   - I need to make a counteroffer that could potentially be more acceptable to Player 2 while still giving me a higher value than accepting the current offer.\n   - My initial offer in Round 1 was [1, 0, 2, 3, 0], which was rejected by Player 2.\n   - The idea is to slightly increase what I offer in a resource that I value lower to incentivize Player 2 into considering my counteroffer, but not reduce my own value proposition below my outside offer requirement.\n   \n8. **Counteroffer Proposal**:\n   - Consider offering something slightly more appealing in one of the lesser-value areas to me.\n   - Possible Counteroffer: [1, 0, 2, 3, 0] remains but let's try [1, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n     - I receive: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n     - My value: (1 * 10) + (2 * 5) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 25\n     - Discounted: 25 * 0.9 = 22.5, so let's try something that ensures a value closer to my outside fallback.\n   \n   My goal in achieving a fair negotiation here is higher than 35 before discount adjustment.\n\nTo proceed, here's my new counteroffer:\n   \n   **Counteroffer**: [1, 0, 1, 3, 0] \n   - I receive: 1 of item 1, 3 item 3, 3 of item 4, 1 of item 5\n   - My value: (1 * 10) + (3 * 5) + (3 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 10 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 32\n   - Discounted: 32 * 0.9 = 28.8 (closer but increased emphasis on item 4 where original gets you more)\n\nThis slightly increases what I value more of three items while increasing our resources shared making this of a more balanced offer.\n\n9. **Conclusion**:\n   - I still aim for a better outcome than walking with an outside offer.\n   - Therefore, to continue ensuring negotiation with the best interest, I'll make a reasonable counter-offer reflecting a balanced satisfaction.\n\nMy counteroffer proposal:\n \n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 3, 0]}",

Given that my outside offer is 102, I should try to negotiate an outcome that provides a higher present value than this outside offer.\n\nHere is the breakdown of my value for each item type:\n\n- Item 1: 5 units available at a value of 10 each = 5 * 10 = 50\n- Item 2: 6 units available at a value of 2 each = 6 * 2 = 12\n- Item 3: 2 units available at a value of 7 each = 2 * 7 = 14\n- Item 4: 7 units available at a value of 1 each = 7 * 1 = 7\n- Item 5: 5 units available at a value of 9 each = 5 * 9 = 45\n\nTotal potential value from all items for me: 50 + 12 + 14 + 7 + 45 = 128\n\nTo beat my outside offer of 102 with certainty, I must ensure the deal provides a present value greater than 102. In the first round, I don't have to account for any discounting yet as my counteroffer is intended for immediate consideration.\n\nI'll propose a counteroffer that allows me to try achieving a value significantly higher than 102. Thus, I need to keep most of the high-value items (1 and 5). Here's a suggested initial offer to Player 2, designed to maximize my value while encouraging negotiation:\n\n- Offer 1 unit of item 1 to Player 2 (keeping 4)\n- Offer 5 units of item 2 to Player 2 (keeping 1)\n- Offer 1 unit of item 3 to Player 2 (keeping 1)\n- Offer 6 units of item 4 to Player 2 (keeping 1)\n- Offer 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2 (keeping 4)\n\nThis offer gives me:\n\n- Item 1: 4 units * 10 = 40\n- Item 2: 1 unit * 2 = 2\n- Item 3: 1 unit * 7 = 7\n- Item 4: 1 unit * 1 = 1\n- Item 5: 4 units * 9 = 36\n\nTotal value for me: 40 + 2 + 7 + 1 + 36 = 86\n\nThe present value for this is 86, which places it below 102. After considering the negotiation dynamics, I'll offer slightly higher units for items I value less (item 2 and item 4) to reach a better deal if Player 2 provides a counteroffer.\n\nGiven the need to find middle ground, this offer is a starting point to explore potential agreement while leaving me open to future counteroffers.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 1, 6, 1]}",

Let's propose:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of Item 1\n  - 2 units of Item 2 (full quantity, as it holds less value for me)\n  - 1 unit of Item 3\n  - 0 units of Item 4 (none are available)\n  - 3 units of Item 5\n\nThe value I retain with this offer:\n\n- Item 1: 4 units (I keep all) = 28\n- Item 2: 0 units (I give all) = 0\n- Item 3: 2 units (I keep remaining) = 4\n- Item 4: 0 units = 0\n- Item 5: 4 units (I keep remaining) = 12\n\nTotal retained value = 28 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 12 = 44\n\nThis retained value (44) is greater than my outside offer (33), making this an acceptable starting point to initiate the negotiations.\n\nTherefore, my initial counteroffer to Player 2 will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 0, 3]}\n```",

Calculate the Discounted Value of Accepting the Offer:**\n\nSince it is round 2, the gamma factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9, making the present value of the offer = 39 * 0.9 = 35.1\n\n**3. Compare with Outside Offer:**\n\nMy outside offer is 55. Since 35.1 is less than 55, accepting this offer yields less value compared to my outside offer.\n\n**4. Consider Making a Counteroffer:**\n\nI want to maximize my outcome while proposing a fair offer that Player 1 might accept. To ensure it is better than my outside offer, I want my value from this deal to exceed 55.\n\nCurrently, the total items are: \n- 6 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 6 units of item 3\n- 4 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nPlayer 1's offer reduces my gain considerably.

Receiving 86 is not sufficient compared to the certainty of receiving 140 by walking away.\n   - I should aim for a counteroffer that increases my value. I need to propose an offer that gives me a value closer to or greater than 140, considering the discount factor in potential future rounds.\n\n5. **Formulating a Counteroffer:**\n   - If I minimize what I give to Player 1 for high-value items I care about (items 2, 4, and 5), while being more flexible with items 1 and 3, I might secure a better deal.\n   - Offer Player 1 more of items 1 and 3, and keep more of items 2, 4, and 5 for myself.\n\n   Counteroffer calculation:\n   - Offer Player 1: [1, 1, 2, 0, 1].\n   - Keeping for myself: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n   - Value to me:\n     - Item 1: 4 * 7 = 28\n     - Item 2: 2 * 9 = 18\n     - Item 3: 3 * 6 = 18\n     - Item 4: 3 * 9 = 27\n     - Item 5: 3 * 8 = 24\n     - Total value = 28 + 18 + 18 + 27 + 24 = 115\n\n   - This value is still below 140, but potentially better for Player 1 than their initial offer, making them more likely to negotiate further.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will proceed with a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]}\n```",

Starting conservatively often helps.\n   - Tentatively, let's assume Player 2 values items differently, and I aim for a middle ground that allows some negotiations.\n\n   Since I have no prior offers on the table, I'll need to propose a distribution:\n\n   - Offer Player 2: \n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 0 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 1 units of item 5\n\nIn theoretical terms, this gives Player 2 less than half of each item, potentially maximizing my share but leaving room for Player 2 to want a bit more.

However, given that round 3 is the final round, any proposal now would need to leave me better off than the current offer after potential further negotiations in the next round. To give myself a better outcome, I would prefer receiving more of the higher-valued items, especially Item 1 and Item 2. \n\n### Construct a Counteroffer\n\nI will propose a small but favorable counteroffer to improve my position. A possible offer could be:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n\nThis way I can retain more of the higher-valued items like Item 1 and Item 2 for myself. Let's evaluate the value I'd get from this counteroffer:\n\n- I keep 5 units of Item 1: 9 x 5 = 45\n- I keep 3 units of Item 2: 9 x 3 = 27\n- I keep 3 units of Item 3: 7 x 3 = 21\n- I keep 4 units of Item 4: 8 x 4 = 32\n- I keep 2 units of Item 5: 4 x 2 = 8\n\nTotal value if I retain these:  \n45 + 27 + 21 + 32 + 8 = 133\n\nCounteroffer reduces Player 2's units in Item 5 more notably to adjust balance slightly in my favor while still being reasonable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince this counteroffer gives me higher value combined with my favorable distribution of items while still being able to satisfy Player 2 with their preferences potentially, I proceed with this:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]}\n```",

The goal is to maximize my value from the negotiation.\n\n**Current Offer Evaluation:**\n- Item 1: I receive 1 unit, which is worth 2 points per unit. Total = 2\n- Item 2: I receive 0 units, worth 2 points per unit. Total = 0\n- Item 3: I receive 0 units, worth 8 points per unit. Total = 0\n- Item 4: I receive 5 units, worth 9 points per unit. Total = 45\n- Item 5: I receive 2 units, worth 2 points per unit. Total = 4\n\nThe total value of the current offer = 2 + 0 + 0 + 45 + 4 = 51\n\n**Consideration of Outside Offer:**\n- My outside offer is worth 58. This is the minimum value I should accept, as any negotiation deal should be better than this value.\n\n**Discount Factor:**\n- The current offer results in a value of 51 without considering the discount for the round. In Round 1, the discount factor doesn't apply, so 51 remains 51.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe current offer's value (51) is lower than my outside offer (58). I will counteroffer to try to reach a deal better than my outside offer. A potential strategy is to seek more value from items 3 and 4, which are highly valuable to me.\n\n**Strategy for Counteroffer:**\n1. I have high value from items 3 (8 points each) and 4 (9 points each).\n2. I'll offer less of item 4 and maximize item 3 for myself.\n\n**Counteroffer:**\n- Item 1: 1 unit (same as the current offer to Player 1)\n- Item 2: 0 units (same as the current offer to Player 1)\n- Item 3: 0 units (retain both units for maximizing my value)\n- Item 4: 3 units (I need 3 units which gives me 27 points, Player 1 gets the remaining for trade)\n- Item 5: 2 units (same as the current offer to Player 1)\n\nMy proposal is to give Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 3, 2].\n\nThis counteroffer leaves me with 2 units of item 3 and 3 units of item 4, which maximizes my points.\n\nThe resulting calculation for my share: \n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 2 * 8 = 16\n- Item 4: 3 * 9 = 27\n- Item 5: 2 * 2 = 4\n\nTotal = 2 + 16 + 27 + 4 = 49\n\nSince there might not be a better proposal without accounting for a lower round discount, I might need another move post my offer, hence allowing a potential deal before round 3.\n\nMy counteroffer strategy will allow for better negotiation in subsequent rounds, possibly being accepted by the other party.\n\nThus, the action is:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 3, 2]}",

However, given that 66 is the total if I get everything, I must carefully consider the distribution to still exceed the outside option value.\n\n4. **Initial Offer Strategy:**\n   - I aim to propose a division where I still receive a high value, but which could be acceptable to Player 2.\n   - Given the lack of information about Player 2's valuations, I will offer a division leaning towards keeping more valuable items with me while still presenting a reasonable share to Player 2.\n   - I\u2019ll craft an offer assuming Player 2 has a moderate equal valuation across items, which means not giving them too many of any item that has a higher personal value to me.\n\n5. **Make a Reasonable Counteroffer:**\n\nLet's propose an offer where Player 2 gets:\n- Item 1: 2 units (Value to me: 4)\n- Item 2: 1 unit (Value to me: 3)\n- Item 3: 0 units (Value to me: 0)\n- Item 4: 2 units (Value to me: 8)\n- Item 5: 2 units (Value to me: 2)\n\nAfter this offer, my value from receiving the rest would be:\n- Item 1: 4 units * 2 = 8\n- Item 2: 2 units * 3 = 6\n- Item 3: 2 units * 5 = 10\n- Item 4: 6 units * 4 = 24\n- Item 5: 1 unit * 1 = 1\n- Total Value = 8 + 6 + 10 + 24 + 1 = 49\n\nConsidering the gamma discounting, this is a reduction from the initial potential of 66, but far above my walk-away value of 9. Thus, this offer will still provide me with a considerable value should it be accepted.\n\nTherefore, my action is to propose a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 2, 2]}\n```",

Therefore, the current offer is less than my outside option.\n\nBefore walking away, I should consider a counteroffer since it's the first round, and I have room to negotiate for a better deal. My goal is to ensure the total value I receive is greater than 117 or close to it after taking into account the discount factor (which doesn't apply to first-round outcomes but is a consideration for later rounds).\n\nTo formulate a counteroffer that could appeal to Player 1, I should leave them with fewer high-value items to me and more of those that might be less valuable to me. My items and private values differ, so I aim to retain more of items 2 and 3, which are the most valuable to me.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that lets me keep most of the high-value items for myself and could still be considered acceptable by Player 1. \n\nCounteroffer to Player 1:\n- Item 1: Offer 2 to Player 1, keep 4\n- Item 2: Offer 2 to Player 1, keep 4\n- Item 3: Offer 2 to Player 1, keep 3\n- Item 4: Offer 3 to Player 1, keep 3\n- Item 5: Offer 3 to Player 1, keep 3\n\nCalculating my value if they accept:\n\n- Value of Item 1: 4 units * 7 = 28\n- Value of Item 2: 4 units * 10 = 40\n- Value of Item 3: 3 units * 8 = 24\n- Value of Item 4: 3 units * 2 = 6\n- Value of Item 5: 3 units * 3 = 9\n\nTotal value from this offer = 28 + 40 + 24 + 6 + 9 = 107\n\nUnfortunately, this counteroffer does not meet my outside offer of 117.

Therefore, the current discounted value of the offer (24.3) is greater than my outside offer.\n\n### Potential Action\nAlthough the current offer is better than my outside offer, it\u2019s likely that I can negotiate to get a better deal because I still have one more round. Offering Player 2 fewer desired items that have a lower value to me might increase my mediated outcome.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy\nBased on Player 2\u2019s initial offer, it's clear they might value item 4 significantly, as they asked for it in both rounds. Let's propose offering them more of item 4, which I value less compared to other items.\n\nMy counteroffer has to balance my strategy to keep high-value items and give away items that are less valuable to me, while still making it tempting for Player 2 by addressing their apparent preference for item 4. I'm aiming to maximize my retained value while keeping this attractive to Player 2.\n\n### Constructing the Counteroffer\nHere's a possible counteroffer balancing both my interest and attempting to nudge Player 2:\n- Offer Player 2: [0, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n  - I keep all item 1 (high value to me)\n  - I keep most of item 3 (high value to me)\n  - I lower the amount for item 4, staying close to their initial counteroffer.\n  \n### Conclusion\nThe aim is to increase my high-value items based on my understanding, possibly resulting in Player 2 agreeing due to unchanged item 4 allowances and improved item 3.

                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's first evaluate the current offer Player 1 has made and compare it to our outside offer:\n\n1. **Evaluate Current Offer [0, 0, 1, 2, 0] from Player 1**:\n   - Item 1: 0 units * 10 value = 0\n   - Item 2: 0 units * 4 value = 0\n   - Item 3: 1 unit * 5 value = 5\n   - Item 4: 2 units * 4 value = 8\n   - Item 5: 0 units * 10 value = 0\n   - Total Value = 0 + 0 + 5 + 8 + 0 = 13\n\n   Adjusting for the discount rate (gamma = 0.9 for round 2), the discounted value = 13 * 0.9 = 11.7\n\n2. **Compare with Outside Offer**:\n   - My outside offer is 44. In the event we walk away, I get 44.\n\nCurrent offer value with discount of 11.7 is significantly lower than my outside offer of 44. Thus, accepting the current offer does not make sense as it provides much less value than simply walking away.\n\n3. **Make a Counteroffer:**\n\nTo ensure maximizing value while providing a reasonable offer considering Player 1's possible preferences seen in their previous offers, we should attempt a counteroffer that gives me higher potential value. Let's construct a counteroffer:\n\n- Give Player 1 fewer valuable items to me\n- Since Player 1 seems to be interested in Item 4 (based on their offers), I will give more of it but keep higher value items like Item 1 and Item 5.\n\nHere\u2019s a balanced counteroffer:\n- Offer: [0, 0, 2, 3, 0]\n\nRationale:\n- Item 1: Keep all, high value\n- Item 3: They have shown an interest, can give 2 \n- Item 4: High interest shown, give 3 units\n- Item 5: Keep, high value\n\nTotal Value to me if they accept:\n- Item 1: 3 units * 10 value = 30\n- Item 3: 3 units * 5 value = 15\n- Item 4: 1 unit * 4 value = 4\n- Item 5: 1 unit * 10 value = 10\n- Total Value = 30 + 0 + 15 + 4 + 10 = 59\n\nWith this counteroffer, I gain a potential 59 (discounting here isn't needed as this would be accepted in subsequent responses) which is over my outside offer, giving more incentive for a beneficial deal.\n\nGiven these calculations and strategy for maximizing my value while negotiating reasonably, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 3, 0]}\n```",

Since this is round 1, the discount factor does not apply yet.\n\n- Value from accepting the current offer = 15\n- Value from my outside offer = 33\n\nClearly, the value from my outside offer (33) is significantly higher than the value of the current offer (15).\n\n### Decision\nGiven that my outside offer provides substantially more value than the current offer, I should either propose a counteroffer that would give me more value or walk away. However, since the current offer is quite low compared to my outside offer, I'll attempt to secure a better deal before considering a walk in the next rounds.\n\n### Counteroffer Proposal\nTo surpass the value of my outside offer, I need to achieve a value greater than or equal to 33. \n\nLet's propose a counteroffer:\n- I'll attempt to keep 2 units of item 4, which alone offers a value of 16 (2 * 8), and the remaining portion should contain high-value items like item 3. \n- Counteroffer: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0], which means I offer Player 1 the minimum for items 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThis offer ensures I keep the entirety of:\n- 2 units of item 1 (value = 4)\n- 2 units of item 2 (value = 6)\n- 3 units of item 3 (value = 12)\n- 2 units of item 4 (value = 16)\n- 2 units of item 5 (value = 8)\n\nTotal value with this counteroffer = 4 + 6 + 12 + 16 + 8 = 46\nWith the discount rate for later rounds, aiming for 46 unadjusted allows me to optimize further interactions.\n\n**My counteroffer maximizes the opportunity to surpass my outside offer.**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

Since Item 3 has the highest value per unit, we should aim to retain most or all of these units.\n2. We can offer more units of items with lower value to us, like Item 5, to Player 2.\n3. We should balance the rest of the items strategically to achieve a high value for us.\n\nLet's create an initial offer:\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 1 (we keep 2 units).\n- Offer 2 units of Item 2 (we keep 1 unit).\n- Offer 0 units of Item 3 (we keep all units).\n- Offer 2 units of Item 4 (we keep 2 units).\n- Offer all 4 units of Item 5 (we keep 0 units).\n\nCalculating the expected value for us from this division:\n- Item 1: 2 units * 6 = 12\n- Item 2: 1 unit * 3 = 3\n- Item 3: 4 units * 9 = 36\n- Item 4: 2 units * 5 = 10\n- Item 5: 0 units * 2 = 0\n\nTotal = 12 + 3 + 36 + 10 + 0 = 61\n\nThe current offer would result in a value of 61 for us, which exceeds our outside offer of 59. Thus, this division is advantageous if agreed upon. \n\nTherefore, I should extend this as my initial counteroffer to balance offering something acceptable to Player 2, while maximizing my own outcome:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 2, 4]}",

The discount rate is 0.9, so the adjusted value is:\n\nAdjusted value = 54 * 0.9 = 48.6\n\n### Outside Option\n\nMy outside offer is 59, which exceeds the adjusted value of the current offer (48.6). Therefore, accepting this offer is not favorable compared to my outside option.\n\n### Considering a Counteroffer\n\nTo make a counteroffer, I need to achieve a value of at least 59 in adjusted terms due to the discounting in round 2. Here\u2019s a calculation for potential counteroffers:\n\n- My value for items needed to reach at least 59 after 10% discount, i.e., 59 since 59/0.9 \u2248 65.56 in round 2 decision:\n  - Adjust counts so total at our hand value is approximately 65.56 rounded up. Prioritize high value items (Item 3, Item 1, etc.)\n- Aim offer: At least get back some high value items and maintain or increase any other possible segment.\n- Consider distribution and balance amongst units in a response that achieves the goal.\n\nHere's a counter-offer where trying to maximize my value:\n- Leave some (but less) units on low-value items to give more units back to opposing player.\n- Offer balance: [1, 2, 0, 0, 2] (offers what gives me enough on critical parts with less decrease from given offer.)\n\n### Valuation:\n- **Item 1**: 2 units retained (total 3 - 1 from counter) = 2 * 6 = 12\n- **Item 2**: 1 units retained (total 3 - 2 from counter) = 1 * 3 = 3\n- **Item 3**: 4 units retained (none offered) = 4 * 9 = 36\n- **Item 4**: fully retained (non-offered more) = 4 * 5 = 20\n- **Item 5**: 2 units retained (total 4 - 2 from counter) = 2 * 2 = 4\n\nTotal = 12 + 3 + 36 + 20 + 4 = 75, Adjusted value in round 2 = 75 * 0.9 = 67.5 which is better than my outside offer.\n\nThus it\u2019s preferable and practically justifiable. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "To decide on the optimal action, let's go through the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. **Current Situation**:\n   - No offer has been made yet, so it's the initial round where I can make the first move.\n   - The items to be divided are:\n     - 5 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n\n2. **Value Assessment**:\n   - My values per unit are:\n     - Item 1: 7\n     - Item 2: 4\n     - Item 3: 10\n     - Item 4: 1\n     - Item 5: 1\n   - The total value if I get all items is:\n     - 5 * 7 + 5 * 4 + 1 * 10 + 5 * 1 + 4 * 1 = 35 + 20 + 10 + 5 + 4 = 74\n\n3. **Outside Offer**:\n   - My outside offer is 73, which is significantly close to the maximum value I can get from the items.\n\n4. **Considerations**:\n   - To maximize my outcome, I need a negotiation deal that gives me a value greater than 73 since 0.9^0 = 1 in the first round.\n   - As this is the first round, our aim should be to propose an offer that maximizes the value gathered from the items while ensuring that the potential acceptance by Player 2 is feasible.\n\n5. **Strategy for the Counteroffer**:\n   - Since item 3 gives the highest value per unit (10), I should aim to keep it.\n   - I should aim to keep a majority of item 1 due to its high value (7) and some units of item 2. \n   - Item 4 and item 5 have low values (1), so offering more of these to Player 2 could potentially make my offer more attractive to them without significantly decreasing my outcome.\n\n6. **Formulate a Counteroffer**:\n   - Proposal to give:\n     - Item 1: 1 unit to Player 2\n     - Item 2: 2 units to Player 2\n     - Item 3: 0 units to Player 2 (I keep full)\n     - Item 4: 4 units to Player 2\n     - Item 5: 3 units to Player 2\n\nThis proposed allocation ensures I get sufficient value from the items I keep, with the focus on maximizing my outcome.\n\n7. **Value Calculation**:\n   - For me with the current offer:\n     - Item 1: 4 units (4 * 7 = 28)\n     - Item 2: 3 units (3 * 4 = 12)\n     - Item 3: 1 unit (1 * 10 = 10)\n     - Item 4: 1 unit (1 * 1 = 1)\n     - Item 5: 1 unit (1 * 1 = 1)\n     - Total value = 28 + 12 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 52\n     - Since this would not exceed my outside offer when discounted (52 < 73), I should reconsider to provide a fair counteroffer or walk.\n\nGiven this calculation mistake, I should revise my offer to maximize value or consider walking. However, I aimed for a strategy to play further.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with the following adjusted **counteroffer**:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 4, 3]}\n```",

However, there might be room for improvement through a counteroffer since the negotiation is not yet in the last round.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy\nTo enhance my outcome while keeping it appealing for Player 1, I'll propose a slightly different distribution where I gain more units of items with high personal value, particularly item 1 and item 5.\n\nOffer [3, 1, 1, 2, 2] allows me:\n\n- I give Player 1:\n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n  \n- I get:\n  - 5 units of item 1 (8 - 3)\n  - 2 units of item 2 (3 - 1)\n  - 4 units of item 3 (5 - 1)\n  - 2 units of item 4 (4 - 2)\n  - 2 units of item 5 (4 - 2)\n\nEvaluating this proposed distribution:\n\n- Value for 5 of item 1: \\(5 \\times 9 = 45\\)\n- Value for 2 of item 2: \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\)\n- Value for 4 of item 3: \\(4 \\times 1 = 4\\)\n- Value for 2 of item 4: \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\)\n- Value for 2 of item 5: \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\)\n\nTotal value with my counteroffer: \\(45 + 8 + 4 + 14 + 18 = 89\\)\n\nEffective value with discount: \\( 89 \\times 0.9 = 80.1\\)\n\nIt's worth trying this counteroffer as it provides room for negotiation in the final round, looking to maximize my outcome while making our positions a little closer.\n\nTherefore, my action is to propose a counteroffer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

My private valuation is a key driver in deciding which items to offer:\n\n- **Item 1:** Given my high valuation (7), I prefer keeping more of these units. Offer 1 unit.\n- **Item 2:** This is low value for me (2), hence offer all 2 units.\n- **Item 3:** Moderate value (3), I'll offer 2 units.\n- **Item 4:** No units available, so nothing to offer.\n- **Item 5:** High value (9) for me, prefer keeping all.\n\n**Offer to Player 2: [1 unit of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 0 unit of Item 4, 0 unit of Item 5]**\n\n#### My Counteroffer\nI propose to give Player 2:\n- 1 unit of Item 1\n- 2 units of Item 2\n- 2 units of Item 3\n- 0 unit of Item 4\n- 0 unit of Item 5\n\nThe proposal enables me to keep the majority of high-value items for myself while providing them a balanced share. This strategy should maximize my value over my outside offer considering the given discount factor if it proceeds to further rounds.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

If Player 2 takes 2, I get 2, which provides me 2 * 10 = 20.\n- My value for item 2 is 8. If Player 2 takes 1, I get 1, which provides me 1 * 8 = 8.\n- My value for item 3 is 1. If Player 2 takes 0, I get 1, which provides me 1 * 1 = 1.\n- My value for item 4 is 1. If Player 2 takes 1, I get 1, which provides me 1 * 1 = 1.\n- My value for item 5 is 6. If Player 2 takes 1, I get 1, which provides me 1 * 6 = 6.\n\nTotal value of the current offer to me: 20 + 8 + 1 + 1 + 6 = 36.\n\n**Considering the Discount Factor:**\n\nSince it's Round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. The adjusted value of the current offer is 36 * 0.9 = 32.4.\n\n**Outside Offer Value:**\n\nMy outside offer is 2.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n- The adjusted value of accepting the current offer is 32.4, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 2. Therefore, accepting the current offer is definitely preferable to walking away.\n\n**Evaluating a Counteroffer:**\n\nTo determine if I should counter, I need to consider if I can achieve a better offer:\n- Maintaining as much of item 1 as possible is critical since it's my highest valued item.\n- Items 2 and 5 carry substantial value as well.\n\nA promising counteroffer could involve me retaining more of item 1 while still giving Player 2 something valuable.\n\n**Potential Counteroffer Evaluation:**\n1. Retain 3 of item 1 (leaving 1 for Player 2).\n2. Retain both item 2s (offering 0 of item 2 to Player 2).\n3. I can offer item 3 since it has low value.\n4. Offer 1 of item 4 keeping a fair distribution.\n5. Retain 1 of item 5 as it carries good value and offer 1.\n\nThis would look like giving Player 2 [1, 0, 1, 1, 1].\n\nLet's calculate the value under this counteroffer:\n\n- I get 3 of item 1: 3 * 10 = 30.\n- I get 2 of item 2: 2 * 8 = 16.\n- I get 0 of item 3: 0 * 1 = 0.\n- I get 1 of item 4: 1 * 1 = 1.\n- I get 1 of item 5: 1 * 6 = 6.\n\nTotal value: 30 + 16 + 0 + 1 + 6 = 53.\n\nAdjusting for the discount: 53 * 0.9 = 47.7.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nA counteroffer that benefits me much more significantly could be tested to see if Player 2 is willing to give up more items, especially item 1 and 2, that are highly valuable to me.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]}",

Thus, based on this calculation, accepting the current offer is better in terms of total value than opting for the outside offer.\n\n4. **Consideration of Making a Counteroffer**:\n    - My goal should be to get more value if possible. However, any counteroffer needs to not risk the deal because it must also be acceptable to Player 1.\n    - From the negotiation history, it seems Player 1 values item 3 (since they've consistently included it in offers and proposed a counter where they get it), and potentially item 4, given they offered both in the first round.\n    - Given it's Round 2, Player 1 might be looking to secure the deal. However, pushing them too hard might risk walking away.\n\nThe optimal play is to get at least the current value, which is significantly higher than my outside offer, without risking a breakdown in negotiations which might yield less than this by either delaying to round 3 or causing Player 1 to walk away.\n\nWith these considerations, accepting the offer is likely a prudent choice to ensure a high value relative to the alternative (the outside offer).\n\n5. **Decision**:\n   - The current offer provides a substantial value, and there is a risk associated with making a counteroffer that is not accepted, resulting in a potential lower value walk outcome.\n   - Therefore, it is strategic to secure this beneficial outcome.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Thus, any counteroffer should aim for a present value greater than or equal to my discounted fallback value (72 * 0.9 = 64.8 in this round), which is already below the original calculated value (69).\n\nSince the current offer value (69) is less than my outside offer (72), there is no advantage in accepting the current offer. However, if Player 1's offer could potentially improve in the next round, I should propose a counteroffer that increases my value above my outside offer of 72 and potentially aims at maintaining flexibility across the negotiation rounds.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy:\n\nI will attempt to maximize my value by reducing Player 1's share of the most valuable items for me:\n\nPropose the counteroffer [3, 1, 1, 0, 0] to Player 1:\n- I would take [4, 1, 2, 4, 1], which gives me:\n  - 4 * 6 (item 1) = 24\n  - 1 * 8 (item 2) = 8\n  - 2 * 7 (item 3) = 14\n  - 4 * 5 (item 4) = 20\n  - 1 * 2 (item 5) = 2\n- My total value for this counteroffer = 24 + 8 + 14 + 20 + 2 = 68\n\nThis attempt aims to set up for a better round position as the negotiation continues, and I might protract further if Player 1 responds positively in the next round.\n\n### Decision:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 0, 0]}",

So the present value of this offer to me is 25.\n\n**Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n\n- My outside offer is valued at 19. \n\nThe current offer value (25) is higher than my outside offer (19), so it is already a better option compared to walking away.\n\n**Deciding on Action:**\n\nSince the current offer already provides more value than my outside offer and offers a fair value considering the total is 69, it seems acceptable. Additionally, accepting now avoids the risk of Player 1 walking away in subsequent rounds, which could leave me with the outside offer value.\n\nTherefore, given the above analysis, my best action in this scenario is to:\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

However, the current offer value (82) is significantly lower than my outside offer (109).\n\n**Decision:**\nWith my outside offer being significantly higher than the value I would get from accepting the current offer, I should not accept it. Instead, I will make a counteroffer to maximize my potential gain while still being reasonable enough that Player 1 might accept it.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal:**\nTo increase my value, I'll aim to shift more valuable items toward me. My focus is on increasing the quantity of items 2 and 3, which have the highest values to me.\n\nLet's counteroffer by adjusting the allocation:\n\nProposed counteroffer:\n- Offer 1 unit of item 1 to Player 1\n- Offer 3 units of item 2 to Player 1\n- Offer 2 units of item 3 to Player 1\n- Offer 1 unit of item 4 to Player 1\n- Offer 2 units of item 5 to Player 1\n\nThis would mean I get [3, 4, 5, 2, 2].

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To decide my action, I must evaluate the current offer from Player 1 and compare it to my outside offer value of 45. I also need to consider the discounted value of the negotiation as it proceeds through rounds.\n\n### Current Offer Evaluation\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 is proposing that I receive:\n\n- 6 units of item 1 (8 total, they offer 2)\n- 2 units of item 2 (0 offered, so I get all)\n- 2 units of item 3 (3 total, they offer 1)\n- 4 units of item 4 (5 total, they offer 1)\n- 3 units of item 5 (5 total, they offer 2)\n\nNext, let's calculate the value of these items to me using my private valuations:\n\n- Item 1: 6 units * 2 value per unit = 12\n- Item 2: 2 units * 7 value per unit = 14\n- Item 3: 2 units * 5 value per unit = 10\n- Item 4: 4 units * 9 value per unit = 36\n- Item 5: 3 units * 8 value per unit = 24\n\nTotal value of current offer = 12 + 14 + 10 + 36 + 24 = 96\n\n### Compare to Outside Offer\n\nMy outside offer value is 45. The current offer's value of 96 is much higher than my outside offer, and at this stage, the gamma discount is not applied because I would be accepting immediately.\n\n### Decision\n\nIn this first round, the current offer, without any discount applied, is significantly higher than my outside offer. Accepting this offer would maximize the value I obtain compared to walking away with the outside offer value of 45.\n\nTherefore, given the high value of the current offer compared to my outside option, I should:\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",
