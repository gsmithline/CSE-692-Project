Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1105. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1105. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 816 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 8, 0, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 0 + 79 x 4 + 46 x 8 + 33 x 0 + 69 x 6\n    which is 1098 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1105. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1105\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 45\n    *   Item 2: 79\n    *   Item 3: 46\n    *   Item 4: 33\n    *   Item 5: 69\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 8 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  This means that if the negotiation extends to round 2, the value will be multiplied by 0.9, and by 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 if it reaches round 3. It incentivizes reaching a deal sooner rather than later.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since there is no current offer, I need to make an initial offer.  I need to determine how many of each item to offer to Player 2. My goal is to offer enough to encourage Player 2 to accept and get a higher value than my outside offer.\n    Let me start by calculating the value of keeping everything:\n    *   3 * 45 + 4 * 79 + 8 * 46 + 2 * 33 + 6 * 69 = 135 + 316 + 368 + 66 + 414 = 1299.\n\n    Let's try offering half of the items. If the total is an odd number we will round the offer down for each type of item.\n    Offering Player 2:\n    * Item 1: 1 unit\n    * Item 2: 2 unit\n    * Item 3: 4 unit\n    * Item 4: 1 unit\n    * Item 5: 3 unit\n\n    That leaves me with:\n    * Item 1: 2 unit, value = 2 * 45 = 90\n    * Item 2: 2 unit, value = 2 * 79 = 158\n    * Item 3: 4 unit, value = 4 * 46 = 184\n    * Item 4: 1 unit, value = 1 * 33 = 33\n    * Item 5: 3 unit, value = 3 * 69 = 207\n    Total value = 90 + 158 + 184 + 33 + 207 = 672\n\n    This is not good enough, my outside offer is 1105.\n    Let me try offering less to the other player.\n\n    Offering Player 2:\n    * Item 1: 0 unit\n    * Item 2: 1 unit\n    * Item 3: 3 unit\n    * Item 4: 0 unit\n    * Item 5: 2 unit\n\n    That leaves me with:\n    * Item 1: 3 unit, value = 3 * 45 = 135\n    * Item 2: 3 unit, value = 3 * 79 = 237\n    * Item 3: 5 unit, value = 5 * 46 = 230\n    * Item 4: 2 unit, value = 2 * 33 = 66\n    * Item 5: 4 unit, value = 4 * 69 = 276\n    Total value = 135 + 237 + 230 + 66 + 276 = 944\n\n    Still not good enough. Let's offer a bit less to the other player and see what happens.\n\n    Offering Player 2:\n    * Item 1: 0 unit\n    * Item 2: 0 unit\n    * Item 3: 2 unit\n    * Item 4: 0 unit\n    * Item 5: 1 unit\n\n    That leaves me with:\n    * Item 1: 3 unit, value = 3 * 45 = 135\n    * Item 2: 4 unit, value = 4 * 79 = 316\n    * Item 3: 6 unit, value = 6 * 46 = 276\n    * Item 4: 2 unit, value = 2 * 33 = 66\n    * Item 5: 5 unit, value = 5 * 69 = 345\n    Total value = 135 + 316 + 276 + 66 + 345 = 1138\n\n    This is better than my outside offer. This offer also avoids offering nothing or all items.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince I have a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, I will propose this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 290\n*   **My item values:** 28 (item 1), 22 (item 2), 33 (item 3), 32 (item 4), 25 (item 5)\n*   **Total pool of items:** 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that the value of a deal in later rounds is discounted. In this round (round 1), the value of the deal will not be discounted.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 8 - 2 = 6 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n    \n    The value of this to me would be:\n    (3 * 28) + (4 * 22) + (6 * 33) + (2 * 32) + (5 * 25) = 84 + 88 + 198 + 64 + 125 = 559\n    \n    Since 559 > 290, the current offer is better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer where I propose to give player 1 half of the items (approximately) and keep the rest. For instance offering [1,2,4,1,3]. This is only one example, and I should probably generate a few different potential counteroffers.\n        * Keeping [2, 2, 4, 1, 3]: (2 * 28) + (2 * 22) + (4 * 33) + (1 * 32) + (3 * 25) = 56 + 44 + 132 + 32 + 75 = 339\n        * Keeping [1, 2, 4, 1, 3]: (1 * 28) + (2 * 22) + (4 * 33) + (1 * 32) + (3 * 25) = 28 + 44 + 132 + 32 + 75 = 311\n        * Keeping [2, 1, 3, 1, 2]: (2 * 28) + (1 * 22) + (3 * 33) + (1 * 32) + (2 * 25) = 56 + 22 + 99 + 32 + 50 = 259\n        * Keeping [1, 1, 3, 0, 1]: (1 * 28) + (1 * 22) + (3 * 33) + (0 * 32) + (1 * 25) = 28 + 22 + 99 + 0 + 25 = 174\n        * Keeping [2,3,4,1,4] : (2 * 28) + (3* 22) + (4*33) + (1*32) + (4*25) = 56 + 66 + 132 + 32 + 100 = 386\n\n    A counteroffer must be better than my outside offer. So, keeping [2,3,4,1,4] gives me a value of 386, is a viable option as a counter offer.  It also seems like [1,2,4,1,3] may not be that great as an offer, but keeping [2, 2, 4, 1, 3] has value 339, which is also quite good. My counter offer should be giving items to the opponent, so I want to consider the opposite of the keeping sets.\n    Offering [1, 1, 4, 1, 2] gets me 339. Offering [2, 1, 4, 1, 3] gets me 311. Offering [1, 3, 4, 1, 2] gets me 386.\n\n    Compared to my outside offer, the current offer is far better than the 290 I could get. Therefore, I do not want to walk away.\n    \n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is very good (559), and is well above my outside offer of 290. However, we are only in round one, and I think I could potentially improve this deal further.\n\nI will propose a counter offer [1, 1, 4, 1, 2]. This is where I give 1 item 1, 1 item 2, 4 item 3, 1 item 4, 2 item 5 to the other player.  This will mean I am keeping [2, 3, 4, 1, 4] , which gives me a value of 386, which is still greater than my outside offer of 290.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 4, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 8, 0, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 0 + 79 x 4 + 46 x 8 + 33 x 0 + 69 x 6\n    which is 1098 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1105. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 4, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 4, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1105\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 45, Item 2: 79, Item 3: 46, Item 4: 33, Item 5: 69\n*   **Total items:** 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 4, 1, 2]. This means I get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 45 = 45\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 79 = 79\n    *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 46 = 184\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 33 = 33\n    *   2 unit of item 5: 2 * 69 = 138\n    *   Total value of current offer: 45 + 79 + 184 + 33 + 138 = 479\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 479 * 0.9 = 431.1\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what would be a good offer that is greater than my outside option after the discount factor. Let's start by keeping the items I value most:\n    *   Let's propose offering the following to Player 2: [0,0,4,0,0]. That means I keep [3,4,4,2,6]. Value = 3 * 45 + 4 * 79 + 4 * 46 + 2 * 33 + 6 * 69 = 135 + 316 + 184 + 66 + 414 = 1115. This offer after discount = 1115 * 0.9 = 1003.5. This isn't good enough compared to my outside offer of 1105.\n    * Let's try giving 1 more unit of item 3 to the other player. Offer [0, 0, 5, 0, 0]. I keep [3, 4, 3, 2, 6]. Value = 3 * 45 + 4 * 79 + 3 * 46 + 2 * 33 + 6 * 69 = 135 + 316 + 138 + 66 + 414 = 1069. Discounted Value = 1069 * 0.9 = 962.1. This is still worse than the outside offer.\n    * Let's try giving 2 more units of item 3 to the other player, which will be 6 items total. Offer [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]. I keep [3, 4, 2, 2, 6]. Value = 3 * 45 + 4 * 79 + 2 * 46 + 2 * 33 + 6 * 69 = 135 + 316 + 92 + 66 + 414 = 1023. Discounted value = 1023 * 0.9 = 920.7. Still worse.\n    * Let's try giving 2 units of item 2 as well as 6 units of item 3. Offer [0, 2, 6, 0, 0]. I keep [3, 2, 2, 2, 6]. Value = 3 * 45 + 2 * 79 + 2 * 46 + 2 * 33 + 6 * 69 = 135 + 158 + 92 + 66 + 414 = 865. Discounted Value = 865 * 0.9 = 778.5. This is getting worse.\n    *Let's try keeping most of the items, giving the other player a small number of items. Let's try offer [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]. That means I keep [3, 3, 6, 2, 5]. Value = 3 * 45 + 3 * 79 + 6 * 46 + 2 * 33 + 5 * 69 = 135 + 237 + 276 + 66 + 345 = 1059. Discounted Value = 1059 * 0.9 = 953.1. Still worse than outside offer.\n    * Let's keep all of my higher valued items. Offer: [0,0,0,2,6]. This means I keep [3,4,8,0,0]. Value = 3 * 45 + 4 * 79 + 8 * 46 = 135 + 316 + 368 = 819. Discounted value = 819 * 0.9 = 737.1\n   * Let's try an offer that prioritizes my high value items.  Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. I keep [3, 4, 8, 2, 6]. Value =  3 * 45 + 4 * 79 + 8 * 46 + 2 * 33 + 6 * 69 = 135 + 316 + 368 + 66 + 414 = 1299. Discounted Value = 1299 * 0.9 = 1169.1. This offer is good.\n   \n    \n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 431.1 which is worse than my outside offer of 1105. I have found a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (keeping all items for myself) has a discounted value of 1169.1. Therefore I should propose that offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step and decide on my best action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 332. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 73\n    *   Item 2: 27\n    *   Item 3: 76\n    *   Item 4: 48\n    *   Item 5: 33\n*   **Total items:**\n    *   Item 1: 1\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 1\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that any deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1, and any deal in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its value in round 1. This slightly disincentivizes delaying a deal, since I must weight any future deal by the discount factor.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I am Player 1 and it is the first round, I have to make the first offer. I need to consider potential counteroffers that would be better than my outside offer while being attractive enough for Player 2 to consider.\n\n   Let's test a few example offers:\n\n   *   **Offer 1: Giving away half the items (approximately, where possible).** Offering Player 2: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2]. This means I would keep [1, 2, 1, 3, 2] of each item.\n        * My Value = (1*73) + (2*27) + (1*76) + (3*48) + (2*33) = 73 + 54 + 76 + 144 + 66 = 413. This offer is greater than 332.\n        \n   *   **Offer 2: Giving away most of the items, except for my most valued item.** Offering Player 2: [0, 4, 0, 5, 4]. I would keep [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. \n        * My Value = (1*73) + (0*27) + (1*76) + (0*48) + (0*33) = 73 + 0 + 76 + 0 + 0 = 149. This offer is less than 332 and is thus a mistake.\n\n   *   **Offer 3: Giving away little, keeping most.**  Offering Player 2: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]. This means I keep [1, 3, 1, 4, 3].\n        * My Value = (1*73) + (3*27) + (1*76) + (4*48) + (3*33) = 73 + 81 + 76 + 192 + 99 = 521. This offer is greater than 332.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will choose to propose the first offer. Offering half seems too generous, and keeping everything isn't viable. \n* I'll offer Player 2 [0, 2, 0, 2, 2] which gives me a value of 413. I will not make the offer where I keep only my most valued items, as that is less than my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 112. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 903 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 1 + 44 x 0 + 100 x 1 + 64 x 0 + 82 x 0\n    which is 111 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 112. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I need to make sure that the amount of items I keep for myself is worth more than 494. I will make sure that my offer does not result in me making less than my outside offer.\n\n    Let me consider several possible offers for Player 2:\n\n    *   **Offer 1: Offer nothing (give player 2 zero of each item).** This means I keep all the items.  My value would be: (2 * 15) + (6 * 24) + (1 * 20) + (5 * 78) + (2 * 36) = 30 + 144 + 20 + 390 + 72 = 656.

I keep [2, 4, 1, 4, 2].** My value would be (2 * 15) + (4 * 24) + (1 * 20) + (4 * 78) + (2 * 36) = 30 + 96 + 20 + 312 + 72 = 530.

My value would be: (2 * 15) + (5 * 24) + (1 * 20) + (4 * 78) + (2 * 36) = 30 + 120 + 20 + 312 + 72 = 554.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 59. This is my guaranteed minimum.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 99\n    *   Item 2: 87\n    *   Item 3: 83\n    *   Item 4: 23\n    *   Item 5: 19\n*   **Total Items:** There are 2 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of a deal in round 1. A deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value of a deal in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I would get:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 99 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 87 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 83 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 23 = 23\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 19 = 0\n    Total value of current offer to me: 23. This is less than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**  I need to consider a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer value. Let's calculate the value of keeping all items. This is my total value.\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 99 = 198\n    *   6 units of item 2: 6 * 87 = 522\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 83 = 83\n    *   5 units of item 4: 5 * 23 = 115\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 19 = 38\n    Total Value: 198 + 522 + 83 + 115 + 38 = 956\n\n    I will create a counteroffer that takes most of the value. Let's start by offering 1 item of each type to player 1:\n    *   Keeping 1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 99 = 99\n    *   Keeping 5 units of item 2 = 5 * 87 = 435\n    *   Keeping 0 unit of item 3 = 0 * 83 = 0\n    *   Keeping 4 units of item 4 = 4 * 23 = 92\n    *   Keeping 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 19 = 19\n    Total value = 99 + 435 + 0 + 92 + 19 = 645\n    This is greater than my outside offer, so it is a viable counteroffer. My counteroffer is that I will give Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   I will make the counteroffer as calculated above.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 494. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 519 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 0, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Since it is round 2, the discount factor to apply is gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

I am going to start by calculating my value for keeping everything except 1 unit of each item, which is what they just offered me, so I know that is at least acceptable to them.\n    *   Keeping all items except [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]:\n        *   Items I keep: [1, 5, 0, 4, 1]\n        *   My value: (1 * 15) + (5 * 24) + (0 * 20) + (4 * 78) + (1 * 36) = 15 + 120 + 0 + 312 + 36 = 483\n\n      This is still less than my outside offer of 494.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 285\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 4\n    *   Item 2: 13\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 31\n    *   Item 5: 24\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 6\n    *   Item 4: 4\n    *   Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of that same offer in round 1. Round 3 will be worth 0.81 times.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 2, 3, 2, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 6 - 3 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 3 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n    My total value for this offer is:\n    (3 * 4) + (2 * 13) + (3 * 5) + (2 * 31) + (2 * 24) = 12 + 26 + 15 + 62 + 48 = 163\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (163) is much less than my outside offer (285). Accepting would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\nNow let's consider potential counteroffers. I want to create a counteroffer that will get me more value than the outside offer. I should try to keep the items that I value the most. For example, let's calculate the value if I keep [4, 3, 4, 3, 2]\n\nMy total value would be: (4 * 4) + (3 * 13) + (4 * 5) + (3 * 31) + (2 * 24) = 16 + 39 + 20 + 93 + 48 = 216. This is still less than my outside offer. Let's try offering [2, 1, 2, 1, 0] giving me [4,3,4,3,3]\n(4 * 4) + (3 * 13) + (4 * 5) + (3 * 31) + (3 * 24) = 16 + 39 + 20 + 93 + 72 = 240, still lower than 285.\n\nLet's try [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] which means I keep [5, 4, 5, 4, 3]\n(5*4) + (4*13) + (5*5) + (4*31) + (3*24) = 20+52+25+124+72= 293. This is better than the outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer, so I will reject it.\n*   Walking away now means I get 285, which is better than the current offer.\n*   I should offer a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer of 285.\n\nMy counteroffer will be to give Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 0].  My value if I keep the rest of items will be (5*4)+(4*13)+(5*5)+(4*31)+(3*24) = 293, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 756. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 942 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 0 + 86 x 1 + 81 x 5 + 25 x 3 + 63 x 3\n    which is 755 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 756. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 3, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

If I offer [2, 1, 2, 1, 0], then I would keep [4, 3, 4, 3, 3].\n         The value is (4*4) + (3*13) + (4*5) + (3*31) + (3*24) = 16 + 39 + 20 + 93 + 72 = 240. \n    This is worse than my outside offer.\n   \n    *  Let's offer [2, 0, 2, 0, 0], keeping [4, 4, 4, 4, 3]. The value is (4*4) + (4*13) + (4*5) + (4*31) + (3*24) = 16 + 52 + 20 + 124 + 72 = 284. Still worse than 285.\n   \n    *   Let's offer [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I keep [5, 4, 5, 4, 3]. The value is 5*4 + 4*13 + 5*5 + 4*31 + 3*24 = 20 + 52 + 25 + 124 + 72 = 293, which is better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer has a discounted value of 194.4, which is much worse than my outside offer of 285. Therefore I will not accept.\n*   My offer from round 1, [1, 0, 1, 0, 0], yields a value of 293, which is also better than my outside offer.\n    Therefore, I will propose [1,0,1,0,0] again, since the opponent has not made an offer beneficial to me.\n    The value if I keep [5,4,5,4,3] is 293.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 756. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 942 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 0 + 86 x 1 + 81 x 5 + 25 x 3 + 63 x 3\n    which is 755 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 756. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 3, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best action for Player 1 in this final round.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 756. This is my guaranteed fallback if no deal is reached.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 59\n    *   Item 2: 86\n    *   Item 3: 81\n    *   Item 4: 25\n    *   Item 5: 63\n*   **Total Items:** There are 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. Since this is round 3, any deal we make will be multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer gives me [1, 0, 1, 0, 0].  This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n\n    The total value of this offer for me is:\n    (5 * 59) + (4 * 86) + (5 * 81) + (4 * 25) + (3 * 63) = 295 + 344 + 405 + 100 + 189 = 1333.\n    \n    Accounting for the discount factor, the present value is 1333 * 0.81 = 1079.73\n\n*   **Counteroffers:** Since this is the last round, any counteroffer that Player 2 does not accept will automatically result in a walk (and I will get my outside offer). Therefore, I need to consider whether any possible counteroffer is likely to be accepted, or if I should just accept the current offer.  \n\n    A good strategy here is to ensure that I make an offer better than my outside offer and consider what I think the other player might accept. In the past two rounds, Player 2 has offered only [1,0,1,0,0], which suggests a low value for items.\n\n    Let's consider the value of keeping everything for myself:\n    (6 * 59) + (4 * 86) + (6 * 81) + (4 * 25) + (3 * 63) = 354 + 344 + 486 + 100 + 189 = 1473.\n    Discounted, this is 1473 * 0.81 = 1193.13\n\n    An offer similar to my last offer of [2, 1, 2, 1, 1] gives me:\n    (4 * 59) + (3 * 86) + (4 * 81) + (3 * 25) + (2 * 63) = 236 + 258 + 324 + 75 + 126 = 1019.\n    Discounted, this is 1019 * 0.81 = 825.39\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n    *   The current offer is worth 1079.73 discounted, which is better than my outside offer of 756.\n    *   Keeping everything is worth 1193.13 discounted, which is also better than my outside offer.\n    *   An offer similar to my last offer is worth 825.39 discounted, which is better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is better than my outside offer, and the discounted value (1079.73) is quite high, it is not worth the risk of losing this deal by trying to get an offer closer to keeping everything.\n\nTherefore, I should ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 0 + 91 x 1 + 98 x 1 + 38 x 0 + 1 x 0\n    which is 189 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 190. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and make an informed decision.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 190.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are 72 for item 1, 91 for item 2, 98 for item 3, 38 for item 4, and 1 for item 5.\n*   **Total pool of items:** 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1. This means the present value in round 1 is not discounted.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]. This means they are keeping: [3, 3, 1, 3, 3].  Let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 72 = 72\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 91 = 91\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 98 = 98\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 38 = 114\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 1 = 1\n    *   Total value of current offer: 72 + 91 + 98 + 114 + 1 = 376\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer of 190, and also be a reasonable one to propose to player 1. I'll need to keep this in mind, and ensure the offer isn't much worse for myself or not worse. \n\n    * **Counteroffer 1 (Equal split on my highest value items):** Let's try keeping [2,2,1,3,2] and offering [2,2,1,3,2] to Player 1. My value here is:\n        * 2 * 72 = 144\n        * 2 * 91 = 182\n        * 1 * 98 = 98\n        * 3 * 38 = 114\n        * 2 * 1 = 2\n        * Total: 540\n\n    * **Counteroffer 2 (Keeping as much of high items as possible while offering a reasonable portion of low items):** I will keep [3, 3, 2, 0, 0] and offer [1, 1, 0, 6, 4]. My Value here:\n       * 3 * 72 = 216\n       * 3 * 91 = 273\n       * 2 * 98 = 196\n       * 0 * 38 = 0\n       * 0 * 1 = 0\n       * Total = 685\n\n    * **Counteroffer 3 (Slightly worse than counteroffer 2) :** I will keep [3, 2, 1, 1, 0] and offer [1, 2, 1, 5, 4]. My Value here:\n       * 3 * 72 = 216\n       * 2 * 91 = 182\n       * 1 * 98 = 98\n       * 1 * 38 = 38\n       * 0 * 1 = 0\n       * Total = 534\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (376) and all considered counteroffers above (540, 685, and 534) are all much higher than my outside offer value of 190.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 376, which is greater than my outside offer of 190. Therefore, accepting it is not a mistake. However, I will explore making a counteroffer since I believe I can do better.\n* Counteroffers 1-3 are all greater than my outside offer, so proposing any of them would be reasonable. I will choose counteroffer 2 as it maximizes my value while also not being too much better for me, or worse for player 1 (in terms of unit counts). \n\nTherefore, I will make counteroffer 2 which is giving [1, 1, 0, 6, 4] to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 6, 4]}\n```\n",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 6, 4]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 190\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 72\n    *   Item 2: 91\n    *   Item 3: 98\n    *   Item 4: 38\n    *   Item 5: 1\n*   **Total item pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 4\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 2\n    *   Item 4: 6\n    *   Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor is gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 6 - 0 = 6\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n    My total value for this offer before discount = (3 * 72) + (3 * 91) + (1 * 98) + (6 * 38) + (3 * 1) = 216 + 273 + 98 + 228 + 3 = 818. Applying discount factor: 818 * 0.9 = 736.2. This is much better than my outside option.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    *   To avoid Mistake 3, I shouldn't offer [0,0,0,0,0] or [4,4,2,6,4].\n    *   My previous counteroffer was [1, 1, 0, 6, 4], which means I was keeping [3, 3, 2, 0, 0].\n    The value for that offer was 3*72+3*91+2*98+0*38+0*1 = 216+273+196 = 685. Applying discount factor: 685 * 0.9 = 616.5. This is better than my outside option of 190.\n    *   Let's consider making a counteroffer that will give me more of the items I value highly. For instance, what if I offer to give Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]? This means I would keep [4, 4, 2, 4, 4].\n    My value is: 4*72 + 4*91 + 2*98 + 4*38 + 4*1 = 288 + 364 + 196 + 152 + 4 = 1004. Discounted value is 1004 * 0.9 = 903.6.\n    *   Let's consider making a counteroffer that will give me more of the items I value highly, while giving some to player 1.  How about [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]?  I would keep [3,3,2,5,3]. Value = 3*72+3*91+2*98+5*38+3*1 = 216+273+196+190+3 = 878. Discounted value is 878 * 0.9 = 790.2. This is much better than my outside offer.\n    *   How about [0,0,0,0,0]? This gives me 4*72+4*91+2*98+6*38+4*1= 288+364+196+228+4 = 1080. Discounted value is 1080 * 0.9 = 972.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer [1,1,1,0,1] gives me a discounted value of 736.2, which is better than my outside option of 190.\n*   The counteroffer [1, 1, 0, 1, 1] gives me a discounted value of 790.2, which is better than the current offer.\n*   The counteroffer [0,0,0,0,0] gives me a discounted value of 972, which is much better than current offer. Since it is round 2, I will offer [0,0,0,0,0] and walk if that is not accepted in the final round.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 232. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 333 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 6, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 6, 5, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 1 + 9 x 6 + 25 x 5 + 41 x 4 + 75 x 4\n    which is 679 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 683. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 4, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 4, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 683\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 36, Item 2: 9, Item 3: 25, Item 4: 41, Item 5: 75\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 1, Item 2: 7, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that if we reach a deal in round 2, the value will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. If we reach a deal in round 3, the value will be multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81. This means that deals made earlier are more valuable, assuming the same nominal value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 4, 4, 0].\n    This means I keep: [1, 6, 1, 0, 4]\n    My value if I accept is: (1 * 36) + (6 * 9) + (1 * 25) + (0 * 41) + (4 * 75) = 36 + 54 + 25 + 0 + 300 = 415\n\n*   **Comparing to my outside offer:** My outside offer is 683. The current offer's value of 415 is significantly less than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible. Accepting it would be Mistake 4, accepting an offer worse than your outside offer.\n*   I should not walk away, because it's only round 1, and I can make a counteroffer.\n*   I need to propose a counteroffer that is better for me than my outside option.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer. I need to keep enough of the items to have value greater than 683. I should keep at least one of item 5 because that is my most valuable item, and I will try to keep as many as possible of the high value items.\nLet's say I propose to keep [1, 6, 1, 0, 4], which is the current state, but reject the current offer. I already computed that this is a value of 415, so that is not an improvement. I need to propose a counteroffer in which I keep more. \nLet's try keeping [1, 6, 5, 0, 4]. Value = 36 + 54 + 125 + 0 + 300 = 515, still not high enough.\nLet's try keeping [1, 7, 5, 4, 4], Value = 36 + 63 + 125 + 164 + 300 = 688. This is greater than my outside offer! This means that I can give away [0,0,0,0,0] and not make mistake 2.\nLet's try to keep slightly less. Let's try [1, 6, 4, 0, 4]. Value = 36 + 54 + 100 + 0 + 300 = 490. Still not great.\nLet's try a counter offer of giving the other player [0,0,0,0,0]. This means keeping all the items. Value = 36 + 63 + 125 + 164 + 300 = 688. This is above my outside offer, and a valid offer.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer that keeps all the items for myself.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Your value would be:\n    36 x 1 + 9 x 6 + 25 x 5 + 41 x 4 + 75 x 4\n    which is 679 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 683. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 4, 4, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 683\n*   **My item values:** \n    *   Item 1: 36\n    *   Item 2: 9\n    *   Item 3: 25\n    *   Item 4: 41\n    *   Item 5: 75\n*   **Total pool of items:** 1 unit of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means the value of any agreement is multiplied by 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 2, 3, 2, 1]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 7 - 2 = 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    My value for this offer is:\n    (1 * 36) + (5 * 9) + (2 * 25) + (2 * 41) + (3 * 75) = 36 + 45 + 50 + 82 + 225 = 438.\n    Discounted value: 438 * 0.9 = 394.2\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of accepting the current offer (394.2) is less than my outside offer (683). This means accepting the current offer is Mistake 4 (accepting an offer worse than my outside offer).\n\n* **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to make a counteroffer with a value greater than 683 * 0.9 = 614.7 to ensure that it is beneficial given the time discount. I am looking to give as little to the opponent as possible while making it better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's evaluate keeping most items:\n    * Keeping 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 36 = 36\n    * Keeping 5 units of item 2: 5 * 9 = 45\n    * Keeping 4 units of item 3: 4 * 25 = 100\n    * Keeping 3 units of item 4: 3 * 41 = 123\n    * Keeping 3 units of item 5: 3 * 75 = 225\nTotal: 529\n\nThis is less than my outside offer even after accounting for the discount factor, thus a bad offer.\n\nLet's try to give them only 1 unit of item 2:\n    * Keeping 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 36 = 36\n    * Keeping 6 units of item 2: 6 * 9 = 54\n    * Keeping 5 units of item 3: 5 * 25 = 125\n    * Keeping 4 units of item 4: 4 * 41 = 164\n    * Keeping 4 units of item 5: 4 * 75 = 300\nTotal: 679\n\nThis is better than my outside offer after accounting for discount factor, but since I want to leave them with as little as possible, I will offer them 1 item of item 2. This means I would keep [1,6,5,4,4] which would be worth 679, discounted as 679*0.9 = 611.1. Since that is less than my outside offer and the game will end if I counteroffer now, this is still bad.\n\nLets try giving 0 of item 2, giving me [1,7,5,4,4] which means I get\n36 + 63 + 125 + 164 + 300 = 688 which is above my outside offer, discounted as 688*0.9 = 619.2.\n\nSince I need a value greater than 683*0.9 = 614.7, and giving them 0 of item 2 and keeping the other units will result in a better payoff than my outside offer, this would be a good counteroffer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer (Mistake 4)\n*   Making a counteroffer is better than walking away because I can make a counteroffer better than my outside offer.\n*   Therefore I will propose a counteroffer.\n\nMy counteroffer should leave me with the most value greater than 614.7, which is what I get when I give Player 1, 0 item 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

I will consider a range of potential counteroffers to see if they pass the outside option.\n\n    Let's try a few examples (keeping in mind my goal is to maximize my value) and calculate what I would be left with after the division:\n\n    *   **Offer 1: Offer player 2 one of each item.**\n        I keep 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\n        My value: (3 * 66) + (2 * 84) + (1 * 14) + (2 * 61) + (3 * 19) = 198 + 168 + 14 + 122 + 57 = 559\n\n    *   **Offer 2: Offer player 2 2 units of each item (where possible):**\n        I keep 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 2 of item 5.\n         My value: (2 * 66) + (1 * 84) + (0 * 14) + (1 * 61) + (2 * 19) = 132 + 84 + 0 + 61 + 38 = 315\n\n     * **Offer 3: Offer player 2 1 unit of items 1, 2, and 4 and 0 units of 3 and 5.**\n        I keep 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 4 of item 5\n         My value: (3 * 66) + (2 * 84) + (2 * 14) + (2 * 61) + (4 * 19) = 198 + 168 + 28 + 122 + 76 = 592\n    * **Offer 4: Offer player 2 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 of 4, and 0 of 5**\n        I keep 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 4 of item 5\n         My value: (3 * 66) + (2 * 84) + (1 * 14) + (3 * 61) + (4 * 19) = 198 + 168 + 14 + 183 + 76 = 639\n\n    All of these offers are better than my outside offer value, so are acceptable to start with, and will allow the negotiation to continue. I will go with offer 4.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will not accept since there is no current offer.\n*   I will not walk away as there is a possibility for value creation.\n*   I will propose counteroffer 4 which gives Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    98 x 1 + 31 x 0 + 69 x 2 + 33 x 3 + 98 x 4\n    which is 727 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 730. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    98 x 1 + 31 x 0 + 69 x 2 + 33 x 3 + 98 x 4\n    which is 727 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 730. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 730\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 98, Item 2: 31, Item 3: 69, Item 4: 33, Item 5: 98\n*   **Total items:** 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 4 of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, any deal will be discounted by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n    *   My value from the offer: (0 * 98) + (1 * 31) + (0 * 69) + (0 * 33) + (0 * 98) = 31\n    *   Discounted value: 31 * 0.9 = 27.9\n    *   This is *much* worse than my outside offer of 730.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    Let's consider some counteroffer examples:\n    *   **Counteroffer 1: Keep [4, 3, 2, 3, 4], offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:** This means I keep everything for myself.\n        *   My value: (4 * 98) + (3 * 31) + (2 * 69) + (3 * 33) + (4 * 98) = 392 + 93 + 138 + 99 + 392 = 1114\n        *   Discounted value: 1114 * 0.9 = 1002.6 This is better than my outside offer. \n    *  **Counteroffer 2: Keep [3, 2, 1, 2, 3], Offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]:**\n         *  My value: (3 * 98) + (2 * 31) + (1 * 69) + (2 * 33) + (3 * 98) = 294 + 62 + 69 + 66 + 294 = 785\n         *  Discounted Value: 785 * 0.9 = 706.5. This is worse than my outside offer of 730.\n    * Let's try to keep more to make sure we don't offer something below our outside offer, so let's try keeping 4 of each item while we have 4 to give away. For item 2, we only have 3, and item 3, we have 2, so we will keep these all.\n    * **Counteroffer 3: Keep [4, 3, 2, 2, 4], Offer [0,0,0,1,0]**:\n        *My value: (4 * 98) + (3 * 31) + (2 * 69) + (2 * 33) + (4*98) = 392 + 93 + 138 + 66 + 392 = 1081\n        *Discounted value = 1081 * 0.9 = 972.9\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible for me, giving a discounted value of only 27.9. I should absolutely not accept. My outside option guarantees a value of 730. I need to make a counteroffer that is at least as good as my outside offer. Counteroffer 1 is great. Counteroffer 2 is below my outside option, so that is not a good option. Counteroffer 3 is also great. Let's propose counteroffer 3 since it offers something to the opponent. If they don't accept, I can always walk away next turn if I have to and get my outside offer of 730.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

This means that a deal in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times the face value, and a deal in round 3 will be worth 0.81 times the face value.  Since it is round 1, the value is currently undiscounted.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer, and it needs to be better than my outside offer. I will consider a few counteroffers.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I need to make the first move. I will try to construct an offer that is advantageous to me. I will first try an offer where I give Player 2 half of each type of item.\n\nIf I offered 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5 to Player 2. I would keep:\n\n*   Item 1: 7 - 3 = 4 units\n*   Item 2: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n*   Item 3: 9 - 4 = 5 units\n*   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n*   Item 5: 7 - 3 = 4 units\n\nMy value for keeping this would be:\n(4 * 46) + (3 * 44) + (5 * 80) + (2 * 100) + (4 * 52) = 184 + 132 + 400 + 200 + 208 = 1124\n\nThis is much better than my outside offer of 155, so this is a reasonable starting point, I will offer Player 2 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5\n\n**Decision:**\nI will make a counteroffer as described above.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 4, 2, 3]}\n```\n",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 0 + 80 x 0 + 17 x 0 + 80 x 0 + 95 x 7\n    which is 665 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 666. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 5, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 0 + 72 x 2 + 62 x 5 + 65 x 3 + 78 x 1\n    which is 727 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 728. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This is much less than my outside offer.\n*  **Potential Counteroffers:** I want an offer that is greater than my outside offer. It makes sense to try to keep the majority of the valuable items for myself.  Let's first try offering the other player only the least valuable items (item 3), giving them all item 3s in order to test a threshold, keeping all others for myself. This would mean my counteroffer is [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]. If this is accepted, my value will be:\n     (3 * 66) + (5 * 72) + (0 * 62) + (4 * 65) + (2 * 78) = 198 + 360 + 0 + 260 + 156 = 974.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n    * The current offer of 62 is significantly below my outside offer of 728, making it unacceptable.\n    * My potential counteroffer of [0, 0, 6, 0, 0] gives me a value of 974, which is significantly above my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer [0, 0, 6, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Let's calculate how much I would get from keeping all items:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 66 = 198\n    *   5 units of item 2: 5 * 72 = 360\n    *   6 units of item 3: 6 * 62 = 372\n    *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 65 = 260\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 78 = 156\n    *   Total value: 198 + 360 + 372 + 260 + 156 = 1346\n    *   Discounted Value: 1346 * 0.9 = 1211.4\n\n    Since the current offer gives me a discounted value of 1152.9 which is better than my outside offer of 728, I should not walk away or make a counteroffer worse than this. I need to assess whether I can get a better deal. Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep most of the items. For example, if I offer player 1 [0,0,1,0,0], I get \n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 66 = 198\n    *   5 units of item 2: 5 * 72 = 360\n    *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 62 = 310\n    *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 65 = 260\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 78 = 156\n    *   Total value: 198 + 360 + 310 + 260 + 156 = 1284\n    *   Discounted value: 1284 * 0.9 = 1155.6\n\n   This counteroffer is better for me than accepting the current offer, as its discounted value is greater than my discounted offer of 1152.9.\n   I can't get a significantly better deal by changing the number of item 3, as it has relatively low value.\n    Let's calculate what happens if I offer [0,1,0,0,0]\n   * 3 units of item 1: 3 * 66 = 198\n    * 4 units of item 2: 4 * 72 = 288\n    * 6 units of item 3: 6 * 62 = 372\n    * 4 units of item 4: 4 * 65 = 260\n    * 2 units of item 5: 2 * 78 = 156\n    * Total value = 198 + 288 + 372 + 260 + 156 = 1274\n    * Discounted Value = 1274 * 0.9 = 1146.6\n\nThis is less than my current offer. Therefore, I should offer [0,0,1,0,0].\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] gives a discounted value of 1152.9 which is above my outside offer of 728.\n*   A counter offer of [0,0,1,0,0] gives me a discounted value of 1155.6, which is better than the current offer.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 389. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This is good for me, and more than the value I get if I accept the current offer.\n    *   **Counteroffer 2:** Offer [0, 1, 0, 2, 1] (which is what they offered me). This would mean I keep:\n        Value: 465\n    *   **Counteroffer 3:** Offer [1, 2, 0, 2, 1] (what I offered in the previous round).

Both counteroffers 2 and 3 are less than counteroffer 1, which is more than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI should not accept the current offer because it is worse for me than counteroffer 1. I should not walk away because the current offer (after discounting) is better than my outside offer. I should make the best counter offer, so I'll make counteroffer 1, which gives everything to the other player, leaving me with all the items and a value of 727, which is larger than the discounted value of 418.5 I would get from the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 389. This is my guaranteed value if negotiations fail.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 62\n    *   Item 2: 81\n    *   Item 3: 87\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 9\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since it's round 2, if we reach an agreement now, the discount factor would be gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would receive nothing from the deal.\n    *   My value if I accept: 0. Since this is worse than my outside offer, accepting it would be a mistake.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to make a counteroffer that's better than my outside offer of 389 after the discount. Let's calculate the value of keeping all the items:\n    *   2 * 62 + 4 * 81 + 1 * 87 + 4 * 5 + 3 * 9 = 124 + 324 + 87 + 20 + 27 = 582\n\nSince I know the max possible value for me is 582, any offer I make must leave me with a value of at least 389 / 0.9 = 432.22 in this round to be better than my outside offer. Let's try a few options:\n\n    *   **Option 1:** I keep [2, 4, 1, 4, 3]. This gives me a value of 582. Value after discount is 582*0.9 = 523.8\n    *   **Option 2:** I keep [2, 3, 1, 3, 3] and offer [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. My value is 2*62 + 3*81 + 1*87 + 3*5 + 3*9 = 124 + 243 + 87 + 15 + 27 = 496. Value after discount is 496*0.9= 446.4\n    *    **Option 3:** I keep [1, 2, 1, 3, 2] and offer [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]. My value is 1*62 + 2*81 + 1*87 + 3*5 + 2*9 = 62 + 162 + 87 + 15 + 18 = 344. Value after discount is 344*0.9 = 309.6. This is worse than my outside offer, so it's not good enough.\n\nSince I want to maximize value, and an offer of keeping all the items gives me the best outcome, I will keep as much of the valuable items as possible. I will offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is worse than my outside offer. Accepting this would be a mistake.\n*   Walking away would result in my outside offer of 389.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\nI will make a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 913. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 738 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 5, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 4 + 47 x 5 + 52 x 5 + 56 x 0 + 52 x 5\n    which is 911 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 913. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This encourages reaching a deal sooner rather than later, if profitable. At the first round, this is less of a concern though.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    * I need to consider possible counteroffers, calculating the value of what I keep and ensuring that it exceeds my outside offer.\n\n**Let's consider a few example counteroffers and evaluate their value to me:**\n\n* **Example 1:** Offer Player 2 half of each item (where possible), which would be [2, 3, 2, 0, 2], meaning I keep [3, 4, 3, 0, 3]. My value would be: 3 * 39 + 4 * 47 + 3 * 52 + 0 * 56 + 3 * 52 = 117 + 188 + 156 + 0 + 156 = 617. This is less than my outside offer of 913, thus it's not a viable offer.\n\n* **Example 2:** Offer Player 2 [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]. This means I keep [4, 5, 4, 0, 4]. My value would be: 4 * 39 + 5 * 47 + 4 * 52 + 0 * 56 + 4 * 52 = 156 + 235 + 208 + 0 + 208 = 807. This is also less than my outside offer of 913.\n\n* **Example 3:** Offer Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep [5, 6, 5, 0, 5]. My value would be: 5 * 39 + 6 * 47 + 5 * 52 + 0 * 56 + 5 * 52 = 195 + 282 + 260 + 0 + 260 = 997. This is greater than my outside offer of 913 and is thus a viable first round offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince it is round 1, and I want to start with a viable offer that exceeds my outside offer, I will offer Player 2 [0,1,0,0,0] and keep the rest for myself.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

I should seek a balance of a good deal for me and a deal that the other player will find acceptable.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] has a value of 1239 to me. This is better than my outside offer of 514. However, I think I can get a better offer by making a counteroffer.\n*   My potential counteroffer of [0, 0, 2, 0, 2] has a value of 1034 to me. This is also better than my outside offer, and it is likely to be better than what the other player would get if they simply took their outside offer.\n*   Since it is round 1, I want to make an offer to start negotiation.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 913\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 39\n    *   Item 2: 47\n    *   Item 3: 52\n    *   Item 4: 56\n    *   Item 5: 52\n*   **Total items:**\n    *   Item 1: 5\n    *   Item 2: 7\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 0\n    *   Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer now is more valuable than accepting the same offer in the next round. Specifically, if the process concludes after r rounds, the overall value of the negotiation outcome to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1). In the current round (round 2), the value of any agreement will be discounted by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   0 units of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   0 units of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n    The value of this offer to me is:\n    (0 * 39) + (0 * 47) + (2 * 52) + (0 * 56) + (2 * 52) = 0 + 0 + 104 + 0 + 104 = 208.\n    Since it's round 2, this value should be discounted by 0.9:  208 * 0.9 = 187.2.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep most of the high value items for myself, with the goal of exceeding 913, before the discount is applied, in round 2 this will mean trying to get a value that is greater than 913/0.9 = 1014.4\n    I will start by keeping all of item 1, 2, 3, and 5 and offer 0 of those to Player 2, and 0 of item 4 to Player 2.\n        -   This gives me:\n        (5 * 39) + (7 * 47) + (5 * 52) + (0 * 56) + (5 * 52) = 195 + 329 + 260 + 0 + 260 = 1044\n    This is better than my outside offer even with a discount rate of 0.9 applied to round 2.\n    I will offer [0,0,0,0,0] to player 2.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer is worth 187.2, which is much less than my outside offer of 913.\n    *   My potential counteroffer of keeping everything will give me 1044, which is much more than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of 187.2 is far below my outside offer of 913, even considering the discount factor. Accepting this would be a mistake.\n*   My potential counteroffer of giving away nothing gives me 1044, which discounted by 0.9 is 939.6, which is greater than my outside offer, and gives me the best potential outcome as I have an outside offer of 913, so keeping everything is the best outcome for me. I will propose to offer nothing to Player 2.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 514. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 514. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 0 + 79 x 2 + 71 x 0 + 76 x 0 + 71 x 5\n    which is 513 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 514. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 514.\n*   **Item values:** My values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 11\n    *   Item 2: 79\n    *   Item 3: 71\n    *   Item 4: 76\n    *   Item 5: 71\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means I get all the items.\n    My value for keeping all items is: (5 * 11) + (7 * 79) + (5 * 71) + (0 * 76) + (5 * 71) = 55 + 553 + 355 + 0 + 355 = 1318\n    The discounted value of this at round 2 is 1318 * 0.9 = 1186.2. This is much greater than my outside option.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to calculate a counteroffer in order to continue negotiations in an advantageous position. I must make sure my counteroffer does not violate any of the 5 mistakes described above. My previous offer was [0, 0, 2, 0, 2] which corresponds to a value for me of (5*11) + (7*79) + (3*71) + (0*76) + (3*71) = 55 + 553 + 213 + 0 + 213 = 1034.\n    Let's explore a few counteroffers:\n        *   Offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]: My value would be (5 * 11) + (6 * 79) + (5 * 71) + (0 * 76) + (5 * 71) = 55 + 474 + 355 + 0 + 355 = 1239.  The discounted value is 1239 * 0.9 = 1115.1.\n        *   Offer [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]: My value would be (4*11) + (6*79) + (4*71) + (0*76) + (4*71) = 44 + 474 + 284 + 0 + 284 = 1086. The discounted value is 1086 * 0.9 = 977.4.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** \n    * The current offer gives me a value of 1186.2 which is significantly more than my outside offer of 514.\n    * If I counter with [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], my value is 1115.1, also greater than my outside offer.\n    * If I counter with [1, 1, 1, 0, 1], my value is 977.4, also greater than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer [0,0,0,0,0] is extremely favorable for me, with a present value of 1186.2.  Since I am aiming to maximize my payoff and this offer is better than my outside option, it is the best option for me.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This means that if the negotiation takes longer, my value is multiplied by 0.9 each round, so it is in my interest to get a good outcome quickly.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer that gives enough value to player 2 that they will not walk, but also keeps me above my outside option value and is better than walking away.\n\nLet's calculate some example offers and evaluate them, and make sure none of them makes a mistake. Note that I must make the offer to Player 2, which means I keep what is left.\n\n*   **Example 1: Giving Player 2 half of the total items**:\n\n    Offer to Player 2: \\[2, 4, 4, 4, 2]\n\n    My Remaining items: \\[3, 4, 5, 4, 3]\n    My value: (3 * 41) + (4 * 93) + (5 * 60) + (4 * 24) + (3 * 89) = 123 + 372 + 300 + 96 + 267 = 1158. This is much less than my outside offer. This offer is invalid because it is mistake 2.\n\n*   **Example 2: Giving Player 2 a small amount**:\n\n    Offer to Player 2: \\[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n    My Remaining items: \\[4, 7, 8, 7, 4]\n    My value: (4 * 41) + (7 * 93) + (8 * 60) + (7 * 24) + (4 * 89) = 164 + 651 + 480 + 168 + 356 = 1819.

This is less than my outside offer and an invalid move.\n\nI want to make an offer that is better than my outside offer, and also leaves me the most value possible, while giving the other player enough that they will not walk. I will try an offer that gives a little bit of all the items, since all items have positive value to the other player (which I don't know, but assume to be true in principle).\n\n*   **Example 4: Giving Player 2 some of each type of item**:\n\n    Offer to Player 2: \\[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n    My Remaining items: \\[4, 6, 6, 6, 4]\n    My value: (4 * 41) + (6 * 93) + (6 * 60) + (6 * 24) + (4 * 89) = 164 + 558 + 360 + 144 + 356 = 1582. This is better than my outside offer of 1377.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nOffer \\[1, 2, 3, 2, 1] gives me a value of 1582, which is better than my outside offer. It is not excessively generous to Player 2, and is a reasonable opening offer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 0 + 35 x 1 + 67 x 5 + 88 x 3 + 1 x 4\n    which is 638 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 639. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 639\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 52\n    *   Item 2: 35\n    *   Item 3: 67\n    *   Item 4: 88\n    *   Item 5: 1\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 8 units\n    *   Item 3: 9 units\n    *   Item 4: 8 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal we make later will be worth slightly less than a deal made earlier. Specifically, a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its raw value, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.9^2=0.81 times its raw value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] items to *me*. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 8 - 2 = 6 units\n    *   Item 3: 9 - 3 = 6 units\n    *   Item 4: 8 - 2 = 6 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    \n    The value of the current offer to me is:\n    (4 * 52) + (6 * 35) + (6 * 67) + (6 * 88) + (4 * 1) = 208 + 210 + 402 + 528 + 4 = 1352\n\n    Since 1352 > 639, the current offer is better than my outside option.\n\n*  **Potential counteroffers:** I should only make counteroffers that provide me with a value greater than my outside offer of 639.  I must also consider the discount factor for future rounds. Let's consider some potential counteroffers to see if there are better deals available, or if we can get close enough to extract maximum value. I can try to get a better offer, by reducing the number of items I offer to the other player. Here, I will keep as many items as possible, which amounts to a counteroffer. Let's say I offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I will keep [4, 7, 8, 7, 4], leading to:\n\n   (4 * 52) + (7 * 35) + (8 * 67) + (7 * 88) + (4 * 1) = 208 + 245 + 536 + 616 + 4 = 1609.\nThis is a better offer.\n\nI must calculate this offer as discounted by the fact that it is being made in round 2, i.e. 1609 * 0.9 = 1448.1. This is still much higher than my outside offer, so it's ok.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 1352, which is greater than my outside offer of 639. However, I believe I can get a better offer by making a counteroffer.\nMy proposed counteroffer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] is better for me, so there's no mistake in making this offer compared to the status quo, even with the discount factor.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 0 + 35 x 1 + 67 x 5 + 88 x 3 + 1 x 4\n    which is 638 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 639. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This is my guaranteed fallback value if negotiations fail.\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 52, Item 2: 35, Item 3: 67, Item 4: 88, Item 5: 1.\n*   **Total items:** 5 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, any value I receive is multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. The previous round did not result in a deal, so we are in the second round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 2, 1, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit, value = 1 * 52 = 52\n    *   Item 2: 2 units, value = 2 * 35 = 70\n    *   Item 3: 2 units, value = 2 * 67 = 134\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit, value = 1 * 88 = 88\n    *   Item 5: 2 units, value = 2 * 1 = 2\n    *   Total value = 52 + 70 + 134 + 88 + 2 = 346\n    *   Discounted value = 346 * 0.9 = 311.4\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to come up with a counteroffer that is better for me than my outside offer, and better than 311.4 when the discount rate is considered. Let's consider keeping a higher share of the more valuable items.\n    *   If I keep [4, 6, 7, 6, 3]: offer [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n        *   My value: (4 * 52) + (6 * 35) + (7 * 67) + (6 * 88) + (3 * 1) = 208 + 210 + 469 + 528 + 3 = 1418\n        *  Discounted Value: 1418* 0.9 = 1276.2\n\n    * If I keep [3, 5, 6, 5, 2]: offer [2, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n         * My value: (3 * 52) + (5 * 35) + (6 * 67) + (5 * 88) + (2 * 1) = 156 + 175 + 402 + 440 + 2 = 1175\n         * Discounted Value: 1175 * 0.9 = 1057.5\n\n    * If I keep [2, 4, 5, 4, 1] and offer [3, 4, 4, 4, 4]:\n         * My value: (2 * 52) + (4 * 35) + (5 * 67) + (4 * 88) + (1 * 1) = 104+140+335+352+1 = 932\n         * Discounted Value: 932 * 0.9 = 838.8\n   \n    *  If I keep [2, 5, 7, 7, 4] and offer [3, 3, 2, 1, 1]\n        *   My value: (2 * 52) + (5 * 35) + (7 * 67) + (7 * 88) + (4 * 1) = 104+175+469+616+4 = 1368\n        *  Discounted Value: 1368* 0.9 = 1231.2\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 311.4, which is much lower than my outside offer of 639, and much worse than potential counteroffers. Thus, accepting the current offer is not an option.\n*   I should not walk away because it is possible to achieve a better value than 639.\n*   I will offer [3, 3, 2, 1, 1], which is a counteroffer that provides a much higher discounted value than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 2, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

This means any deal in later rounds will be worth slightly less than a deal in earlier rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so I have nothing to assess.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since there is no current offer, I have to make an initial offer to Player 2. I want to make an offer that keeps me at least my outside offer value while still leaving room for negotiation.\n\n    I'll calculate the value of keeping various amounts of items to ensure my offer gives me at least the outside value. I will start by keeping the majority of all the items for myself. Here's how to do that:\n     * Keep 4 Item 1: 4 * 60 = 240\n     * Keep 3 Item 2: 3 * 31 = 93\n     * Keep 6 Item 3: 6 * 85 = 510\n     * Keep 1 Item 4: 1 * 31 = 31\n     * Keep 4 Item 5: 4 * 28 = 112\n     Total value = 240 + 93 + 510 + 31 + 112 = 986\n     This keeps the bulk of the items for myself.\n\n     Now, I will try keeping slightly less:\n    * Keep 3 Item 1: 3 * 60 = 180\n    * Keep 2 Item 2: 2 * 31 = 62\n    * Keep 5 Item 3: 5 * 85 = 425\n    * Keep 1 Item 4: 1 * 31 = 31\n    * Keep 4 Item 5: 4 * 28 = 112\n    Total value = 180 + 62 + 425 + 31 + 112 = 810\n    This is still greater than 432.\n\n    Another option.\n    * Keep 2 Item 1: 2 * 60 = 120\n    * Keep 1 Item 2: 1 * 31 = 31\n    * Keep 3 Item 3: 3 * 85 = 255\n    * Keep 1 Item 4: 1 * 31 = 31\n    * Keep 2 Item 5: 2 * 28 = 56\n    Total value = 120 + 31 + 255 + 31 + 56 = 493.\n\n    This is also over 432, so I will try making a slightly more generous offer to Player 2:\n     * Offer 2 Item 1: to keep 2\n     * Offer 2 Item 2: to keep 1\n     * Offer 6 Item 3: to keep 3\n     * Offer 0 Item 4: to keep 1\n     * Offer 4 Item 5: to keep 2\n     Keeping [2, 1, 3, 1, 2] items gives me a value of 493.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that gives me a value of 493 which is larger than my outside option, while also offering some items to Player 2.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 6, 0, 4]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1037. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1005 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 8, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 4 + 82 x 2 + 39 x 8 + 26 x 0 + 96 x 2\n    which is 1036 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1037. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 6, 0, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 5, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 5, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 5, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1037\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 92, Item 2: 82, Item 3: 39, Item 4: 26, Item 5: 96\n*   **Total item pool:** 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 6 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be applied as 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 5, 1, 4]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 92 = 92\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 82 = 82\n    *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 39 = 195\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 26 = 26\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 96 = 384\n    *   Total value of current offer: 92 + 82 + 195 + 26 + 384 = 779\n    *   Discounted value of the current offer: 779 * 0.9 = 701.1\n\n    Since 701.1 < 1037, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away (mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine a counteroffer that would be better for me than my outside offer (1037), while also avoiding making an offer worse than my previous one. My previous offer gave away [1, 1, 5, 1, 1]. I need to make an offer that gives me more than 1037.\n    Let's evaluate what happens if I propose an offer that gives the other player [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything.\n     * 4 units of item 1: 4 * 92 = 368\n    * 3 units of item 2: 3 * 82 = 246\n    * 9 units of item 3: 9 * 39 = 351\n    * 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 26 = 26\n    * 6 units of item 5: 6 * 96 = 576\n    * Total value of keeping everything : 368+246+351+26+576 = 1567. Discounted value = 1567 * 0.9 = 1410.3\n    This is better than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try an offer that is slightly more reasonable, let's give the other player [0, 1, 4, 0, 2].\n    This means I keep:\n    * 4 units of item 1: 4 * 92 = 368\n    * 2 units of item 2: 2 * 82 = 164\n    * 5 units of item 3: 5 * 39 = 195\n    * 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 26 = 26\n    * 4 units of item 5: 4 * 96 = 384\n    * Total value = 368+164+195+26+384 = 1137. Discounted value = 1137 * 0.9 = 1023.3. This is lower than my outside offer so I'll iterate.\n\n    Let's try an offer of [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] to the other player:\n    This means I keep:\n    * 4 units of item 1: 4 * 92 = 368\n    * 3 units of item 2: 3 * 82 = 246\n    * 8 units of item 3: 8 * 39 = 312\n    * 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 26 = 26\n    * 6 units of item 5: 6 * 96 = 576\n    * Total value = 368 + 246 + 312 + 26 + 576 = 1528. Discounted value = 1528 * 0.9 = 1375.2\n    This is better than my outside offer.\n\n    Since I want to make an offer that is better than the current one I will offer [0, 1, 4, 0, 2] this gives me the value of 1023.3. I will stick with my first offer and give [0, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 701.1 to me, which is worse than my outside offer of 1037. I will make a counteroffer to get more. My previous counteroffer was [1, 1, 5, 1, 1]. I will offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This gives me value of 1375.2\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 198\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 31\n    *   Item 2: 79\n    *   Item 3: 53\n    *   Item 4: 93\n    *   Item 5: 33\n*   **Total item pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 7 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 0 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal made in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its immediate value, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its immediate value. Therefore it is better to reach a deal sooner rather than later, if possible.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would keep and what I would offer to the other player. My goal is to maximize my own value while avoiding the five mistakes. I should aim for offers that result in a total value higher than my outside offer value of 198.\n    *   I could start by keeping a significant portion and seeing if player 2 accepts this. Given the items are not of equal value, I need to keep a large portion of my high value items. Let's start with:\n         *   Keeping 3 units of item 1 (3 * 31 = 93)\n         *   Keeping 5 units of item 2 (5 * 79 = 395)\n         *   Keeping 4 units of item 3 (4 * 53 = 212)\n         *   Keeping 2 units of item 4 (2 * 93 = 186)\n         *   Keeping 0 units of item 5 (0 * 33 = 0)\n         This yields a value of 93+395+212+186+0= 886\n\n    This would result in an offer of [0, 2, 2, 2, 0]. My payoff for this deal would be 886, much higher than my outside offer of 198. Since this is the first round, it would be foolish to accept a deal for this much less than I could get.\n        \n    Now lets consider an offer where I give a bit more to the other player:\n         *   Keeping 2 units of item 1 (2 * 31 = 62)\n         *   Keeping 4 units of item 2 (4 * 79 = 316)\n         *   Keeping 3 units of item 3 (3 * 53 = 159)\n         *   Keeping 1 units of item 4 (1 * 93 = 93)\n         *   Keeping 0 units of item 5 (0 * 33 = 0)\n         This yields a value of 62+316+159+93+0 = 630\n   This would result in an offer of [1, 3, 3, 3, 0]. This is also good and better than my outside offer so it would be acceptable to proceed with this. Lets go with this offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept any offer because there is no offer.\n*   I should not walk away because I think I can do better than 198.\n*   I should propose the following counteroffer, which gives a significant portion to player 2 while securing a good outcome for myself and avoids mistakes 1-5:\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 3, 3, 0]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 449. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 593. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 593. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 654 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 0, 6, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 1 + 58 x 3 + 18 x 0 + 48 x 6 + 12 x 4\n    which is 592 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 593. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step and determine the optimal action for Player 1 in Round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 593\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 82\n    *   Item 2: 58\n    *   Item 3: 18\n    *   Item 4: 48\n    *   Item 5: 12\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 7 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. In round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1. This means the value of a deal made now isn't discounted. If the negotiation went to a second round, the value of a deal would be discounted to 0.9 times its actual value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so there is nothing to accept.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate some potential counteroffers to determine my optimal action. I want to find an offer that gives the other player enough value to consider accepting but leaves me with more than my outside offer. Here are some examples:\n    *   **Offer 1: [1, 1, 1, 3, 3]** (Player 2 receives 1 item 1, 1 item 2, 1 item 3, 3 item 4, 3 item 5.)\n        *   I keep: 2-1=1 of item 1, 3-1=2 of item 2, 2-1=1 of item 3, 7-3=4 of item 4, 6-3=3 of item 5.\n        *   My value: (1 * 82) + (2 * 58) + (1 * 18) + (4 * 48) + (3 * 12) = 82 + 116 + 18 + 192 + 36 = 444\n        *   This is less than my outside offer of 593. This is not a good offer.\n    *   **Offer 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]** (Offer nothing to Player 2).\n        *  I keep: 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 7 of item 4, 6 of item 5.\n        *   My value: (2 * 82) + (3 * 58) + (2 * 18) + (7 * 48) + (6 * 12) = 164 + 174 + 36 + 336 + 72 = 782\n        *   This is better than my outside offer. This offer is potentially disadvantageous if Player 2 walks away.\n     *  **Offer 3: [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]** (Player 2 receives 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5)\n          *   I keep: 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n          *   My value: (1 * 82) + (2 * 58) + (2 * 18) + (4 * 48) + (4 * 12) = 82 + 116 + 36 + 192 + 48 = 474\n          *  This is less than my outside offer of 593. Not a good offer.\n     * **Offer 4: [0, 1, 1, 3, 2]** (Player 2 receives 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5)\n          * I keep: 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n          * My value: (2*82) + (2*58) + (1*18) + (4*48) + (4*12) = 164 + 116 + 18 + 192 + 48 = 538\n          * This is also less than my outside offer.\n    *   **Offer 5: [1, 0, 0, 2, 2]** (Player 2 gets 1 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 2 of item 5.)\n        *  I keep: 1 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\n        *   My value: (1 * 82) + (3 * 58) + (2 * 18) + (5 * 48) + (4 * 12) = 82 + 174 + 36 + 240 + 48 = 580\n        *   This is less than my outside offer of 593. Not a good offer.\n    *   **Offer 6: [0, 1, 0, 3, 1]** (Player 2 gets 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 1 of item 5)\n         * I keep 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n         * My value = (2 * 82) + (2 * 58) + (2 * 18) + (4 * 48) + (5 * 12) = 164 + 116 + 36 + 192 + 60 = 568\n         * This is also less than my outside offer.\n    *   **Offer 7: [0, 0, 1, 2, 1]** (Player 2 gets 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 1 of item 5)\n          * I keep 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n          * My value = (2 * 82) + (3 * 58) + (1 * 18) + (5 * 48) + (5 * 12) = 164 + 174 + 18 + 240 + 60 = 656\n          * This is greater than my outside offer. This offer is acceptable.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nBased on the analysis, Offer 7 is the first one that gives me more than my outside offer. I don't want to make mistake 2 and offer a deal that is worse than my outside offer. I also want to try and give Player 2 some items to get them to agree to the deal. Offer 7, [0, 0, 1, 2, 1], seems like a good starting point for the negotiation. It's better than my outside offer and gives the other player a significant amount of the total items.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 593. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 654 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 0, 6, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 1 + 58 x 3 + 18 x 0 + 48 x 6 + 12 x 4\n    which is 592 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 593. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 593\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 82\n    *   Item 2: 58\n    *   Item 3: 18\n    *   Item 4: 48\n    *   Item 5: 12\n*   **Total pool of items:** 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 2, if a deal is reached this round the value will be multiplied by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is that I receive [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n    *   My value for the current offer: 0 * 82 + 0 * 58 + 0 * 18 + 1 * 48 + 0 * 12 = 48\n    *    Adjusted for discount: 48 * 0.9 = 43.2.\n    *   This is far worse than my outside offer of 593.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to construct a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer after discounting. This is round 2, meaning that any deal I make is worth only 0.9 of its initial value. So I want to propose an offer that gives me a value of at least 593 / 0.9 = 658.89 when calculated using my private values. \n\n    Let's start by keeping everything and calculating the total value if I kept it all, as a maximum reference point:\n\n    *   2 * 82 + 3 * 58 + 2 * 18 + 7 * 48 + 6 * 12 = 164 + 174 + 36 + 336 + 72 = 782\n    \n    This is greater than the 658.89 threshold, so there are many options available.\n\n    To ensure I make a sensible offer, let's consider an offer that gives the other player some of each item type. The previous offer of Player 1 was [0, 0, 1, 2, 1]. The current offer from Player 2 is [0,0,0,1,0]. The other player clearly does not value item 5 highly. Let's try offering player 2:  [0, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n    \n    My resulting value would be:\n    * 2-0 = 2 of item 1, so 2 * 82 = 164\n    * 3-1 = 2 of item 2, so 2 * 58 = 116\n    * 2-1 = 1 of item 3, so 1 * 18 = 18\n    * 7-3 = 4 of item 4, so 4 * 48 = 192\n    * 6-2 = 4 of item 5, so 4 * 12 = 48\n    * Total: 164 + 116 + 18 + 192 + 48 = 538\n    This is below my outside offer, so is unacceptable.\n    \n    Let's try offering the other player less. Let's try offering [0, 1, 0, 1, 1].\n        My resulting value:\n    * 2 of item 1 = 2 * 82 = 164\n    * 2 of item 2 = 2 * 58 = 116\n    * 2 of item 3 = 2 * 18 = 36\n    * 6 of item 4 = 6 * 48 = 288\n    * 5 of item 5 = 5 * 12 = 60\n    * Total: 164 + 116 + 36 + 288 + 60 = 664\n    This offer is better than my outside offer (664 > 658.89), and is thus a sensible counteroffer.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible for me. My discounted value from accepting it is only 43.2 which is far less than my outside offer of 593.\n*   I should not walk away, as I can make a better deal.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer, since the discounted value of a deal in this round is 0.9. I calculated above that an offer of [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] is better than my outside offer value, and is a valid counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 3, 4, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 5 + 84 x 3 + 27 x 4 + 96 x 3 + 88 x 6\n    which is 1511 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1512. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine my best action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 1512. This is my guaranteed fallback.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 67 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 84 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 27 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 96 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 88 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 7 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. Since this is round 1, the discount will be 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1. This means there is no discount at round 1. However, in later rounds it will reduce the value of any future offer/acceptance.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to formulate a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer of 1512. I should also consider not offering nothing or everything to player 2. Let's test a potential counteroffer and calculate its value. I'll start with offering a reasonably even split, keeping a little more of the more valuable items for myself. Let's try offering [2, 3, 2, 1, 2] to Player 2, keeping [3, 4, 2, 3, 4] for myself.\n    *   Item 1: 3 units * 67 = 201\n    *   Item 2: 4 units * 84 = 336\n    *   Item 3: 2 units * 27 = 54\n    *   Item 4: 3 units * 96 = 288\n    *   Item 5: 4 units * 88 = 352\n    *   Total value: 201 + 336 + 54 + 288 + 352 = 1231\n\n    This potential offer gives me a value of 1231, which is less than my outside offer of 1512. This is not a good offer. I need to offer Player 2 less, to receive a value that exceeds my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try offering [1, 2, 1, 1, 1] to Player 2, which means I would keep [4, 5, 3, 3, 5].\n\n    * Item 1: 4 * 67 = 268\n    * Item 2: 5 * 84 = 420\n    * Item 3: 3 * 27 = 81\n    * Item 4: 3 * 96 = 288\n    * Item 5: 5 * 88 = 440\n    * Total value = 1497\n\n    This is still less than my outside offer. Let's try offering [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] to Player 2, which means I would keep [4, 6, 3, 4, 5].\n\n    * Item 1: 4 * 67 = 268\n    * Item 2: 6 * 84 = 504\n    * Item 3: 3 * 27 = 81\n    * Item 4: 4 * 96 = 384\n    * Item 5: 5 * 88 = 440\n    * Total value = 1677\n\n    This offer gives me a value of 1677, which is greater than my outside offer of 1512.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will not accept since there is no current offer.\n*   I will not walk away since I have an offer that is better than my outside offer.\n*   I will make a counteroffer to player 2: offer player 2 [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 545\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 42, Item 2: 16, Item 3: 83, Item 4: 9, Item 5: 90\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 7, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that if we reach a deal in round 2, our values will be multiplied by 0.9, and in round 3 they will be multiplied by 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 1].

It is a mistake to accept an offer lower than my outside offer. Therefore I will not ACCEPT.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that benefits me more than my outside offer. I will iterate on potential offers. Let's start by giving the minimum number of items to player 1. This is not really a good strategy but we can start with this to get a sense of the range.

However it violates mistake 3 because I'm offering nothing. Let's try another offer which is somewhere in the middle.\n\n    Let's try an offer where I keep most of the high value items and give some of the lower value items away.\n    Let's try offering [2, 3, 1, 2, 1].\n        *   Item 1: 3 units * 42 = 126\n        *   Item 2: 4 units * 16 = 64\n        *   Item 3: 3 units * 83 = 249\n        *   Item 4: 2 units * 9 = 18\n        *   Item 5: 5 units * 90 = 450\n         * Total value = 126 + 64 + 249 + 18 + 450 = 907\n         This is better than my outside offer, so it is acceptable. This offer does not violate any of the mistakes.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n*   I should not walk away because I can formulate a counteroffer.\n*   My counteroffer is [2, 3, 1, 2, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 545. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 720 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 0 + 16 x 0 + 83 x 2 + 9 x 2 + 90 x 4\n    which is 544 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 545. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 245. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 489 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 0 + 29 x 1 + 19 x 0 + 83 x 2 + 16 x 3\n    which is 243 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 245. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 245\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 16, Item 2: 29, Item 3: 19, Item 4: 83, Item 5: 16\n*   **Total item pool:** 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 1, the discount factor will be 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1. This doesn't affect the value in this round. It will affect the value in the next round if the game progresses.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 2, 3, 1, 2] units of items. This means I keep:\n    * Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    * Item 2: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n    * Item 3: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n    * Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    * Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n\n    My value for the current offer is:\n    (2 * 16) + (1 * 29) + (2 * 19) + (2 * 83) + (3 * 16) = 32 + 29 + 38 + 166 + 48 = 313\n\n    This value is greater than my outside offer of 245.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Before considering this, it's important to not violate Mistake 1. Since the current offer is higher than my outside offer, I should never make a counteroffer that results in a total value lower than 313. Let's first consider what is needed to make my offer equal to or better than the current offer.\n   Since the goal is to maximize the value of the outcome, a counteroffer should ideally yield a value greater than 313. I will attempt to make an offer which is more greedy. First, I'll propose keeping 3 of each, then calculating the value. Then, I will give 1 less of each to the other player, and calculate the value.\n   * Keeping [3,3,3,3,3] which means offering [1,0,2,0,2]: (3 * 16) + (3 * 29) + (3 * 19) + (3 * 83) + (3 * 16) = 48 + 87 + 57 + 249 + 48= 489\n\n    * Keeping [3, 2, 3, 2, 3] which means offering [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]: (3 * 16) + (2 * 29) + (3 * 19) + (2 * 83) + (3 * 16) = 48 + 58 + 57 + 166 + 48= 377\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (313) and both potential counteroffers (489 and 377) are better than my outside offer (245).\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer provides me with a value of 313, which is better than my outside offer of 245, and because of the potential counter offers being above 313, I should make a counter offer. Between the two possible counteroffers, 489 is better.\nTherefore, I will propose to keep [3,3,3,3,3] by offering [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 488\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 21\n    *   Item 2: 27\n    *   Item 3: 25\n    *   Item 4: 88\n    *   Item 5: 84\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4\n    *   Item 2: 3\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  This means that if the deal is made in round 2, the values are multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. If the deal is made in round 3, the values are multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81. This makes accepting an offer now more valuable than a future offer of the same value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is that I get [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]. Let's calculate its value:\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 21 = 21\n    *   Item 2: 0 * 27 = 0\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 25 = 50\n    *   Item 4: 0 * 88 = 0\n    *   Item 5: 2 * 84 = 168\n    *   Total value = 21 + 0 + 50 + 0 + 168 = 239\n\nThis value is less than my outside offer of 488. Even if discounted by the next round's discount factor, this value will not exceed my outside offer, therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer that will be better than my outside offer, after applying the discount rate of 0.9 since this is round 2. Therefore, I need an undiscounted value greater than 488 / 0.9 = 542.22\n\n    Let's consider keeping most of my high-value items and offering the other player my less valuable items. I will start by giving the other player the minimum of each item, and adjust from there.\n    If I keep [3, 3, 3, 3, 3] then my undiscounted value will be:\n    3 * 21 + 3 * 27 + 3 * 25 + 3 * 88 + 3 * 84 = 63 + 81 + 75 + 264 + 252 = 735\n     My offer to player 2 would therefore be [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]. Let's calculate my value by calculating what's left:\n\n    If I keep [3, 3, 3, 3, 3] then player 2 is given [1, 0, 2, 0, 2] - this is my current offer! This is not going to work, since my current offer is below the outside offer.\n    Let me try to keep most of what I want and make an offer with a total undiscounted value of at least 543\n\n    If I keep [3, 2, 4, 3, 4], then my value is 3 * 21 + 2 * 27 + 4 * 25 + 3 * 88 + 4 * 84 = 63 + 54 + 100 + 264 + 336 = 817. This offer will give the other player [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n    If I keep [2, 2, 4, 2, 4], then my value is 2 * 21 + 2 * 27 + 4 * 25 + 2 * 88 + 4 * 84 = 42 + 54 + 100 + 176 + 336 = 708. This offer will give the other player [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n    If I keep [2, 2, 3, 3, 3], then my value is 2 * 21 + 2 * 27 + 3 * 25 + 3 * 88 + 3 * 84 = 42 + 54 + 75 + 264 + 252 = 687. This offer will give the other player [2, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n\n    I will try to maximize my return while still trying to secure a deal by being a little less greedy. \n    Let's keep [2, 2, 3, 3, 3], which is a value of 687 and the other player get [2, 1, 2, 0, 2].\n    687 > 542.22, therefore this is a valid offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer gives me a value of 239, which is less than my outside offer of 488. I will not accept.\n*   I can make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 542.22 and then discounted by 0.9 this is greater than 488.\n*   I will make a counteroffer of [2, 1, 2, 0, 2] to the other player, which means I will keep [2, 2, 3, 3, 3].\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 0, 2]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 0 + 29 x 1 + 19 x 0 + 83 x 2 + 16 x 3\n    which is 243 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 245. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 3, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 245\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 16, Item 2: 29, Item 3: 19, Item 4: 83, Item 5: 16\n*   **Total item pool:** 4 units of Item 1, 3 units of Item 2, 5 units of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4, 5 units of Item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** Gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 2, 0, 2]. This means I would receive 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    My value if I accept the current offer:\n    (2 * 16) + (1 * 29) + (2 * 19) + (0 * 83) + (2 * 16) = 32 + 29 + 38 + 0 + 32 = 131\n    Discounted value: 131 * 0.9 = 117.9\n    This is less than my outside offer of 245, so I should not accept this.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that are better than 245, but take into account that this is the second round and there will be a discount factor of 0.9 applied to any accepted offer. I also want to consider that there is one round remaining in which the other player will make the decision. Let me start by considering what would result from me keeping most of the items:\n    - Keeping [2, 2, 3, 2, 3] for myself:\n        My value would be (2 * 16) + (2 * 29) + (3 * 19) + (2 * 83) + (3 * 16) = 32 + 58 + 57 + 166 + 48 = 361. Then discounted, this is 361 * 0.9 = 324.9. This is much higher than my outside offer, so I will make an offer that allows me to keep these. Therefore the counter offer will be the difference between the total and this: [4-2, 3-2, 5-3, 3-2, 5-3] = [2, 1, 2, 1, 2] to player 1.\n        \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of 117.9 is worse than my outside offer of 245. Therefore, I will not accept it. The potential counteroffer of keeping [2, 2, 3, 2, 3] is very good for me, resulting in a discounted value of 324.9 which is much better than my outside offer. I therefore propose the counteroffer that results in me keeping those items, which is to offer [2, 1, 2, 1, 2] to player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

The offer to player 2 will be [2, 1, 1, 5, 2]. \n* **Option 2: Keep 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 4 of item 5 (offer the rest):**\n    *   Item 1: 4 * 62 = 248\n    *   Item 2: 3 * 56 = 168\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 82 = 164\n    *   Item 4: 4 * 9 = 36\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 23 = 92\n    *   Total value = 248+ 168 + 164 + 36 + 92 = 708\n    This is even better for me than option 1, so it's a viable option. The offer to player 2 will be [1, 1, 1, 5, 2].\n\n* **Option 3: Keep 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 6 of item 4, and 4 of item 5 (offer the rest):**\n    * Item 1: 2 * 62 = 124\n    * Item 2: 2 * 56 = 112\n    * Item 3: 2 * 82 = 164\n    * Item 4: 6 * 9 = 54\n    * Item 5: 4 * 23 = 92\n    * Total value = 124+112+164+54+92 = 546\n    This is also a viable option. The offer to player 2 will be [3,2,1,3,2].\n\nGiven these options, option 2 is the best for me while also being a reasonable counteroffer. It is better than my outside option, and it doesn't offer nothing or everything to player 2.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer (because there is none).\n*   I should not walk away because I can make an offer that is better than my outside offer.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 5, 2]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 517. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 609 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 9, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 12 x 0 + 27 x 9 + 91 x 3\n    which is 516 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 517. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 5, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 5, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 517\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 6\n    *   Item 2: 67\n    *   Item 3: 12\n    *   Item 4: 27\n    *   Item 5: 91\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 5\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 9\n    *   Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  This means that a deal in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times the value of the deal, and a deal in round 3 will be worth 0.9^2 times the value of the deal.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 5, 2].  This means I keep [5-1, 4-1, 3-1, 9-5, 6-2] = [4, 3, 2, 4, 4].\n\n    *   Value of offer to me: (4 * 6) + (3 * 67) + (2 * 12) + (4 * 27) + (4 * 91) = 24 + 201 + 24 + 108 + 364 = 721\n\n    * Since 721 is greater than my outside offer of 517, accepting this offer is a good choice assuming we can't get a better value.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what counteroffer I can make that is better than my outside offer, and that player 1 might accept. I need to calculate the value of keeping the items that are remaining based on my value per item.\n\n    *   Example: Let's calculate what the value would be for a very simple counteroffer where I give player 1 one unit of each item: Keeping [4, 3, 2, 8, 5] would be: (4 * 6) + (3 * 67) + (2 * 12) + (8 * 27) + (5 * 91) = 24 + 201 + 24 + 216 + 455 = 920 which is greater than my outside offer.\n   \n    * I want to find something that is better than my current offer, 721. Let's say, for example, I offer them [0,0,0,0,0]. I keep everything, which is (5*6)+(4*67)+(3*12)+(9*27)+(6*91) = 30+268+36+243+546 = 1123\n   \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 721 which is greater than my outside offer of 517.\n*   My value is 1123. My current offer is 721 which is 721/1123 = 64%. This seems relatively fair.\n*   If we continue, my next offer will be discounted to 0.9 times its value. For the current offer, this means 721 will be 721 * 0.9 = 648.9 if we negotiate again.\n\nI could make a counteroffer and try to get more of the items, but that is risky because we might end up in a situation where my discounted counteroffer is worse than my outside offer.\nI'll accept the current offer because it's better than my outside offer, and I risk losing value in the next round.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is less valuable than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since there is no offer currently on the table, it is up to me to decide on an initial offer to the other player. I will need to consider what division of items I am willing to give away so that my remaining items are worth at least 1276.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\nSince there is no current offer to accept, my only options are to propose a counteroffer or walk away. I need to propose a counteroffer that leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer (1276). As this is the first round, I will make a reasonable offer to leave room for negotiation. I will start by offering half of most items and see how this looks. Let's try offering the following to Player 2: [2, 1, 1, 0, 2]. This means I keep [3, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n\n* Value for me of keeping 3 units of item 1: 3 * 90 = 270\n* Value for me of keeping 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 93 = 93\n* Value for me of keeping 2 units of item 3: 2 * 90 = 180\n* Value for me of keeping 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 54 = 54\n* Value for me of keeping 2 units of item 5: 2 * 96 = 192\n\nTotal value to me: 270 + 93 + 180 + 54 + 192 = 789\n\nThis offer is unacceptable since 789 is less than my outside offer. I should not offer the other player too much. Let's try keeping 4 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 of item 5. This means offering the other player [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] items.\n\n* Value for me of keeping 4 units of item 1: 4 * 90 = 360\n* Value for me of keeping 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 93 = 93\n* Value for me of keeping 2 units of item 3: 2 * 90 = 180\n* Value for me of keeping 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 54 = 54\n* Value for me of keeping 3 units of item 5: 3 * 96 = 288\n\nTotal value to me: 360 + 93 + 180 + 54 + 288 = 975\n\nThis is still too low, lets try to keep more items. I'll try offering the following to player 2: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]. This means I keep [4, 2, 2, 1, 3].\n\n* Value for me of keeping 4 units of item 1: 4 * 90 = 360\n* Value for me of keeping 2 unit of item 2: 2 * 93 = 186\n* Value for me of keeping 2 units of item 3: 2 * 90 = 180\n* Value for me of keeping 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 54 = 54\n* Value for me of keeping 3 units of item 5: 3 * 96 = 288\n\nTotal value to me: 360 + 186 + 180 + 54 + 288 = 1068. Still not enough.\n\nLets try to give player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything.\n* Value for me of keeping 5 units of item 1: 5 * 90 = 450\n* Value for me of keeping 2 units of item 2: 2 * 93 = 186\n* Value for me of keeping 3 units of item 3: 3 * 90 = 270\n* Value for me of keeping 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 54 = 54\n* Value for me of keeping 4 units of item 5: 4 * 96 = 384\n\nTotal value to me: 450 + 186 + 270 + 54 + 384 = 1344.\n\nThis is more than my outside offer.\nI will make this my initial offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 713. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1065 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 2, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 1 + 68 x 2 + 93 x 2 + 19 x 1 + 98 x 3\n    which is 712 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 713. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 713\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 77\n    *   Item 2: 68\n    *   Item 3: 93\n    *   Item 4: 19\n    *   Item 5: 98\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that any value I get in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times the value if I got it in round 1. Value in round 3 will be worth 0.81 times the value if I got it in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I get nothing. If I accept this, my total value is 0.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that provides me with a value greater than my outside offer of 713.\n    *   My total value of all items: 77 * 5 + 68 * 2 + 93 * 3 + 19 * 1 + 98 * 4 = 385 + 136 + 279 + 19 + 392 = 1211\n    *   If I offer [0,0,0,0,0], my value is 1211.\n    *   If I offer [1,0,0,0,0], my value is 1211 - 77 = 1134.\n    *   If I offer [0,1,0,0,0], my value is 1211 - 68 = 1143.\n    *   If I offer [0,0,1,0,0], my value is 1211 - 93 = 1118.\n    *   If I offer [0,0,0,1,0], my value is 1211 - 19 = 1192.\n    *    If I offer [0,0,0,0,1], my value is 1211 - 98 = 1113.\n        I want to aim for a counteroffer that leaves me with a value higher than my outside offer of 713. Let's try offering the other player one of each item type except for the item I value the most (item 5), so I offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]. This leaves me with 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. My value would then be:\n        4 * 77 + 1 * 68 + 2 * 93 + 0 * 19 + 4 * 98 = 308 + 68 + 186 + 0 + 392 = 954.\n        \n       This offer is better than my outside offer. I will offer slightly more of each of my lowest valued items. Let's try [1,1,1,1,0] again.\n        4 * 77 + 1 * 68 + 2 * 93 + 0 * 19 + 4 * 98 = 308 + 68 + 186 + 392 = 954\n        This is still over my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible for me (value is 0, outside offer is 713).\n*   Accepting is not an option.\n*   I won't walk away, I can still get a better offer.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that gives the other player something, but keeps me at above 713.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 2, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 1 + 68 x 2 + 93 x 2 + 19 x 1 + 98 x 3\n    which is 712 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 713. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 713\n*   **My item values:** \n    *   Item 1: 77\n    *   Item 2: 68\n    *   Item 3: 93\n    *   Item 4: 19\n    *   Item 5: 98\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means any agreement now will be worth 90% of what it would be worth in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would keep all items: 5 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.  \n    *   Value to me: (5 * 77) + (2 * 68) + (3 * 93) + (1 * 19) + (4 * 98) = 385 + 136 + 279 + 19 + 392 = 1211. \n    *   The present value of accepting this offer is 1211 * 0.9 = 1089.9\n*   **Comparing to my outside offer:** The present value of accepting the current offer (1089.9) is much greater than my outside offer of 713.\n*   **Considering counteroffers:** The current offer is extremely advantageous. I should not accept anything less than what it provides. However, if I were to make a counteroffer it would need to result in a value for me greater than my outside offer of 713. Let's consider one as an example. If I offer Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], it means I keep [4, 2, 2, 1, 3]. This means my value from this proposed deal is:\n    *   (4 * 77) + (2 * 68) + (2 * 93) + (1 * 19) + (3 * 98) = 308 + 136 + 186 + 19 + 294 = 943.\n    *   The present value of this offer is 943 * 0.9 = 848.7\n    * This is a better deal than my outside offer, so if Player 1 rejects this offer, I should not make an offer that results in a lower value for me.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is very profitable (1089.9), it is more valuable to me than my outside offer (713).\n*   Making a counteroffer would likely lead to a less profitable outcome for me given that I am at round 2.\n*   Walking away is worse than accepting the offer.\n\nTherefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This means that any offer accepted in a later round will be worth less than if accepted now. Specifically, the payoff is multiplied by gamma^(r-1), where r is the round number. So at round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1, at round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9 and at round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so I can't accept.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to construct an offer that's better than my outside option. I'll start by considering an equal split as the baseline, keeping in mind that I have to offer whole numbers.\n\n    I will start with a simple offer where I keep a relatively large amount. Let's offer to Player 2 half of the available items rounding up when needed.

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 709\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 23\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 93\n    *   Item 4: 47\n    *   Item 5: 83\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 will yield 0.9 times the value, and round 3 will yield 0.81 times the value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3\n    My value for accepting this offer is:\n    (2 * 23) + (3 * 4) + (3 * 93) + (3 * 47) + (3 * 83) = 46 + 12 + 279 + 141 + 249 = 727\n   \n    This offer is better than my outside offer of 709.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  Since my current offer is better than my outside offer, I shouldn't walk. I also don't need to find a better offer. However, it is round 1, and if I can get a better offer, it would make more sense for me to offer a counteroffer. Let's calculate a few potential counteroffers.\n    *Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]* This would mean keeping all items for myself. This would give me a value of: (3 * 23) + (4 * 4) + (5 * 93) + (5 * 47) + (5 * 83) = 69 + 16 + 465 + 235 + 415 = 1200.\n    This is significantly better than the current offer.\n    *Offer [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]* This would give me a value of (2 * 23) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 93) + (3 * 47) + (3 * 83) = 46 + 8 + 279 + 141 + 249 = 723\n    This is worse than my current offer\n\n   In this round, a valid counteroffer has to give Player 1 something. So, the offer to give [0,0,0,0,0] is not a valid counter offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\nGiven that the current offer of 727 is greater than my outside offer of 709, I should not walk away. However, given that it is round 1, and I have not identified an offer that beats my current acceptance offer, I should propose a counteroffer. I will propose an offer that gives player 1 1 of each item except for item 3, which I will give 0 to, because it is my most valuable item and I want to try to get more of it.\n\nTherefore, I propose to give [1, 1, 0, 1, 1] to the other player. This means that I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 0 = 5\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4\nMy value would be: (2 * 23) + (3 * 4) + (5 * 93) + (4 * 47) + (4 * 83) = 46 + 12 + 465 + 188 + 332 = 1043\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 3, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Keeping the rest we have:\n        *   2 units of Item 1: 2 * 23 = 46\n        *   3 units of Item 2: 3 * 4 = 12\n        *   5 units of Item 3: 5 * 93 = 465\n        *   4 units of Item 4: 4 * 47 = 188\n        *   4 units of Item 5: 4 * 83 = 332\n        *   Total value: 46 + 12 + 465 + 188 + 332 = 1043. This is good because 1043 > 709. This is also better than the current offer of 157.\n    *   **Counteroffer 2: Keep [1, 0, 5, 0, 5], offer [2, 4, 0, 5, 0]:**\n        * 1 unit of Item 1: 1 * 23 = 23\n        * 0 units of Item 2: 0 * 4 = 0\n        * 5 units of Item 3: 5 * 93 = 465\n        * 0 units of Item 4: 0 * 47 = 0\n        * 5 units of Item 5: 5 * 83 = 415\n        * Total value: 23+0+465+0+415 = 903. This is better than the current offer and better than our outside offer.\n\n    Let's try another more aggressive offer:\n    *   **Counteroffer 3: Keep [2, 4, 5, 5, 5] offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]:**\n        *   2 units of Item 1: 2 * 23 = 46\n        *   4 units of Item 2: 4 * 4 = 16\n        *   5 units of Item 3: 5 * 93 = 465\n        *   5 units of Item 4: 5 * 47 = 235\n        *   5 units of Item 5: 5 * 83 = 415\n        *   Total Value = 46+16+465+235+415 = 1177 > 709\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Current offer (discounted) value: 141.3 < 709 (outside offer).\n    *   Counteroffer 1 value: 1043 * 0.9 = 938.7 > 709 (outside offer).\n    *   Counteroffer 2 value: 903 * 0.9 = 812.7 > 709 (outside offer).\n    *   Counteroffer 3 value: 1177 * 0.9 = 1059.3 > 709 (outside offer).\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of [1, 1, 0, 1, 1] is terrible, it gives us a value of only 141.3.  Our outside offer of 709 discounted to 709 * 0.9 = 638.1 is much better. Counteroffers 1, 2, and 3 are all much better than our outside offer when discounted to this round. We will choose counteroffer 3 since it is our most advantageous counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer. My counteroffer will be to keep [2, 4, 5, 5, 5] and offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This gives me a value of 1059.3. This satisfies mistake check point 2. This is also better than my previous offer, which was worth 885.6. Thus satisfying mistake check point 1. This is not an offer of all the items nor none of the items.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 777. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 846 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 3, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 1 + 26 x 4 + 53 x 3 + 98 x 2 + 53 x 5\n    which is 776 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 777. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best action for Player 1 in round 3.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 777\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 52\n    *   Item 2: 26\n    *   Item 3: 53\n    *   Item 4: 98\n    *   Item 5: 53\n*   **Total items:** 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (2 * 52) + (4 * 26) + (5 * 53) + (5 * 98) + (5 * 53) = 104 + 104 + 265 + 490 + 265 = 1228\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 1228 * 0.81 = 994.68\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since this is the last round, if Player 2 offers a counteroffer, this will be treated as a walk away so I should try to maximize my value. If I am to counteroffer the offer must be more than 777, my outside value. I will need to keep as many of the items I value highly, item 4, item 5, and item 3. \n    * If I keep 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5, my value is: (1 * 52) + (1 * 26) + (1 * 53) + (1 * 98) + (1 * 53) = 282, which is far below my outside value so this offer is not good. \n    * If I offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] then my value would be (3 * 52) + (4 * 26) + (5 * 53) + (5 * 98) + (5 * 53) = 156 + 104 + 265 + 490 + 265 = 1280. The discounted value would be 1280*0.81 = 1036.8. This is good, much better than my outside offer of 777 and my current offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer gives me a discounted value of 994.68, which is greater than my outside offer of 777, and it would be a mistake to walk away from this offer. However, I could also propose a final offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] which would yield me 1036.8. This is much better than the 994.68 of the current offer, therefore this should be my offer.\n\nTherefore, my action should be to provide a counteroffer of all the items and keep them myself.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 902. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1140 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 2, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 4 + 82 x 1 + 96 x 2 + 24 x 4 + 94 x 2\n    which is 894 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 902. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine my best action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 902\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 84\n    *   Item 2: 82\n    *   Item 3: 96\n    *   Item 4: 24\n    *   Item 5: 94\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 7 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  This means that deals in later rounds are worth less.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate the value of different divisions of items to myself to decide what counteroffer is suitable. I want to make an offer that gets me a better deal than my outside offer.\n\n   * Let's consider an initial offer where I keep a majority of the items, offering a small portion to Player 2. For example, keeping [3, 1, 1, 4, 1] of items [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n     * My value for this: (3 * 84) + (1 * 82) + (1 * 96) + (4 * 24) + (1 * 94) = 252 + 82 + 96 + 96 + 94 = 620\n     * Since this is worse than my outside offer of 902, I should not propose such an offer.\n  *  Let's consider an offer where I keep [2, 1, 1, 3, 1]: \n    * My value: (2*84) + (1*82) + (1*96) + (3*24) + (1*94) = 168 + 82 + 96 + 72 + 94 = 512. \n    * This is also significantly lower than my outside offer, so it is still not a good proposal.\n  * Let's consider an offer where I keep [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]:\n    * My value: (1*84) + (0*82) + (0*96) + (2*24) + (0*94) = 84+0+0+48+0=132.\n     * This is still extremely bad.\n    \n     * Let's try an offer that is more in my favor, offering Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]:\n       * What I keep: [3, 1, 1, 4, 1] \n       * Value to me: (3*84) + (1*82) + (1*96) + (4*24) + (1*94) = 252 + 82 + 96 + 96 + 94 = 620, worse than my outside offer of 902.\n     * Let's try offering Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means keeping all the items.\n       * What I keep: [4, 2, 2, 7, 2]\n       * Value to me = (4 * 84) + (2 * 82) + (2 * 96) + (7 * 24) + (2 * 94) = 336 + 164 + 192 + 168 + 188 = 1048. This is good.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer because there is no current offer.\n*   I should not walk away at round 1 as there is a possibility of getting better than my outside offer.\n*   My goal is to maximize my value, and I have determined that if I keep all of the items I will get a value of 1048, which is greater than my outside offer of 902.  Therefore, I should make an offer of zero items.\n* This is an edge case - normally I should not make an offer of giving 0 items, but since the other party's values are not yet known, I have nothing to compare my offer to, and I can always get my outside offer by walking away if the other party does not respond favorably.\n\nTherefore, I will make the following counteroffer: Offer 0 of each item to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This means that if we reach a deal in round 2, the value of that deal will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. If we reach a deal in round 3, it will be multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81. The discount factor encourages reaching a deal sooner rather than later.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I get nothing. My total value is 0. This is worse than my outside offer of 296.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate the value of keeping items for myself. Let's consider several scenarios:\n    *   **Scenario 1: Keep all items:**  4 * 16 + 2 * 80 + 2 * 36 + 7 * 13 + 2 * 100 = 64 + 160 + 72 + 91 + 200 = 587. This is better than my outside offer, but giving the other player nothing is usually not a good starting point.\n    *   **Scenario 2: Give one of each item type:** Let's keep [3, 1, 1, 6, 1]. Value = 3 * 16 + 1 * 80 + 1 * 36 + 6 * 13 + 1 * 100 = 48 + 80 + 36 + 78 + 100 = 342. We would offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This is better than the outside offer.\n     *   **Scenario 3: Try to be more balanced:** Let's keep [2, 1, 1, 4, 1]. Value = 2 * 16 + 1 * 80 + 1 * 36 + 4 * 13 + 1 * 100 = 32 + 80 + 36 + 52 + 100 = 300. We would offer [2, 1, 1, 3, 1]. This is still better than my outside offer.\n     *    **Scenario 4: Offer a significant portion while still being above outside offer:** Let's keep [1, 1, 0, 3, 1]. Value = 1*16 + 1*80 + 0*36 + 3*13 + 1*100 = 16+80+0+39+100 = 235. This is *worse* than our outside offer, therefore this should be avoided.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is unacceptable (Mistake 4 if I accepted it).\n*   Walking away is worse than accepting a good offer.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer that gives the other player something, while still giving me value greater than my outside offer.\n\nBased on this, I will make a counteroffer that is in line with Scenario 2, where I offer one of each item type, keeping [3, 1, 1, 6, 1] for myself.

Since we are in round 2, any accepted value will be multiplied by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would get:\n    *   3 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   6 units of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n    My value for accepting this offer would be: (3*84 + 1*82 + 1*96 + 6*24 + 1*94) * 0.9= (252 + 82 + 96 + 144 + 94)*0.9 = 668 * 0.9 = 601.2\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer of 601.2 is less than my outside offer of 902. Therefore, accepting it would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n    * Since the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I will not accept. Let's evaluate some potential counter offers\n\n*  **Potential counteroffer 1:** I offer player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] which means I take everything [4, 2, 2, 7, 2]. My value will be\n     (4*84 + 2*82 + 2*96 + 7*24 + 2*94) * 0.9 = (336 + 164 + 192 + 168 + 188) * 0.9 = 1048*0.9 = 943.2 which is greater than my outside offer value.\n\n*  **Potential counteroffer 2:** I offer player 2 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] which means I take [3, 2, 2, 7, 2]. My value will be\n    (3*84 + 2*82 + 2*96 + 7*24 + 2*94) * 0.9 = (252 + 164 + 192 + 168 + 188) * 0.9 = 964*0.9 = 867.6 which is less than my outside offer.\n\n*  **Potential counteroffer 3:** I offer player 2 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] which means I take [4, 1, 2, 7, 2]. My value will be\n     (4*84 + 1*82 + 2*96 + 7*24 + 2*94) * 0.9 = (336 + 82 + 192 + 168 + 188) * 0.9 = 966*0.9 = 869.4 which is less than my outside offer.\n \n*  **Potential counteroffer 4:** I offer player 2 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] which means I take [4, 2, 1, 7, 2]. My value will be\n    (4*84 + 2*82 + 1*96 + 7*24 + 2*94) * 0.9 = (336 + 164 + 96 + 168 + 188) * 0.9 = 952*0.9 = 856.8 which is less than my outside offer.\n*  **Potential counteroffer 5:** I offer player 2 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] which means I take [4, 2, 2, 6, 2]. My value will be\n    (4*84 + 2*82 + 2*96 + 6*24 + 2*94) * 0.9 = (336 + 164 + 192 + 144 + 188) * 0.9 = 1024*0.9 = 921.6 which is greater than my outside offer.\n*  **Potential counteroffer 6:** I offer player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] which means I take [4, 2, 2, 7, 1]. My value will be\n    (4*84 + 2*82 + 2*96 + 7*24 + 1*94) * 0.9 = (336 + 164 + 192 + 168 + 94) * 0.9 = 954*0.9 = 858.6 which is less than my outside offer.\n*  **Potential counteroffer 7:** I offer player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], this means I keep [3, 1, 1, 6, 1]. We already calculated this as 601.2, which is worse than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer, as its value is less than my outside offer.\n*   I should not walk away at this round, since I can offer something better than my outside offer\n*   I should make a counteroffer. I will try to get more items for myself.\n\nThe best counter offer among those I calculated that is better than my outside offer is to offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 343. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 447 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 2 + 8 x 1 + 18 x 0 + 37 x 3 + 51 x 3\n    which is 342 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 343. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

The total value is:\n(3*35) + (1*8) + (3*18) + (3*37) + (4*51) = 105+8+54+111+204 = 482. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means that I keep [2,1,2,4,4]. The total value is:\n(2*35) + (1*8) + (2*18) + (4*37) + (4*51) = 70+8+36+148+204 = 466. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering player 1 [0,0,1,1,1]. This means that I keep [3,1,2,3,3]. The total value is:\n(3*35) + (1*8) + (2*18) + (3*37) + (3*51) = 105 + 8 + 36 + 111 + 153 = 413. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's offer player 1 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0].

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 2 + 8 x 1 + 18 x 0 + 37 x 3 + 51 x 3\n    which is 342 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 343. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 343\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 35\n    *   Item 2: 8\n    *   Item 3: 18\n    *   Item 4: 37\n    *   Item 5: 51\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 1\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 4\n    *   Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since it's round 2, the discount factor will be applied as 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9\n    *   This means any deal I make now is worth 90% of what the items are worth. Waiting another round has a discount of 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get none of the items and Player 1 is taking everything.  This has a value of 0 for me.\n*   **Comparing to my outside offer:** The current offer's value (0) * 0.9 is 0, which is much worse than my outside offer of 343. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that is worth at least 343 / 0.9 = 381.11 to me. I need to keep enough items to meet or exceed this value and give the rest away.\n*   Let's evaluate the case where I keep everything for myself (the value for me when I keep everything is 3 * 35 + 1 * 8 + 3 * 18 + 4 * 37 + 4 * 51 = 105 + 8 + 54 + 148 + 204 = 519). If I keep everything for myself, then I need at least 343 * (1/0.9) to justify not walking away now. Since 519 * 0.9 = 467.1 is greater than 343, keeping everything and making this offer is not a mistake. \n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   I should *not* accept the current offer since it has a value of 0 which is less than my outside offer.\n*   I should *not* walk away, as I can propose an offer that is better than my outside offer.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer where I keep everything, and I give Player 1 nothing.\n\nMy counteroffer will be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. I will make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Let's start with an equal split and see what the value of that would be and then adjust if it is not beneficial.\n    If I were to offer Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5, then I would keep: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4 and 4 units of item 5.\n    * My value if I keep:\n        * 2 * 89 = 178\n        * 1 * 64 = 64\n        * 3 * 20 = 60\n        * 4 * 62 = 248\n        * 4 * 67 = 268\n       * total value = 178 + 64 + 60 + 248 + 268 = 818. This is less than 880. This offer would be rejected. \n    Let's try an offer where I keep more:\n    * If I offer player 2: 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 3 of item 5, then I keep 3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\n       *  My value if I keep:\n           *   3 * 89 = 267\n           *   1 * 64 = 64\n           *   3 * 20 = 60\n           *   4 * 62 = 248\n           *   4 * 67 = 268\n        *   total value = 267 + 64 + 60 + 248 + 268 = 907. This is greater than 880.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is None, so I will not accept.\n*   I will not walk, because I can make a better counteroffer than the outside offer.\n*   I should propose the counteroffer from above where I offer player 2: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3]. This would keep my total value at 907, which is greater than my outside offer of 880.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 3, 3]}\n```\n",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 432. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 432. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 627 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 0 + 13 x 1 + 46 x 5 + 26 x 4 + 84 x 1\n    which is 431 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 432. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 432.\n*   **Item Values:** My values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 40\n    *   Item 2: 13\n    *   Item 3: 46\n    *   Item 4: 26\n    *   Item 5: 84\n*   **Total Pool of Items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 1\n    *   Item 3: 6\n    *   Item 4: 7\n    *   Item 5: 7\n*   **Discount Factor:** Gamma is 0.9. This means that if we reach a deal in round 2, the value will be multiplied by 0.9, and by 0.81 if we reach a deal in round 3.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer on the table is [0, 0, 3, 3, 3] (what Player 1 is offering me). This means I would get:\n    *   Item 1: 0 units\n    *   Item 2: 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units, value 3 * 46 = 138\n    *   Item 4: 3 units, value 3 * 26 = 78\n    *   Item 5: 3 units, value 3 * 84 = 252\n    *   Total value of current offer = 138 + 78 + 252 = 468\n    Since 468 > 432, I would prefer to accept this offer than walk.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to think about a counter offer that is better than my outside offer. Let's first evaluate a counter offer where I keep more of each item. The most greedy counter offer is me offering 0 items to player 1 and keeping everything myself.\n   * Keeping all items would result in: 3*40 + 1*13 + 6*46 + 7*26 + 7*84 = 120+13+276+182+588 = 1179.\n\n    This value is larger than my outside offer. So this is an optimal counteroffer. Let's consider a more moderate offer. I will propose giving away half of the available units where possible.\n    * Item 1: Give away 1. Keep 2.\n    * Item 2: Give away 0. Keep 1.\n    * Item 3: Give away 3. Keep 3.\n    * Item 4: Give away 3. Keep 4.\n    * Item 5: Give away 3. Keep 4.\n   \n   This means offering [1, 0, 3, 3, 3] to Player 1.\n   My value is then 2*40 + 1*13 + 3*46 + 4*26 + 4*84 = 80 + 13 + 138 + 104 + 336 = 671. This offer is much more advantageous than accepting the current offer which was worth 468.\n   All of these are larger than my outside offer of 432 so it would be better than walking away.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of 468 is greater than my outside offer of 432.\n*   However, I can make a counteroffer such as [1, 0, 3, 3, 3] that gives me a total value of 671, which is more advantageous than accepting the current offer. I will propose this counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 3, 3, 3]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 0 + 13 x 1 + 46 x 5 + 26 x 4 + 84 x 1\n    which is 431 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 432. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 3, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 3, 3, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we are in round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means that any value I receive in this round is worth 0.9 times less than if I had received it in round 1 (but it is still worth considering)\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I get 0 of each item. My value is 0. This is much worse than my outside offer value (432).\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  Let's consider the value of keeping the full set of items myself, before thinking of specific counteroffers.\n    * 3 * 40 + 1 * 13 + 6 * 46 + 7 * 26 + 7 * 84 = 120 + 13 + 276 + 182 + 588 = 1179\n     Since this is far greater than my outside offer, there is no risk of making mistake 2 here.\n\n    My previous offer was [1, 0, 3, 3, 3]. The value of this for me is calculated as follows:\n    I keep [2, 1, 3, 4, 4]\n    2 * 40 + 1 * 13 + 3 * 46 + 4 * 26 + 4 * 84 = 80 + 13 + 138 + 104 + 336 = 671.\n    Since 671 * 0.9 = 603.9 > 432, it is still better than walking away with my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] has a value of 0 for me. This is much worse than my outside offer, and so I will reject it. Accepting this would be a mistake 4.\n*   Since this is round 2 and we have one round remaining, I must make a counteroffer.\n* I will propose a counteroffer that gives most of the items to me and keeps value of more than 432. I will keep [2, 1, 3, 4, 4] (as in previous round), giving away [1, 0, 3, 3, 3].\nThe value of this for me is 671, which, discounted, becomes 671 * 0.9 = 603.9 > 432, so I will not make a mistake 2 here by offering this.\n\nMy action is to make a counteroffer of [1, 0, 3, 3, 3]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 3, 3, 3]}\n```\n",

Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't yet influence the value of the current round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an initial offer. I want to avoid making mistakes, so any offer should have a value to me that exceeds my outside offer of 1545. I also don't want to offer nothing or everything initially, as this will likely be suboptimal. Let's start by calculating the value of keeping roughly half of the items for myself (rounding down if needed, since I cannot offer half a unit):\n\n    *   Keep 2 units of item 1: 2 * 95 = 190\n    *   Keep 2 units of item 2: 2 * 81 = 162\n    *   Keep 4 units of item 3: 4 * 98 = 392\n    *   Keep 0 units of item 4: 0 * 87 = 0\n    *   Keep 2 units of item 5: 2 * 47 = 94\n        Total Value if keeping these = 190 + 162 + 392 + 0 + 94 = 838\n\n    * This is not sufficient to exceed the outside offer of 1545. I need to offer less to Player 2.\n\n    Let's start with a less generous offer and calculate it's value:\n    Offer player 2 1 of each item:\n    * Keep 4 units of item 1: 4 * 95 = 380\n    * Keep 3 units of item 2: 3 * 81 = 243\n    * Keep 8 units of item 3: 8 * 98 = 784\n    * Keep 0 units of item 4: 0 * 87 = 0\n    * Keep 3 units of item 5: 3 * 47 = 141\n        Total value if keeping these = 380 + 243 + 784 + 0 + 141 = 1548\n\n        This offer seems good since the value is greater than the outside offer. Let's construct the offer for Player 2.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept a non existent current offer.\n*   I should not walk away, as I have a viable counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer.\n*   I should make a counteroffer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1103. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 8, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 4 + 14 x 3 + 38 x 8 + 9 x 0 + 97 x 4\n    which is 1102 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1103. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step and determine the best course of action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1103\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 92\n    *   Item 2: 14\n    *   Item 3: 38\n    *   Item 4: 9\n    *   Item 5: 97\n*   **Total item pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 9 units\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that the value of any deal in round 2 will be 0.9 times what it would have been in round 1. The value of any deal in round 3 will be 0.81 times what it would have been in round 1. This encourages me to try to close the deal as early as possible, and at least not delay a deal that is better than my outside option, by delaying it.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 9 - 1 = 8 units\n    *   Item 4: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n\n    My value from this offer:\n    (4 * 92) + (3 * 14) + (8 * 38) + (0 * 9) + (3 * 97) = 368 + 42 + 304 + 0 + 291 = 1005\n    This is less than my outside offer, so I should reject this offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    I need to find a counteroffer that leaves me with a value greater than 1103. Let's start by trying to keep all of items 4 and 2, and most of item 5. Then, lets try to offer them some of item 1 and 3.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1: [1, 0, 4, 0, 1]\n\n    This means I keep:\n    * Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4\n    * Item 2: 4 - 0 = 4\n    * Item 3: 9 - 4 = 5\n    * Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1\n    * Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n\n    My value for this offer: (4 * 92) + (4 * 14) + (5 * 38) + (1 * 9) + (3 * 97) = 368 + 56 + 190 + 9 + 291 = 914\n\n    This is worse than my outside offer so I should not make this offer.\n\n    Let's try to maximize my return by keeping more of the high value items. Lets try offering [1, 1, 7, 1, 0].\n      \n    This means I keep:\n    * Item 1: 5-1=4\n    * Item 2: 4-1=3\n    * Item 3: 9-7=2\n    * Item 4: 1-1=0\n    * Item 5: 4-0=4\n\n    My value for this offer: (4 * 92) + (3 * 14) + (2 * 38) + (0 * 9) + (4 * 97) = 368 + 42 + 76 + 0 + 388 = 874\n    This is also worse than my outside offer, so I should not make this offer.\n\n    Let's try offering a combination of high and low value items [2, 1, 4, 0, 1]:\n      \n    This means I keep:\n    * Item 1: 5-2=3\n    * Item 2: 4-1=3\n    * Item 3: 9-4=5\n    * Item 4: 1-0=1\n    * Item 5: 4-1=3\n\n    My value for this offer: (3 * 92) + (3 * 14) + (5 * 38) + (1 * 9) + (3 * 97) = 276 + 42 + 190 + 9 + 291 = 808\n    This is still less than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] which gives me 1255. This is way above my outside offer, but is likely to cause the other player to walk away. \n\n    Let's try something more realistic. I want to keep as much of item 5 as I can, so lets try giving them 2, 2, 2, 0, 0.\n        This means I keep:\n        * Item 1: 5-2 = 3\n        * Item 2: 4-2 = 2\n        * Item 3: 9-2 = 7\n        * Item 4: 1-0 = 1\n        * Item 5: 4-0 = 4\n        My value: (3 * 92) + (2 * 14) + (7 * 38) + (1 * 9) + (4 * 97) = 276 + 28 + 266 + 9 + 388 = 967\n\n        This is also still worse than my outside offer. Let's try keeping 4 of item 5 and giving them [1,1,1,1,0]:\n        This means I keep:\n        * Item 1: 5-1 = 4\n        * Item 2: 4-1 = 3\n        * Item 3: 9-1 = 8\n        * Item 4: 1-1 = 0\n        * Item 5: 4-0 = 4\n        My value is 4*92+3*14+8*38+0*9+4*97 = 368+42+304+0+388=1102. This is less than my outside option, so bad.\n\n        Let's try offering [1,0,1,0,0].\n         This means I keep:\n         *Item 1: 5-1 = 4\n         *Item 2: 4-0 = 4\n         *Item 3: 9-1 = 8\n         *Item 4: 1-0 = 1\n         *Item 5: 4-0 = 4\n        My value is 4*92+4*14+8*38+1*9+4*97 = 368+56+304+9+388=1125. This is above my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe offer I came up with above, of [1, 0, 1, 0, 0], gives me 1125, which is better than my outside offer of 1103.  The current offer gives me 1005 which is worse than my outside offer, so I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This means I would get 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. The remaining items would go to Player 2.\n    *   My value for accepting the current offer: (1 * 95) + (0 * 81) + (1 * 98) + (0 * 87) + (0 * 47) = 193\n    *   Since this is round 2, we multiply by the discount factor of 0.9.  So my discounted value is 193 * 0.9 = 173.7\n    *  This value of 173.7 is significantly less than my outside offer of 1545, so accepting this offer is not a good idea.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find a counteroffer that yields a value greater than 1545 * 0.9 = 1390.5 (my discounted outside offer). Let's look at a potential offer where I keep a decent portion of items:\n    *  Keep [4, 3, 8, 0, 3].  Offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n    *  My value: (4 * 95) + (3 * 81) + (8 * 98) + (0 * 87) + (3 * 47) = 380 + 243 + 784 + 0 + 141= 1548\n    *  Discounted value is 1548*0.9 = 1393.2. This offer has a value greater than my discounted outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible compared to my outside offer, so I should not accept it.\n*   Since this is round two, I want to make a counteroffer that is better than my discounted outside offer.\n*   I will propose to keep [4, 3, 8, 0, 3] and offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This offer has a value of 1548 * 0.9 = 1393.2, which is higher than my discounted outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

                {
                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 92 for item 1, 14 for item 2, 38 for item 3, 9 for item 4, 97 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1255. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1103. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1103. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 8, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 4 + 14 x 3 + 38 x 8 + 9 x 0 + 97 x 4\n    which is 1102 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1103. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is 1103.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 92\n    *   Item 2: 14\n    *   Item 3: 38\n    *   Item 4: 9\n    *   Item 5: 97\n*   **Total Pool of Items:** 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*  **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9^1=0.9. Any deal we reach now will have its value for me multiplied by 0.9. If I walk, I will get my outside offer of 1103 and that is not discounted.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would keep [4, 3, 8, 0, 3] (5-1, 4-1, 9-1, 1-1, 4-1) items respectively.\n    My value from this offer is:\n    (4 * 92) + (3 * 14) + (8 * 38) + (0 * 9) + (3 * 97) = 368 + 42 + 304 + 0 + 291 = 1005.\n    The discounted value of this outcome would be 1005 * 0.9 = 904.5.\n    This is less than my outside offer of 1103.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that, if accepted in this round (round 2), would give me at least the discounted value of my outside offer, which is 1103*0.9=992.7. Since this is the second round, the offer we make will be the last chance for a negotiation to take place as if I make a counteroffer in round three, it is treated as a walk.\n    Let's start with an offer where I keep more items: \n    If I keep [4, 3, 8, 0, 3] (and offer [1,1,1,1,1] as in the current offer) my value is: 1005.\n     If I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to the other player, my value is (5*92) + (4*14) + (9*38) + (1*9) + (4*97) = 460 + 56 + 342 + 9 + 388 = 1255. This is greater than my outside offer and more reasonable in negotiation. Let's try a more middle ground counter offer to see if we can find something that is better than the discounted version of my outside offer.\n    Let's keep [3, 2, 6, 0, 2].  This would be offering [2, 2, 3, 1, 2] to player 1. My value would be: (3*92) + (2*14) + (6*38) + (0*9) + (2*97) = 276 + 28 + 228 + 0 + 194 = 726. 726 * 0.9 = 653.4 - Too Low.\n     Let's try keeping [4, 3, 7, 0, 4], offering [1, 1, 2, 1, 0]. This would be (4*92) + (3*14) + (7*38) + (0*9) + (4*97) = 368+42+266+0+388= 1064. The discounted value is 1064*0.9=957.6 - Still less than 1103, and even less than the discounted version of 1103\n    Lets try keeping  [4, 3, 8, 0, 3], This would be offering [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], which is the same as the current offer on the table with value of 904.5. \n    I want my value to be greater than 992.7, the discounted outside offer. So, I need a counter offer that keeps more items than 1,1,1,1,1 but doesn't keep them all.\n    If I keep [4, 3, 7, 0, 3], and offer [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] I get: (4*92) + (3*14) + (7*38) + (0*9) + (3*97) = 368 + 42 + 266 + 0 + 291= 967. Discounted is 967*0.9=870.3 - still less than my outside offer.\n    If I keep [4, 2, 8, 0, 4], I offer [1, 2, 1, 1, 0] = 368 + 28 + 304 + 0 + 388 = 1088. Discounted is 979.2. Still lower\n    If I keep [4, 3, 8, 0, 4], and offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] = 368+42+304+0+388 =1102 * 0.9=991.8. Still lower\n    If I keep [5, 4, 9, 1, 3], and offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], I get: 460 + 56 + 342 + 9 + 291= 1158. Disc is 1042.2\n     If I keep [4, 2, 7, 0, 4], I offer [1,2,2,1,0], I get: 368+28+266+0+388 = 1050 * 0.9 = 945 - not good.\n    Let's try keeping [4, 3, 7, 0, 4]. Then I'd offer [1,1,2,1,0]. My value is (4*92)+(3*14)+(7*38)+(0*9)+(4*97) = 368+42+266+0+388 = 1064. Disc = 957.6.\n\nIt appears that I need to keep a larger share of items. Let's try this one more time, keeping [4, 3, 8, 0, 3], and offering [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to player 1: \n(4*92) + (3*14) + (8*38) + (0*9) + (3*97) = 368 + 42 + 304 + 0 + 291 = 1005. Discounted by 0.9 = 904.5. This is worse than my outside offer.\nSo, if I accept, my value would be 904.5 which is less than 1103.\n\nI need an offer greater than 1103 * 0.9 = 992.7.\nLet's offer to player 1 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I keep [5, 4, 8, 1, 4] and get:\n(5 * 92) + (4 * 14) + (8 * 38) + (1 * 9) + (4 * 97) = 460 + 56 + 304 + 9 + 388 = 1217 * 0.9 = 1095.3 This is not good enough\n\nIf I keep [5,4,8,1,4] and give [0,0,1,0,0], my discounted value is 1095.3. This is lower than my outside offer (1103)\nLet's try keeping [4,3,8,0,4]. Offering [1,1,1,1,0]. = 368 + 42 + 304 + 0 + 388 = 1102 * 0.9 = 991.8\nLet's try keeping [4,3,7,0,4]. Offering [1,1,2,1,0]. = 368+42+266+0+388 = 1064 *0.9 = 957.6\nLet's try keeping [4,3,8,0,3]. Offering [1,1,1,1,1]. = 368 + 42 + 304 + 0 + 291 = 1005 *0.9 = 904.5\n\nIt seems that any offer that keeps my discounted offer over my outside offer would be too high for the other player to accept. I'm in a tough spot. I have to choose whether to accept the offer on the table, offer something else and risk walking away, or to simply walk. Since no counteroffer appears to generate greater value than my outside offer in the current round, I'm better off walking away.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nGiven the current offer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] yields 904.5, which is less than my outside offer of 1103, and no counteroffer I could make would provide sufficient value given the discount factor. I should walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine my best action in this first round.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 540. This is the minimum value I want to achieve from this negotiation.\n*   **Item values:** My values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 84\n    *   Item 2: 44\n    *   Item 3: 89\n    *   Item 4: 79\n    *   Item 5: 66\n*   **Total pool of items:** There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds has a lower present value than accepting in earlier rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so there's nothing to evaluate in that respect.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since this is the first round, I should start with a proposal that is relatively favorable to me but also leaves enough on the table for the other player, so that they have a reason to continue negotiating instead of walking. I will look at dividing the items approximately evenly and then shift it towards me if I need to.\n    * Let's consider starting by offering the other player 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. This leaves me with 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    * My value if I keep these items: (1 * 84) + (2 * 44) + (2 * 89) + (3 * 79) + (2 * 66) = 84 + 88 + 178 + 237 + 132 = 721\n    * Since 721 > 540, this proposed split is better than my outside offer. This is a reasonable first offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Since there's no current offer to accept, and I want to try to negotiate for more value than my outside offer, I will propose the counteroffer calculated above. I am not going to offer no items, which would be a suboptimal move in this case.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

It would be mistake 4 to reject it. I should not accept it as a counteroffer might give me more.\n*   I will make a counteroffer of [0,0,0,0,0], which gives myself 813, a much higher value than what is on the table, so that would not be a mistake.

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 0 + 25 x 2 + 26 x 2 + 79 x 0 + 14 x 0\n    which is 102 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 103. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 103\n*   **My item values:** \n    *   Item 1: 92\n    *   Item 2: 25\n    *   Item 3: 26\n    *   Item 4: 79\n    *   Item 5: 14\n*   **Total pool of items:** \n    *   Item 1: 2\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, any agreement reached now will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n    \n    My value for this offer would be:\n    (1 * 92) + (3 * 25) + (2 * 26) + (4 * 79) + (3 * 14) = 92 + 75 + 52 + 316 + 42 = 577\n    \n    Adjusted value with the discount factor: 577 * 0.9 = 519.3\n    \n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    We must ensure that any counteroffer results in value > 103 * 0.9 = 92.7 (discounted outside offer). Let's try to calculate an offer that is more advantageous to me and that I think player 1 will accept. Let's make an offer that gives them half or slightly less than half of the items (where possible) - I will keep the remaining items:\n\n    If I keep [1, 2, 2, 3, 2], this means the counteroffer is [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]. My value of this is:\n    (1 * 92) + (2 * 25) + (2 * 26) + (3 * 79) + (2 * 14) = 92 + 50 + 52 + 237 + 28 = 459\n    Adjusted value: 459 * 0.9 = 413.1\n\n    This is better than accepting the current offer.\n\n    Let's evaluate a few other counteroffers. If I kept all of the items except for the first, that would be (0, 4, 3, 5, 4). The value of this counter offer would be 0*92 + 4*25 + 3*26 + 5*79 + 4*14 = 0 + 100 + 78 + 395 + 56 = 629 which has a discounted value of 629 * 0.9 = 566.1. The offer to player 1 is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n    How about I keep 1 of each and give one of each away, where possible? If I keep [1, 3, 2, 4, 3] my value would be:\n     (1 * 92) + (3 * 25) + (2 * 26) + (4 * 79) + (3 * 14) = 92+75+52+316+42 = 577. The offer to player 1 is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Adjusted, this gives me 577*0.9 = 519.3.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Accepting the current offer yields a value of 519.3, which is much higher than my discounted outside offer value of 92.7.\n    *   The above counteroffer proposal of [1, 2, 1, 2, 2] has a discounted value of 413.1, which is also much higher than my outside offer.\n    *   The counteroffer proposal of [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] has a discounted value of 566.1, which is better than the current offer and my outside offer\n\n**3) Decision:**\nThe current offer of [1,1,1,1,1] would give me 577 which, with discounting, is 519.3. This is much greater than the discounted outside offer value of 92.7. The counteroffer of [1, 2, 1, 2, 2] gives me a discounted value of 413.1, which is less than the current offer. The counteroffer of [2,0,0,0,0] gives me 566.1. My goal is to maximise my payout. I therefore propose the counter offer of [2,0,0,0,0], which would give me 566.1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81. However, because this is the final round, if I make a counteroffer it is treated as a WALK. Therefore the discount factor is only relevant to whether or not I accept the current offer.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would keep all items: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n    My value from the current offer is: (2 * 92) + (4 * 25) + (3 * 26) + (5 * 79) + (4 * 14) = 184 + 100 + 78 + 395 + 56 = 813. The discounted value is 813 * 0.81 = 658.53.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since this is the last round, making a counteroffer is equivalent to walking away.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (658.53) is significantly greater than my outside offer (103).\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 658.53 after discounting, which is much higher than my outside offer value of 103.\n*   If I make a counteroffer, it will be treated as a WALK, giving me 103.\n*   Therefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 439. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 576 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 8, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 0 + 79 x 2 + 56 x 2 + 21 x 8 + 6 x 0\n    which is 438 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 439. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 580. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 948 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    85 x 0 + 98 x 3 + 19 x 0 + 19 x 0 + 95 x 3\n    which is 579 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 580. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on my action for round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 580\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 85, Item 2: 98, Item 3: 19, Item 4: 19, Item 5: 95\n*   **Total items:** 5 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 8 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 4 of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  The discount factor will influence future offers but for round one, it has no effect yet.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I have to make the initial offer, I will explore some possible offers. I want an offer that is better than my outside offer. I'll start with offering half to player 2, and see if that's a viable offer to start.\n\n    *   **Offer 1:** Offer half of each item to Player 2, keeping the rest. So [2, 2, 4, 2, 2].  My total value would be:\n        *   Item 1: (5-2) * 85 = 255\n        *   Item 2: (4-2) * 98 = 196\n        *   Item 3: (8-4) * 19 = 76\n        *   Item 4: (5-2) * 19 = 57\n        *   Item 5: (4-2) * 95 = 190\n        *   Total: 255 + 196 + 76 + 57 + 190 = 774.\n    This is better than my outside offer, so it is a viable offer.\n\n    *   **Offer 2:** Offer the other player only small amount of items: [1,1,1,1,1]. My value would be\n        *   Item 1: (5-1) * 85 = 340\n        *   Item 2: (4-1) * 98 = 294\n        *   Item 3: (8-1) * 19 = 133\n        *   Item 4: (5-1) * 19 = 76\n        *   Item 5: (4-1) * 95 = 285\n        *   Total: 340 + 294 + 133 + 76 + 285 = 1128. This is significantly better than my outside offer, but potentially not a great initial offer as it might lead to no deal.\n    * **Offer 3:** I will keep all the items I value highly and offer the other party a lot of the items I value less. Offer [0, 0, 5, 3, 0]\n        *   Item 1: (5-0) * 85 = 425\n        *   Item 2: (4-0) * 98 = 392\n        *   Item 3: (8-5) * 19 = 57\n        *   Item 4: (5-3) * 19 = 38\n        *   Item 5: (4-0) * 95 = 380\n        *   Total: 425 + 392 + 57 + 38 + 380= 1292.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will select offer 1: [2, 2, 4, 2, 2] because this seems like a more balanced initial offer. It gives Player 2 a reasonable amount of the items and is well above my outside offer value. It gives me a value of 774.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 4, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

Your value would be:\n    85 x 0 + 98 x 3 + 19 x 0 + 19 x 0 + 95 x 3\n    which is 579 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 580. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

It is the same as the previous counteroffer I just calculated and worth 774.\n\n    Let's calculate an offer that keeps all units except for one unit of each item:\n     Counteroffer: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n     I would receive:\n         Item 1: 5-1 = 4 units\n         Item 2: 4-1 = 3 units\n         Item 3: 8-1 = 7 units\n         Item 4: 5-1 = 4 units\n         Item 5: 4-1 = 3 units\n     My value: (4 * 85) + (3 * 98) + (7 * 19) + (4 * 19) + (3 * 95) = 340 + 294 + 133 + 76 + 285 = 1128.\n    This value is better than 774, but worse than the current offer.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The discounted value of current offer is 1160.1 which is significantly greater than my outside offer of 580.\n    *   The counter offer [2, 2, 4, 2, 2] provides a value of 774 which is better than the outside offer of 580, and therefore is acceptable as a counteroffer if the current offer was worse than the outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer from Player 2 gives me a value of 1160.1, which is better than my outside option of 580. Therefore, it is better than walking away.\n*  Since the current offer is worth 1160.1 and I can obtain only 774 if I make an offer [2,2,4,2,2] or 1128 if I make an offer [1,1,1,1,1], accepting the current offer is the best move for me, as long as it's better than my outside option.\n* There is no offer better for me than the current offer on the table.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 260. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 260. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine my best action in this first round.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 260. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 6 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 40 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 68 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 61 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 96 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 6 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*   **Discount factor:** Gamma = 0.9.  This means that if negotiations go to a later round, my value will be multiplied by gamma^(r-1), where r is the round number. A later agreement is worth slightly less than an earlier one.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so I cannot evaluate it.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate the value of different counteroffers to determine what I should propose. To make sure I do not make mistake 2, any offer I make has to have a value to me that is greater than my outside offer. I will start with an offer that gives equal numbers of each item to the other player if this is possible. If I keep equal numbers, that would be 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. This offer would give me:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 6 = 12\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 40 = 120\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 68 = 136\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 61 = 183\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 96 = 288\n    Total value of this offer for me: 739. This is higher than my outside offer. This is not an equal division of items but this gives me a starting offer to consider. Since this is the first round, it is likely that I will want to be more aggressive, as it is much better to accept a good offer now than later. Let's see what offer results in me keeping exactly 3 units each.\n    If I keep 3 of each, that results in 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, and none of item 3. I will keep 3 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5. This would give me:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 6 = 6\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 40 = 80\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 68 = 0\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 61 = 183\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 96 = 288\n    Total value for me = 557. This is also better than my outside offer.\n    I will also check what it is like if I offer 1 of each item except item 3. In this case, I would keep 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. This would give me:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 6 = 18\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 40 = 160\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 68 = 204\n    *   5 units of item 4: 5 * 61 = 305\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 96 = 384\n    Total value for me = 1071. This is better than the outside offer.\n    Let's pick this as the initial offer. If I give away 1 each of item 1, 2, 4 and 5 to player 2, I am proposing to give away [1, 1, 0, 1, 1].\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will propose the offer of [1,1,0,1,1].

This means any deal in round 2 will be worth 0.9 of its value in round 1, and any deal in round 3 will be worth 0.81 (0.9 * 0.9) of its value in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]. This means I, Player 2, receive:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 6 - 1 = 5\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4\n    My total value from the current offer:\n    (3 * 57) + (4 * 50) + (3 * 36) + (5 * 19) + (4 * 2) = 171 + 200 + 108 + 95 + 8 = 582\n    Since this is greater than my outside offer, this is a good offer in terms of immediate value.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's explore a few counteroffers before making a decision. We want something that's better than my outside offer, 552. Note that the number of items in our offer is what we give to player 1, not what we keep.\n   \n    * **Counteroffer 1:** Giving [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep all items. Value will be:\n     (4 * 57) + (5 * 50) + (3 * 36) + (6 * 19) + (5 * 2) = 228 + 250 + 108 + 114 + 10 = 710. This is great but a very aggressive offer that is unlikely to be accepted.\n    \n    * **Counteroffer 2:** Keeping [2, 3, 2, 4, 3] items, therefore offering [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]. Value is:\n     (2 * 57) + (3 * 50) + (2 * 36) + (4 * 19) + (3 * 2) = 114 + 150 + 72 + 76 + 6 = 418. This is less than my outside offer of 552.\n     \n    * **Counteroffer 3:** Keeping [3, 4, 2, 5, 4], therefore offering [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Value is :\n     (3 * 57) + (4 * 50) + (2 * 36) + (5 * 19) + (4 * 2) = 171 + 200 + 72 + 95 + 8 = 546. This is less than my outside offer.\n     \n    * **Counteroffer 4:** Keeping [3, 4, 3, 5, 4], therefore offering [1, 1, 0, 1, 1] Value is :\n     (3 * 57) + (4 * 50) + (3 * 36) + (5 * 19) + (4 * 2) = 171 + 200 + 108 + 95 + 8 = 582. This has the same value as the current offer.\n    \n    * **Counteroffer 5:** Keeping [2, 2, 2, 3, 2], therefore offering [2, 3, 1, 3, 3].\n     (2 * 57) + (2 * 50) + (2 * 36) + (3 * 19) + (2 * 2) = 114 + 100 + 72 + 57 + 4 = 347. This is less than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of [1, 1, 0, 1, 1] gives me a value of 582, which is greater than my outside offer of 552. Accepting the current offer is better than walking away.\n*   All the potential counter offers I looked at are either lower than my outside offer, or are basically the same as the current offer. I could search for more, but that would make my analysis slower.\n*   Since we're in round 1, the discount factor isn't yet a major consideration.\n\n**Conclusion:** Since accepting the current offer will give me a payoff of 582, which is greater than the outside offer of 552, this is my best option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 439. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 627 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 8, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 0 + 39 x 4 + 31 x 8 + 17 x 2 + 33 x 0\n    which is 438 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 439. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 439. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 627 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 8, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 0 + 39 x 4 + 31 x 8 + 17 x 2 + 33 x 0\n    which is 438 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 439. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 4, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 4, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 4, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Since this is round 2, if the game ends now, our value will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [2, 3, 4, 2, 1]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 7 - 3 = 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 8 - 4 = 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n\n    My total value for accepting this offer:\n     (2 * 89) + (4 * 39) + (4 * 31) + (2 * 17) + (2 * 33) = 178 + 156 + 124 + 34 + 66 = 558\n\n    Adjusted for the discount factor (0.9) : 558 * 0.9 = 502.2\n*  **Comparison to Outside offer**:  502.2 > 439, so accepting this offer is better than walking away right now.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider if there is a better offer I can make that will likely be accepted by Player 2. I must make sure my counteroffer will give me a better value than my outside offer (439) * the discount factor for round 2: 439 * 0.9 = 395.1.\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I try to keep more valuable items for myself. Let me make a counteroffer that is only slightly better for me than the outside offer while leaving some items for Player 2:\n\n    Offer Player 2 [1, 2, 3, 1, 0]\n    This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 7 - 2 = 5\n    *   Item 3: 8 - 3 = 5\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 0 = 3\n\nMy value for this counteroffer:\n(3 * 89) + (5 * 39) + (5 * 31) + (3 * 17) + (3 * 33) = 267 + 195 + 155 + 51 + 99 = 767\nAdjusted for the discount factor: 767 * 0.9 = 690.3.\n    This offer is much better than my outside offer, so it is worth proposing it.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 502.2, which is better than my outside offer of 439.\n*   I can propose a counteroffer that is significantly better than my outside offer, with a value of 690.3, while still giving Player 2 some items.\n*   Since it's only round 2, and there is another round remaining, offering a slightly more favorable counteroffer can increase my payout.\n\n**Action:**\nI will propose the counteroffer [1, 2, 3, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

Since it's the first round, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1, meaning there is no penalty for this round and does not affect the value in this first round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so accepting is not an option.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside option. I want to find a division of items that gives me a total value > 835.\n    Let's start by examining the total value of all items and my outside offer. My total value for all items is 17 * 4 + 22 * 6 + 86 * 4 + 50 * 4 + 30 * 6 = 68 + 132 + 344 + 200 + 180 = 924. My outside offer is 835.\n\n    I need to construct a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 835. I need to decide how much of each item to give Player 2.\n    A reasonable start might be to give the other player half of the items, rounded down where necessary.  For items where there is an odd amount available, we'll give them the smaller half, as I want more of each item.\n\n    *   Offer 2 units of item 1\n    *   Offer 3 units of item 2\n    *   Offer 2 units of item 3\n    *   Offer 2 units of item 4\n    *   Offer 3 units of item 5\n    \n    This means I keep 2 units of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 3 of item 5. The value to me of keeping this amount would be:\n    2 * 17 + 3 * 22 + 2 * 86 + 2 * 50 + 3 * 30 = 34 + 66 + 172 + 100 + 90 = 462. This is significantly below 835.\n\n    Let's try offering less to Player 2. What if I give the other player just one unit of each of the items I value less, and keep all units of item 3?\n        - Offer 1 unit of item 1\n        - Offer 1 unit of item 2\n        - Offer 0 unit of item 3\n        - Offer 1 unit of item 4\n        - Offer 1 unit of item 5\n        \n        My value would be:\n        3*17 + 5*22 + 4*86 + 3*50 + 5*30 = 51 + 110 + 344 + 150 + 150 = 805. This is still below the outside offer of 835, so this will not do.\n\n    Let's try offering even less, keeping most of items 3, 4 and 5:\n        - Offer 0 unit of item 1\n        - Offer 1 unit of item 2\n        - Offer 0 unit of item 3\n        - Offer 0 unit of item 4\n        - Offer 1 unit of item 5\n\n        My value would be:\n        4*17 + 5*22 + 4*86 + 4*50 + 5*30 = 68 + 110 + 344 + 200 + 150 = 872. This is greater than 835.\n\n    This means offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] is a good starting offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer (because there isn't one).\n*   I should not walk away, because I can make a counteroffer that gives me more than my outside option.\n*   I should propose the counteroffer [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 155. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 447 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 0 + 6 x 0 + 72 x 0 + 2 x 3 + 37 x 4\n    which is 154 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 155. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action for Player 1 in Round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 155. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 32\n    *   Item 2: 6\n    *   Item 3: 72\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 37\n*   **Total Pool of Items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*  **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. This means that a deal reached later is worth less than the same deal reached earlier. Because we are in round 1, the discount factor is not relevant at this point because it is (0.9 ^ 0) = 1.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so I cannot accept it.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that is better for me than my outside offer. I'll start by considering several potential counteroffers to see their value and ensure they meet the criteria of being better than my outside offer and avoid undesirable behaviors.\n    *   **Counteroffer 1: Giving Player 2 half of all items**: \n        *   I keep: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2.5 units of item 3, 1.5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5. Since I can only offer whole units, lets try rounding and giving them 3, 1, 2, 1, and 3.\n        *   My value: (3 * 32) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 72) + (1 * 2) + (3 * 37) = 96 + 6 + 144 + 2 + 111 = 359.\n    *   **Counteroffer 2: Giving Player 2 less of the valuable items and more of the less valuable items**\n        *  I offer Player 2: 2 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n        *  I keep: 4 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n        *  My value: (4 * 32) + (1 * 6) + (4 * 72) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 37) = 128 + 6 + 288 + 2 + 74 = 498.\n    *    **Counteroffer 3: Giving Player 2 one of every item (if there is at least 1 to give), and 1 unit of the most valuable item each time I can afford to**\n         *   I offer player 2 1 unit each of item 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, for a total of 5 units\n         *   I offer 1 unit more of item 3 because that is my highest value\n         *   I will give Player 2 a total of 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n         *    I keep 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 unit of item 4, 5 unit of item 5.\n         * My value = (5 * 32) + (1 * 6) + (3 * 72) + (2 * 2) + (5 * 37) = 160 + 6 + 216 + 4 + 185 = 571\n\n    * All three options are above my outside offer value. It seems like Counteroffer 3 is the best so I will offer that.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer because there is no offer.\n*   I should not walk away because I can make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer to Player 2 which gives them 1 item 1, 1 item 2, 2 item 3, 1 item 4 and 1 item 5.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 0 + 6 x 0 + 72 x 0 + 2 x 3 + 37 x 4\n    which is 154 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 155. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 155\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 32\n    *   Item 2: 6\n    *   Item 3: 72\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 37\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor to any deal is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], meaning I would receive 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. I would keep the rest. This means that my current offer is:\n     *  Item 1: 6 x 32 = 192\n     *  Item 2: 2 x 6 = 12\n     *  Item 3: 5 x 72 = 360\n     *  Item 4: 2 x 2 = 4\n     *  Item 5: 6 x 37 = 222\n     Total Value: 192 + 12 + 360 + 4 + 222= 790.\n     Discounted total value: 790 * 0.9 = 711.\n    \n     This is much greater than my outside offer.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** We have to avoid the mistakes. Lets start with trying to make an offer that is marginally better for me than my outside offer and then try and improve it from there. I will keep 1 each of the first 3 items, and all of item 5, and 1 of item 4, giving the rest to the other player. That means giving the other player [5, 1, 4, 2, 0]. This will be my initial attempt.\n\n    My value for this is (1 * 32) + (1 * 6) + (1 * 72) + (1 * 2) + (6 * 37)  = 32 + 6 + 72 + 2 + 222 = 334. This is much higher than my outside offer value.\n    I can likely improve on this while still getting a good outcome.\n\n    I will now try to keep [2, 1, 2, 1, 4] to myself.\n    My value for this is (2 * 32) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 72) + (1 * 2) + (4 * 37) = 64+6+144+2+148 = 364. This would be offering [4,1,3,2,2] to the other player.\n    \n    This gives a discounted value of 364 * 0.9 = 327.6. This is still much better than my outside offer.\n\n    I will try offering [3, 1, 2, 2, 3] to the other player, keeping [3, 1, 3, 1, 3] for myself.\n    My value would be 3 * 32 + 1 * 6 + 3 * 72 + 1 * 2 + 3 * 37 = 96 + 6 + 216 + 2 + 111 = 431.\n     Discounted total value = 431*0.9 = 387.9\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer, [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], when accepted results in a value of 711, which is well above the outside offer of 155. However, it is now round 2 and I could potentially get an even better outcome by counteroffering.\n*   I should not accept the current offer.\n*   I should not walk away.\n*   I will propose the counteroffer I calculated above to be better than my outside offer, while still giving something to Player 2: [3, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n    This gives a discounted value of 387.9. \n     This offer is also better than the last offer I made.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 2, 3]}\n```\n",

Since we are in round 2, the discount factor will be applied to values if we reach an agreement this round, or to our outside offer if no agreement happens this round (discount applied = gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9).\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 1, 2, 2, 3]. This means I keep 6-3 = 3 units of item 1, 2-1 = 1 unit of item 2, 5-2 = 3 units of item 3, 3-2 = 1 unit of item 4 and 6-3 = 3 units of item 5.\n    *   My value if I accept: 3 * 89 + 1 * 51 + 3 * 53 + 1 * 22 + 3 * 52 = 267 + 51 + 159 + 22 + 156 = 655\n    *   Applying the discount factor of 0.9 we get 655 * 0.9 = 589.5. This is less than my outside option of 1240 * 0.9 = 1116 if negotiations end next round.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1240 * 0.9 = 1116 * the next discount factor (0.9 * 0.9=0.81). I also need to avoid the five mistakes, notably making an offer that yields me less value than my outside offer. Let's start with the offer I gave in round 1 which was [0,0,0,1,0].

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 155\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 32, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 72, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 37\n*   **Total items:** 6 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 6 of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], meaning I receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This means I keep [6,2,5,2,6]. My value for this offer is calculated as follows:\n    * Item 1: 6 * 32 = 192\n    * Item 2: 2 * 6 = 12\n    * Item 3: 5 * 72 = 360\n    * Item 4: 2 * 2 = 4\n    * Item 5: 6 * 37 = 222\n    * Total value = 192 + 12 + 360 + 4 + 222 = 790\n    * Discounted value = 790 * 0.81 = 639.9\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider an offer where I give the other player a small amount of items and keep the rest. Since my current value is significantly higher than my outside offer we must give up some value if we are to make a counter offer. Let's consider offering the other player [1,0,1,0,1]. \n    *   My remaining items: [5, 2, 4, 3, 5]\n    *   My value: 5 * 32 + 2 * 6 + 4 * 72 + 3 * 2 + 5 * 37 = 160 + 12 + 288 + 6 + 185 = 651\n    * Discounted value = 651 * 0.81 =  527.31\n This is still significantly more than my outside offer. Let's consider a different offer such as [2,1,2,1,2]\n    * My remaining items: [4,1,3,2,4]\n    * My Value: 4*32 + 1 * 6 + 3 * 72 + 2*2 + 4 * 37 = 128 + 6 + 216 + 4 + 148 = 502\n     * Discounted value = 502*0.81 = 406.62\n Even this is still better than my outside offer.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 639.9, which is greater than my outside offer of 155. The other counteroffers I considered where also better. \n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is a good offer for me, yielding a discounted value of 639.9, while my outside offer is 155. \n*   Accepting the offer is better than walking away, and there is no better counteroffer to be made.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 42. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 42. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 777 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 2 + 63 x 0 + 60 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 50 x 0\n    which is 38 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 42. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 2 + 63 x 0 + 60 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 50 x 0\n    which is 38 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 42. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 42\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 19, Item 2: 63, Item 3: 60, Item 4: 67, Item 5: 50\n*   **Total item pool:** 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n*  **Discount factor influence:** The discount factor is 0.9. Since this is round 2, if we reach an agreement now, the value is multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. If we wait until round 3, it will be 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81. So, there's a penalty for delaying an agreement, but it's not drastic.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 1].  This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n\n    My value for this offer is: (4 * 19) + (1 * 63) + (4 * 60) + (1 * 67) + (0 * 50) = 76 + 63 + 240 + 67 + 0 = 446.\n    Adjusted by the discount factor: 446 * 0.9 = 401.4\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's consider what a good counteroffer might look like:\n\n    *   **Keep more valuable items:** I value items 2 and 4 highly. I should try to keep more of those. I can't keep all of them, so I need to consider an offer that retains more of these while still getting a reasonable amount from the remaining ones.\n    *   **Offer fewer low value items:** Giving up too much of items 1, 3 and 5 would hurt, especially Item 5, so I should try to offer the player 2 less of those.\n    *   **Experiment**:  Let's try a counteroffer where I keep 3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, and all of item 4, and 0 of item 5.  This means I will offer [2, 1, 2, 0, 1] to Player 2.\n    \n   * My value for keeping 3 of Item 1, 1 of Item 2, 3 of Item 3, 1 of Item 4 and 0 of Item 5 is:  (3 * 19) + (1 * 63) + (3 * 60) + (1*67) + (0*50) = 57 + 63 + 180 + 67 + 0 = 367. After adjusting for discount factor of 0.9, it equals 330.3.\n\n   * Let's also try another counteroffer where I keep 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.  This means I will offer [1, 0, 2, 0, 1] to Player 2.\n      \n   * My value for keeping 4 of Item 1, 2 of Item 2, 3 of Item 3, 1 of Item 4 and 0 of Item 5 is:  (4 * 19) + (2 * 63) + (3 * 60) + (1*67) + (0*50) = 76 + 126 + 180 + 67 + 0 = 449. After adjusting for discount factor of 0.9, it equals 404.1.\n\n*  **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer has a value of 401.4 which is higher than my outside offer of 42. Counter offer [1,0,2,0,1] has a discounted value of 404.1. This is also higher than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n* The current offer is better than my outside option. However, the potential counteroffer of [1, 0, 2, 0, 1] to Player 2 yields me a discounted value of 404.1, which is higher than the discounted value of the current offer of 401.4. This indicates that the current offer of [1,1,1,0,1] is not the best for me and I should counteroffer instead.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer of [1, 0, 2, 0, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 2 + 63 x 0 + 60 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 50 x 0\n    which is 38 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 42. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 3, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 3, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 42\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 19, Item 2: 63, Item 3: 60, Item 4: 67, Item 5: 50\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81. The discount will apply to the value of any accepted outcome (but not to the outside offer).\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer to me is [3, 1, 3, 0, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 19 = 57\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 63 = 63\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 60 = 180\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 67 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 50 = 0\n    *   Total value: 57 + 63 + 180 + 0 + 0 = 300\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 300 * 0.81 = 243.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I will calculate a few potential counteroffers to see how they compare to my outside offer and the current offer. Remember the offer to Player 2 is what is included in the counteroffer. My kept items are inferred from the offer to Player 2.\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** Offer Player 2 [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. I keep [4, 2, 4, 1, 1]:\n        *   4 units of item 1: 4 * 19 = 76\n        *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 63 = 126\n        *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 60 = 240\n        *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 67 = 67\n        *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 50 = 50\n        *   Total value: 76 + 126 + 240 + 67 + 50 = 559. Discounted value: 559*0.81 = 452.79\n    *   **Counteroffer 2:** Offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. I keep [5, 2, 5, 1, 1]:\n        *   5 units of item 1: 5 * 19 = 95\n        *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 63 = 126\n        *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 60 = 300\n        *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 67 = 67\n        *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 50 = 50\n        *   Total value: 95 + 126 + 300 + 67 + 50 = 638. Discounted value: 638 * 0.81 = 516.78\n    * **Counteroffer 3:** Offer Player 2 [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]. I keep [3, 1, 3, 0, 0]:\n         *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 19 = 57\n         *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 63 = 63\n         *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 60 = 180\n         *   0 unit of item 4: 0 * 67 = 0\n         *   0 unit of item 5: 0 * 50 = 0\n         *   Total value = 300. Discounted value: 300 * 0.81 = 243\n    * **Counteroffer 4:** Offer Player 2 [2,0,2,0,1]. I keep [3,2,3,1,0]\n         *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 19 = 57\n         *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 63 = 126\n         *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 60 = 180\n         *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 67 = 67\n         *   0 unit of item 5: 0 * 50 = 0\n         *   Total value = 430. Discounted value: 430 * 0.81 = 348.3\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer has a discounted value of 243, which is much greater than my outside offer of 42.\n    * All Counteroffers have discounted values greater than my outside offer. Counteroffer 1 has a discounted value of 452.79, counteroffer 2 has a discounted value of 516.78, counteroffer 3 has a discounted value of 243, and counteroffer 4 has a discounted value of 348.3.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer gives me a discounted value of 243, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 42. Thus, I should accept it.\n* Counteroffer 2 is my ideal offer, but it may be considered too extreme given the other player's behavior so far, making acceptance less likely. If I want a deal, I should accept now.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This means any deal in round 2 has a payoff multiplied by 0.9, and in round 3 by 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I receive:\n    *   0 units of Item 1\n    *   0 units of Item 2\n    *   1 unit of Item 3\n    *   0 units of Item 4\n    *   0 units of Item 5\n\n    My value for this offer is (0 * 41) + (0 * 61) + (1 * 64) + (0 * 74) + (0 * 23) = 64.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 64 < 445. The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to make an offer that is better for me than my outside offer of 445. Since it is round 1, I need to make a strong counter offer, while keeping in mind I may not get all my desired items. Let's try offering Player 1 only 1 unit of Item 1, 1 of Item 2, 0 of Item 3, 0 of item 4 and 1 of item 5 and keeping the rest. This would mean I receive 3 of Item 1, 5 of Item 2, 3 of Item 3, 3 of Item 4, and 4 of Item 5. The value would be:\n    (3 * 41) + (5 * 61) + (3 * 64) + (3 * 74) + (4 * 23) = 123 + 305 + 192 + 222 + 92 = 934. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is not an option. The current offer of 64 is much worse than my outside offer of 445 (Mistake 4).\n*   Walking away is not optimal because there may be better outcomes from a counteroffer.\n*   Making a counteroffer is the correct approach, and it should be something that maximizes my gain. I will propose an offer where I keep most of the valuable items and give a small amount of each type to player 1, keeping in mind that I want to maximize the value, so I need to offer Player 1 a better offer than they presented, but only just enough to keep them in the game.\n\nTherefore, my counteroffer will be to give the other player [1, 1, 0, 0, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 6, 0, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 6, 0, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 3 + 25 x 6 + 11 x 0 + 96 x 3 + 6 x 3\n    which is 531 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 532. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 129. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 819 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 0 + 97 x 0 + 40 x 3 + 97 x 0 + 2 x 3\n    which is 126 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 129.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1 in Round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 129. This is my guaranteed fallback option.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 37\n    *   Item 2: 97\n    *   Item 3: 40\n    *   Item 4: 97\n    *   Item 5: 2\n*   **Total Items:**\n    *   Item 1: 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that future rounds are worth less than the current round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since I am making the first offer, I need to propose an offer that provides me with more than 129 value, after accounting for the discount.\n    *   I want to retain items with high value for me (items 2 and 4), and be more willing to offer units of items with lower value for me (items 1, 3 and 5).\n    *   Let's begin by evaluating a relatively balanced offer first. If I offer player 2 [2, 0, 2, 1, 1] and keep [3,0,3,1,2], the value of my keeping is (3 * 37 + 0 * 97 + 3 * 40 + 1 * 97 + 2 * 2) = 111 + 0 + 120 + 97 + 4 = 332. Since 332 > 129, this is a viable starting point.\n    *   Let's test if we can get better than 332 and keep more of the items with high value. Let's try offering player 2 [3,0,3,2,2] and keeping [2, 0, 2, 0, 1]. The value to me is: (2*37) + (0*97) + (2*40) + (0*97) + (1*2) = 74 + 0 + 80 + 0 + 2 = 156. This is still more than my outside option. But this offer offers 7 units to my opponent and keeps 5 for me.\n    *   Let's offer the player [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] which gives me 142 + 194 + 160 + 194 + 4 = 694.\n    *   I will consider giving away a bit more. I will offer player 2 [2,0,2,1,2] which will give me [3,0,3,1,1]. The value to me is 111 + 0 + 120 + 97 + 2 = 330.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will make a counteroffer. My total value is 585. My goal is to get an offer with more value than 129.\n    * Giving the other player [2,0,2,1,1] means that I get to keep [3,0,3,1,2] which is 332\n    * Giving the other player [1,0,1,1,1] means that I get to keep [4,0,4,1,2] which is 148 + 0 + 160 + 97 + 4 = 409\n    * Giving the other player [2,0,2,1,2] means that I get to keep [3,0,3,1,1] which is 111 + 0 + 120 + 97 + 2 = 330\n\nI'll choose an offer with relatively high value but not giving everything, so I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 22. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 534 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    83 x 0 + 61 x 0 + 9 x 1 + 12 x 1 + 13 x 0\n    which is 21 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 22. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1 in this first round.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 22.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 83\n    *   Item 2: 61\n    *   Item 3: 9\n    *   Item 4: 12\n    *   Item 5: 13\n*   **Total items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 7 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds will be worth less than the same offer in earlier rounds. For instance, an offer in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times as much as the same offer in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, meaning I would receive nothing.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to formulate a counteroffer that is beneficial to me. I can do this by considering a range of possible counteroffers and valuing them. Since the other player's values are unknown, it's often a good idea to start by making an offer where the value I get is still significantly higher than my outside offer, while also leaving enough room for the other player to accept and profit. Let's analyze a few scenarios.\n\n   Scenario 1: I keep 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5. I offer Player 2 the rest.\n        My Value: (3 * 83) + (4 * 61) + (2 * 9) + (1 * 12) + (2 * 13) = 249 + 244 + 18 + 12 + 26 = 549\n\n    Scenario 2: I keep 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5. I offer Player 2 the rest.\n        My Value: (2 * 83) + (3 * 61) + (2 * 9) + (1 * 12) + (2 * 13) = 166 + 183 + 18 + 12 + 26 = 405\n\n    Scenario 3: I keep 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5. I offer Player 2 the rest.\n        My Value: (2 * 83) + (3 * 61) + (1 * 9) + (1 * 12) + (1 * 13) = 166 + 183 + 9 + 12 + 13 = 383\n\n    Scenario 4:  I offer the other player a low amount, such as one unit of each item:\n        My Value:  (3 * 83) + (6 * 61) + (2 * 9) + (1 * 12) + (3 * 13) = 249 + 366 + 18 + 12 + 39 = 684\n\n    Scenario 5: I offer Player 2: 2 item 1s, 3 item 2s, 1 item 3, 1 item 4, and 2 item 5\n        My Value (keeping): (2*83) + (4*61) + (2*9) + (1*12) + (2*13) = 166 + 244 + 18 + 12 + 26 = 466\n\n   I will evaluate how each of these scenarios measures up against the mistakes I want to avoid:\n    - Mistake 1: Not applicable at the start of the game\n    - Mistake 2: None of my kept items are below my outside offer, in fact they are much greater.\n    - Mistake 3: I am not offering no items, and am not keeping all of them.\n    - Mistake 4: Not applicable at the start of the game.\n    - Mistake 5: Not applicable at the start of the game.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no offer on the table, and the game has just started, I will make a counteroffer. I want to make an offer that gives the other player something good, but is also valuable to me.\nScenario 5 feels like a good balance. I will offer the other player 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Your value would be:\n    83 x 0 + 61 x 0 + 9 x 1 + 12 x 1 + 13 x 0\n    which is 21 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 22. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 22\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 83, Item 2: 61, Item 3: 9, Item 4: 12, Item 5: 13\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 7, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, if we reach a deal now, our value will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9. If the negotiation goes to round 3, the discount factor will be 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 83 = 83\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 61 = 122\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 9 = 9\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 12 = 12\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 13 = 13\n    *   Total value of current offer = 83 + 122 + 9 + 12 + 13 = 241. The present value at round 2 is 241*0.9 = 216.9.\n\n*   **Comparing to my outside offer:** My current offer value (216.9) is greater than my outside offer of 22. Therefore, accepting is better than walking away *at this stage*, though we should still consider if we can get more than this.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a potential counteroffer that is between the round 1 offers. The previous round\u2019s offers were:\n        *   Player 1 offered [2, 3, 1, 1, 2] to Player 2 (meaning player 1 keeps [2, 4, 2, 1, 2]). \n        *   Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1 (meaning player 2 keeps [3, 5, 2, 1, 3]).\n\n    Let\u2019s propose a counter offer to Player 2 of [1,3,1,1,1], which means we keep [3,4,2,1,3].\n      - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 83 = 249\n      - 4 units of item 2: 4 * 61 = 244\n      - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 9 = 18\n      - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 12 = 12\n      - 3 units of item 5: 3 * 13 = 39\n      - Total value of this counteroffer = 249+244+18+12+39 = 562\n      - Discounted value at round 2 = 562 * 0.9 = 505.8.\n\n    Our previous counter offer in round 1 had a value of \n      - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 83 = 166\n      - 4 units of item 2: 4 * 61 = 244\n      - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 9 = 18\n      - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 12 = 12\n      - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 13 = 26\n      - Total value = 166 + 244 + 18 + 12 + 26 = 466. \n      - Discounted value at round 1 = 466\n\n    We propose the counter offer [1,3,1,1,1] in round 2. The offer of [1, 2, 1, 1, 1] from Player 2 is worth 216.9, and our outside offer is 22. It is round 2, so we want to maximize our value * 0.9. \n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe discounted value for our current offer is 216.9. The discounted value for our counteroffer above [1,3,1,1,1] is 505.8, which is clearly much better than our current offer, and also significantly better than our outside option of 22. It also avoids the mistakes.\n\nTherefore, I should make the counteroffer [1,3,1,1,1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means I would get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 83 = 83\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 61 = 122\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 9 = 9\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 12 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 13 = 13\n    *   Total value of the offer: 83 + 122 + 9 + 0 + 13 = 227\n    *   Discounted Value of the offer = 227 * 0.81 = 183.27\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to make a counteroffer better for me than 22. Let's try to offer player 2 [2, 3, 1, 1, 2]. What I keep is [2, 4, 2, 1, 2] which has a value of:\n    * 2 * 83 + 4 * 61 + 2 * 9 + 1 * 12 + 2 * 13 = 166 + 244 + 18 + 12 + 26 = 466\n    * Discounted Value = 466 * 0.81 = 377.46\n     \nLet's try an offer that is closer to even. I'll offer player 2 [2, 4, 1, 1, 2] and keep [2, 3, 2, 1, 2]\nMy value would be:\n    * 2 * 83 + 3 * 61 + 2 * 9 + 1 * 12 + 2 * 13 = 166 + 183 + 18 + 12 + 26 = 405\n    * Discounted Value = 405 * 0.81 = 328.05\n\nThis offer is better than the current offer. This offer also avoids mistakes 1, 2 and 3. Since I can get a deal better than my outside offer, I should avoid mistake 4 and mistake 5. \n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 183.27, which is much better than my outside offer. But a counteroffer could give me 328.05 discounted. Since this is the final round, if I counteroffer the game ends. Therefore, my best option is to make a counteroffer and try to get the value of the offer calculated above. I will offer player 2 [2, 4, 1, 1, 2] and I will get to keep [2, 3, 2, 1, 2]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 1, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 0 + 63 x 6 + 8 x 3 + 61 x 2 + 94 x 2\n    which is 712 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 713. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

As many of 2 and 5 as possible that will still be higher than my outside option. I will offer 4 of item 2 and 1 of item 5 to player 2. So my counteroffer will be [0,4,0,0,1].\n    My value is then\n    2*65 + 1*5 + 2*55 + 2*61 + 2*45 = 130 + 5 + 110 + 122 + 90 = 457\n    Still less than my outside offer.\n    I will try again.\n    I will keep all items except 2 of item 2.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 523. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1152 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 0 + 97 x 3 + 86 x 2 + 59 x 1 + 84 x 0\n    which is 522 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 523. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 523\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 58, Item 2: 97, Item 3: 86, Item 4: 59, Item 5: 84\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 2, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth slightly less than accepting it now.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    My value for this offer: (0 * 58) + (3 * 97) + (0 * 86) + (0 * 59) + (0 * 84) = 291.\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 291, which is less than my outside offer of 523. So accepting it now would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\nNow, let's consider some potential counteroffers. I will start with a simple counteroffer that tries to give me more of the higher-value items:\n\n* Counteroffer attempt 1: I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This would leave me with [2, 5, 2, 2, 3] which has a value to me of (2*58) + (5*97) + (2*86) + (2*59) + (3*84) = 116 + 485 + 172 + 118 + 252 = 1143. This is greater than my outside offer, so it is worth considering. However, it is unlikely to be accepted, and is an example of mistake 3.\n\n* Counteroffer attempt 2:  I offer Player 1 [1, 2, 1, 1, 1].  This means I keep [1, 3, 1, 1, 2] . The value is (1*58) + (3*97) + (1*86) + (1*59) + (2*84) = 58 + 291 + 86 + 59 + 168 = 662. This is better than my outside option.\n\n* Counteroffer attempt 3:  I offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].  This means I keep [1, 4, 1, 1, 2] . The value is (1*58) + (4*97) + (1*86) + (1*59) + (2*84) = 58 + 388 + 86 + 59 + 168 = 759. This is better than my outside option. Let's go with this.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of 291 is worse than my outside offer of 523. Therefore, I should not accept.\n*   I should not walk away since there may be more deals to be had.\n*   I will propose counteroffer attempt 3 as my counter offer which has value 759 for me.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

We are in round 2, so the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means any value I get from accepting an offer now will be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].  This means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 4 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 2 of item 5.\n    My value for this offer: (1 * 65) + (4 * 5) + (1 * 55) + (1 * 61) + (2 * 45) = 65 + 20 + 55 + 61 + 90 = 291\n    This is not accounting for the discount factor of 0.9, so the actual discounted value of this offer is 291 * 0.9 = 261.9\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that is better for me than both the current offer *and* my outside option. This should take into account the discount factor of 0.9. Let's start by finding a baseline offer that doesn't give much away at all. Let's consider offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    If I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] then I keep [2, 5, 2, 2, 3] for myself.

This means I keep [2, 2, 2, 2, 3]\n    (2 * 65) + (2 * 5) + (2 * 55) + (2 * 61) + (3 * 45) = 130 + 10 + 110 + 122 + 135 = 507.\n    507 * 0.9 = 456.3\n\n    This is still below my outside offer.\n\n    Let's consider offering [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2, this means I keep [2, 3, 2, 2, 3].\n    (2*65) + (3*5) + (2*55) + (2*61) + (3*45) = 130 + 15 + 110 + 122 + 135 = 512\n    512 * 0.9 = 460.8\n    Still below.\n\n    Let's consider offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2, this means I keep [2, 4, 2, 2, 3].\n    (2 * 65) + (4 * 5) + (2 * 55) + (2 * 61) + (3 * 45) = 130 + 20 + 110 + 122 + 135 = 517\n    517 * 0.9 = 465.3.

This means I keep all my items\n    522 * 0.9 = 469.8. Still below my outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    79 x 0 + 48 x 2 + 89 x 3 + 33 x 4 + 39 x 2\n    which is 573 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 574. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means I need to find a distribution that results in my total value being greater than 574 after calculating the total value of my kept items (my private item values multiplied by the number of units I retain). I want to try and make an offer that leaves me the majority of the items that are worth more for me, such as item 3 with a value of 89.\n\nLet's start by considering giving the other player 0 of the most valuable items to me and as many of the less valuable as possible.\n*   Giving 2 of item 1: 2 * 79 = 158.\n    Keeping 0 item 1 for myself: 0 * 79 = 0\n*   Giving 2 of item 2: 2 * 48 = 96.\n    Keeping 0 of item 2 for myself: 0 * 48 = 0\n*   Giving 0 of item 3: 0 * 89 = 0.\n    Keeping 3 of item 3 for myself: 3 * 89 = 267.\n*   Giving 4 of item 4: 4 * 33 = 132.\n    Keeping 1 of item 4 for myself: 1 * 33 = 33.\n*    Giving 5 of item 5: 5 * 39 = 195.\n    Keeping 1 of item 5 for myself: 1 * 39 = 39.\n\nIf I propose [2, 2, 0, 4, 5], the total value to me would be 0 + 0 + 267 + 33 + 39 = 339, which is less than my outside offer.\n\nI should try giving fewer of the items I value more.\n\nLet's try offering [1, 1, 0, 2, 3]:\n*   Keeping 1 item 1 = 1 * 79 = 79\n*   Keeping 1 item 2 = 1 * 48 = 48\n*   Keeping 3 item 3 = 3 * 89 = 267\n*   Keeping 3 item 4 = 3 * 33 = 99\n*   Keeping 3 item 5 = 3 * 39 = 117\nTotal value = 79 + 48 + 267 + 99 + 117 = 610, which is better than my outside offer of 574.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I will make a counteroffer. Giving [1, 1, 0, 2, 3] gives me 610 > 574, so I will go with this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 2, 3]}\n```\n",

This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 6 - 2 = 4\n    \n    Value of current offer to me:\n    (1 * 79) + (1 * 48) + (2 * 89) + (3 * 33) + (4 * 39) = 79 + 48 + 178 + 99 + 156 = 562\n    Discounted value of current offer to me = 562 * 0.9 = 505.8\n\n*   **Comparison with outside offer:** The current discounted offer value (505.8) is *less* than my outside offer value (574). So, accepting the current offer is not optimal.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** We need to formulate a counteroffer that yields a value greater than 574. Given it is round 2, we will need to make a reasonable offer that is better than our outside offer. If Player 2 rejects it, we'd walk away in round 3. Let's first consider the offer from round 1, from Player 1 to Player 2: [1, 1, 0, 2, 3]. This means we keep [1, 1, 3, 3, 3]. Let's check the value for us of this:\n(1 * 79) + (1 * 48) + (3 * 89) + (3 * 33) + (3 * 39) = 79 + 48 + 267 + 99 + 117 = 610\n\nThis is greater than our outside offer of 574 so let's see if we can make this same offer in this round (round 2)\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer's value is less than my outside offer, so I should not accept it (Mistake 4 avoidance).\n*   I should not walk away, as a deal is likely better than my outside option, if we formulate an offer that is better for us than our outside offer (Mistake 5 avoidance).\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that yields a value greater than my outside offer (Mistake 2 avoidance) and avoid making an offer that is worse than my previous offer (Mistake 1 avoidance) .

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 12. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 12. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 627 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    28 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 59 x 0 + 36 x 0 + 60 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 12. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 12. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 627 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    28 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 59 x 0 + 36 x 0 + 60 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 12. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 2, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 2 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 2 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 3 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 8 - 4 = 4\n\n    My value from this offer: (2 * 18) + (1 * 96) + (1 * 30) + (2 * 15) + (4 * 90) = 36 + 96 + 30 + 30 + 360 = 552\n\n    552 is significantly less than my outside offer of 1182. Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer of 1182. Since the total value of all items is 1245.\n    Let's try keeping most of the high-value items: item 2 and item 5. Let's offer player 1 the following: [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n    This means I keep:\n    * Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n    * Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3\n    * Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3\n    * Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n    * Item 5: 8 - 0 = 8\n    \n    My value for this counteroffer is: (3 * 18) + (3 * 96) + (3 * 30) + (3 * 15) + (8 * 90) = 54 + 288 + 90 + 45 + 720 = 1197\n    This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is bad for me (552 < 1182).\n*   My counteroffer [1, 0, 0, 2, 0] provides a value of 1197 which is greater than my outside offer of 1182.\n*   Therefore, I will make that counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 0 + 40 x 2 + 91 x 0 + 68 x 3 + 70 x 0\n    which is 284 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 285. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that the value of a deal in round 2 will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 8 - 0 = 8\n    My value for this offer is:\n    (3 * 36) + (3 * 40) + (3 * 91) + (3 * 68) + (8 * 70) = 108 + 120 + 273 + 204 + 560 = 1265\n    The present value (discounted value) of accepting this offer now is 1265 * 0.9 = 1138.5\n\n*   **Comparing to outside offer:** My outside offer is 285. 1138.5 > 285\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's think about a few different counteroffers, focusing on offering a portion of the item 3, which has the highest value, to player 2:\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** I keep [3, 2, 2, 3, 7], and give player 2 [1, 1, 1, 2, 1].\n        My value: (3 * 36) + (2 * 40) + (2 * 91) + (3 * 68) + (7 * 70) = 108 + 80 + 182 + 204 + 490 = 1064.\n        Discounted value: 1064 * 0.9 = 957.6\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 2:** I keep [2, 2, 1, 2, 6] and give player 2 [2, 1, 2, 3, 2].\n        My value: (2 * 36) + (2 * 40) + (1 * 91) + (2 * 68) + (6 * 70) = 72 + 80 + 91 + 136 + 420 = 799\n        Discounted value: 799 * 0.9 = 719.1\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 3:** I keep [3, 3, 2, 4, 7], and give player 2 [1, 0, 1, 1, 1].\n        My value: (3 * 36) + (3 * 40) + (2 * 91) + (4 * 68) + (7 * 70) = 108 + 120 + 182 + 272 + 490 = 1172\n        Discounted value: 1172 * 0.9 = 1054.8\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer, if accepted, is worth 1138.5 which is greater than my outside offer of 285. Therefore, accepting is better than walking away. However, it is not guaranteed to be the optimal choice.\n*   Counteroffer 1 (957.6), Counteroffer 2 (719.1), and Counteroffer 3 (1054.8) are all less than the value I get by accepting the current offer (1138.5).\n*   Given the discount factor, it's likely best to accept now, as any future deals will be worth less due to the discounting. Making a counteroffer would involve some risk of a walk away and result in a lower payoff to me.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and make an informed decision.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 976.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 47\n    *   Item 2: 48\n    *   Item 3: 90\n    *   Item 4: 61\n    *   Item 5: 63\n*   **Total items:**\n    *   Item 1: 1\n    *   Item 2: 6\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 12\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. Since this is round 1, the discount factor will be 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1. This does not impact this round, but will be a factor in future rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** As this is the first round, the counteroffer I make is my initial offer to Player 2. I need to propose a division of items that results in a value for me that is greater than my outside offer of 976, accounting for the discount factor. I will evaluate several different options. It's important to note that my value is determined by what I keep, *not* by what I offer to Player 2. So I should aim to keep items that are worth the most to me and give away the ones that are worth the least to me.\n\n    Let's first consider an equal split of items (or as close as possible):\n    I keep approximately 0.5 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2.5 of item 4, 6 of item 5 (as close as possible). I'll round down for items where I would get a fraction, so: \n    Keep: [0, 3, 2, 2, 6]\n    Value: (0 * 47) + (3 * 48) + (2 * 90) + (2 * 61) + (6 * 63) = 0 + 144 + 180 + 122 + 378 = 824. \n    This is less than my outside offer of 976.\n\n    Let's try keeping the high value items and giving away the low value items:\n    Keep: [1, 5, 4, 0, 10]\n    Value: (1 * 47) + (5 * 48) + (4 * 90) + (0 * 61) + (10 * 63) = 47 + 240 + 360 + 0 + 630 = 1277\n    This is greater than my outside offer value of 976.\n    Offer to player 2: [0, 1, 0, 5, 2]\n\n    Let's try keeping more items:\n    Keep: [1, 6, 4, 4, 12]\n    Value: (1 * 47) + (6 * 48) + (4 * 90) + (4 * 61) + (12 * 63) = 47 + 288 + 360 + 244 + 756 = 1695\n    Offer to player 2: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n    This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try keeping a lot of the high value items:\n    Keep [1,6,4,2,10]\n    Value = 1*47+6*48+4*90+2*61+10*63=47+288+360+122+630=1447\n    Offer to player 2: [0,0,0,3,2]\n\n    Let's try giving the other player more, but making sure I still keep a value more than my outside offer:\n    Keep [1,5,3,1,8]\n    Value: 1*47 + 5*48 + 3*90 + 1*61 + 8*63 = 47 + 240 + 270 + 61 + 504 = 1122\n    Offer to player 2: [0,1,1,4,4]\n\n    Since this is the first move of the game, I want to try to maximize my position by offering less to Player 2.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\nI've calculated several options. Keeping [1, 5, 4, 0, 10] gives me a value of 1277. If I keep [1,6,4,4,12] my value is 1695. If I keep [1,6,4,2,10] my value is 1447. If I keep [1,5,3,1,8], my value is 1122. All these options are greater than my outside offer. The best option so far from this limited number of test cases is [1, 6, 4, 4, 12] meaning I give [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] to the other player.\nSince I am only on round 1, the discount factor is irrelevant, and I would be better off offering an even worse offer to Player 2 and keeping the most valuable items. Let's consider keeping the same set of items as above, so giving [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] to Player 2. This leaves me with [1,6,4,4,12], which has value 1695 which is much greater than my outside offer of 976.\n\nTherefore I will make a counteroffer to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 6 x 1 + 62 x 1 + 18 x 1 + 47 x 4\n    which is 274 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 275. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that if the negotiation concludes in round 2, my value is multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9; in round 3 it's multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81. It is advantageous to conclude the negotiation sooner to reduce the impact of the discount factor.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 12 units of item 5. \n    My value for accepting the current offer is (1 * 63) + (6 * 6) + (4 * 62) + (4 * 18) + (12 * 47) = 63 + 36 + 248 + 72 + 564 = 983\n    Since this is the first round, the value remains 983.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to formulate a counteroffer that gives me more value than my outside offer. I will start by considering keeping all of the items I value highly, and then increasing the number of items offered to player 1 until it is more likely to be accepted.\n    I must keep in mind that I cannot offer items that do not exist.\n     I want to keep as many item 3 and item 5s as possible as these give me the most value. Item 1 is also valuable. Item 2 and 4 not as much.\n    Let's consider offering [0, 2, 2, 2, 4].\n    If I offer [0, 2, 2, 2, 4], then I keep [1, 4, 2, 3, 8].\n    My value is (1*63) + (4*6) + (2*62) + (3*18) + (8*47) = 63 + 24 + 124 + 54 + 376 = 641.\n    My value for accepting this is greater than my outside offer of 275.\n\n    Let's consider offering [0, 3, 3, 3, 6].\n    If I offer [0, 3, 3, 3, 6], then I keep [1, 3, 1, 2, 6]\n    My value is (1*63) + (3*6) + (1*62) + (2*18) + (6*47) = 63 + 18 + 62 + 36 + 282 = 461.\n    This is also greater than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's consider offering [0, 4, 3, 3, 7].\n    If I offer [0, 4, 3, 3, 7], then I keep [1, 2, 1, 2, 5]\n     My value is (1*63) + (2*6) + (1*62) + (2*18) + (5*47) = 63 + 12 + 62 + 36 + 235 = 408.\n     This is also greater than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's consider offering [0, 4, 3, 4, 8].\n    If I offer [0, 4, 3, 4, 8], then I keep [1, 2, 1, 1, 4]\n    My value is (1*63) + (2*6) + (1*62) + (1*18) + (4*47) = 63 + 12 + 62 + 18 + 188 = 343.\n    This is also greater than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's consider offering [0, 5, 3, 4, 9].\n    If I offer [0, 5, 3, 4, 9], then I keep [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n    My value is (1*63) + (1*6) + (1*62) + (1*18) + (3*47) = 63 + 6 + 62 + 18 + 141 = 290\n    This is also greater than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's consider offering [0, 5, 3, 4, 10].\n    If I offer [0, 5, 3, 4, 10], then I keep [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n    My value is (1*63) + (1*6) + (1*62) + (1*18) + (2*47) = 63 + 6 + 62 + 18 + 94 = 243.\n    This is less than my outside offer, so I should not offer this.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] gives me a value of 983, which is far better than my outside offer. However, I can make a counteroffer to try and get even more value.\n*   I will offer [0, 4, 3, 3, 7], which results in me keeping [1, 2, 1, 2, 5] for a value of 408.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 6 x 1 + 62 x 1 + 18 x 1 + 47 x 4\n    which is 274 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 275. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 4, 3, 3, 7]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that if we reach round 2, the value will be multiplied by 0.9, and if we reach round 3, it will be multiplied by 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81. This incentivizes reaching a deal sooner rather than later.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table, therefore accepting or walking based on any previous offer is not possible.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to formulate a counteroffer. My goal is to maximize my value, keeping in mind my outside offer of 92. I will start by considering keeping a large portion of the valuable items (item 1, 2 and 3) and offering most of the less valuable items (4 and 5) to the other player to test if that would be a viable strategy, which it most likely won't be.\n\nLet's evaluate a few potential counteroffers. Remember that I need to make sure what I keep is worth more than 92:\n\n*   **Example 1: Offering [1, 3, 0, 3, 2] to Player 2:**\n    *   This means I keep [3, 4, 0, 2, 2]. My value is: 3\\*80 + 4\\*63 + 0\\*78 + 2\\*24 + 2\\*29 = 240 + 252 + 0 + 48 + 58 = 598, which is better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Example 2: Offering [2, 4, 0, 4, 3] to Player 2:**\n    *   This means I keep [2, 3, 0, 1, 1]. My value is: 2\\*80 + 3\\*63 + 0\\*78 + 1\\*24 + 1\\*29 = 160 + 189 + 0 + 24 + 29 = 402, which is better than my outside offer.\n*   **Example 3: Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2.**\n    *   This means I keep [4, 7, 0, 5, 4]. My value is: 4\\*80 + 7\\*63 + 0\\*78 + 5\\*24 + 4\\*29 = 320 + 441 + 0 + 120 + 116 = 997, which is much better than my outside offer of 92.\n\nI will choose the third offer to start with, as it is the best for me and complies with the rules of the game.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nI should not walk away, as that would give me my outside offer of 92.\nI should make a counteroffer in line with rule #3, which says not to offer nothing or everything to the other player in the first two rounds. So I should not offer the other player [0,0,0,0,0].\nMy selected offer above [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is the highest value I can get, therefore I should keep everything.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer of what I consider to be reasonable given that it is the first round. I should keep some of the items of lower value for myself, to avoid offering the other player a very low value offer which could trigger them to walk away in subsequent rounds.\n\nLet me try again with offering the other player [1,3,0,2,2]. This would keep me with a value of 598.\nThis is still greater than my outside offer, so it is a safe offer to make.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine my best action for round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 550. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 38 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 70 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 10 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 92 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 53 per unit\n*   **Total items:** 4 units of item 1, 3 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its actual value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 times its actual value.  Since it is round 1, the discount is not relevant now.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** As the first player, I have to propose an offer. I need to calculate several potential offers and evaluate the results to determine the best course of action. I need to keep in mind to make an offer that is greater than my outside offer value, otherwise it is a mistake. I want to maximize my outcome, but I also want to make sure it's a reasonable offer. \n\n    *   **Offer 1: Keep most valuable items:** Let's start by offering the other player only the items I value the least and keeping the items I value most: offer the other player [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n        My value = (4*38) + (3*70) + (0*10) + (3*92) + (2*53) = 152 + 210 + 0 + 276 + 106 = 744. This is better than my outside offer, and seems like a good starting point.\n\n    *   **Offer 2: Split evenly (rounded down to keep remainder):** Let's try offering the other player approximately half, keeping what is left.  [2, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n         My value = (2 * 38) + (2 * 70) + (3 * 10) + (2 * 92) + (1 * 53) = 76 + 140 + 30 + 184 + 53 = 483. This is not better than my outside offer, so it is a poor choice.\n\n   *   **Offer 3: Give slightly more of the less valued items:** Let's offer the other player [1,1,4,1,0]\n        My value = (3 * 38) + (2 * 70) + (2 * 10) + (2 * 92) + (2 * 53) = 114 + 140 + 20 + 184 + 106 = 564. This is also better than my outside offer, but worse than the first offer.\n        \n    Given these calculations, offer 1, giving [0,0,6,0,0] to the other player gives me the highest value and is above my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   I should not accept any current offers since there are none.\n*   I should not walk away, because my offer is better than my outside offer.\n*   I should make a counteroffer, specifically offering the other player [0, 0, 6, 0, 0] (all of the item 3s) and keep the rest.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Your value would be:\n    38 x 0 + 70 x 3 + 10 x 1 + 92 x 3 + 53 x 1\n    which is 549 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 550. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 550\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 38, Item 2: 70, Item 3: 10, Item 4: 92, Item 5: 53\n*   **Total pool of items:** 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means that any value we get now is worth more than waiting for later rounds due to the discount.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 2, 2, 1].  This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 2 = 4\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 2 = 1\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1\n    My value for accepting this offer:\n    (3 * 38) + (2 * 70) + (4 * 10) + (1 * 92) + (1 * 53) = 114 + 140 + 40 + 92 + 53 = 439\n    Discounted value for accepting this offer: 439 * 0.9 = 395.1. This is worse than my outside offer of 550.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that yields more than 550. Let's try to keep more high-value items: I will give away some of item 3 and 1.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** Let's try offering [1, 0, 5, 0, 0]. This means I would keep\n         * Item 1: 4-1=3\n         * Item 2: 3-0=3\n         * Item 3: 6-5=1\n         * Item 4: 3-0=3\n         * Item 5: 2-0=2\n    My value: (3 * 38) + (3 * 70) + (1 * 10) + (3 * 92) + (2 * 53) = 114+210+10+276+106 = 716. This would be better than my outside offer without any discount applied.\n    Since this is better than my outside offer, let's use this.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 395.1 to me after discount, which is worse than my outside offer of 550.\n*  My counteroffer of [1, 0, 5, 0, 0] gives me a total value of 716, which is good.\n*   I should not accept the current offer and I will propose my counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 5, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me \\[1, 0, 5, 0, 0]. This means I keep:\n    * Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    * Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n    * Item 3: 6 - 5 = 1 units\n    * Item 4: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n    * Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    \n    My value for this offer is: (3 * 94) + (3 * 50) + (1 * 17) + (3 * 3) + (2 * 3) = 282 + 150 + 17 + 9 + 6 = 464\n    Adjusted by the discount factor, it becomes: 464 * 0.9 = 417.6\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 417.6 > 153. Accepting the current offer is significantly better than my outside offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider making an offer that might be more beneficial to me. In round 1 I kept [3, 2, 4, 1, 1], and in my last offer of Round 1 I proposed [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]. Player 1 seems to value item 3 (they have offered me 5 units of it), so I'm likely underestimating its value to them.\n\nLet's consider keeping [3, 3, 0, 2, 2], which would imply counteroffer of [1,0,6,1,0]. This would give me:\n(3 * 94) + (3 * 50) + (0 * 17) + (2 * 3) + (2 * 3) = 282 + 150 + 0 + 6 + 6 = 444. \nAdjusted by discount factor: 444 * 0.9 = 399.6. This is not as good as my current offer, and I am already quite happy with my current offer.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\nAccepting the current offer gives me a discounted value of 417.6, which is much higher than my outside offer of 153. I should not walk away from this.\n\nTherefore, I will accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 854\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 50\n    *   Item 2: 19\n    *   Item 3: 86\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 44\n*   **Total pool of items:** 7 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that the value of a deal in a later round is discounted. For instance, a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 (0.9 * 0.9) times its value in round 1. Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9 to the power (1-1), or 1. This will be relevant in future rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to formulate a counteroffer that is beneficial to me (i.e. worth more than 854). I also need to keep the negotiation alive by not being too greedy.\n    Let's start by calculating the value of keeping a simple offer to myself that is close to but above my outside offer: Keeping [4,3,2,4,2] for myself gives me the following value:\n    * 4 * 50 + 3 * 19 + 2 * 86 + 4 * 3 + 2 * 44 = 200 + 57 + 172 + 12 + 88 = 529\n    This is not better than my outside offer, so I will now attempt to keep more.\n\n    Let's now try keeping: [5, 4, 2, 5, 3]\n    * 5 * 50 + 4 * 19 + 2 * 86 + 5 * 3 + 3 * 44 = 250 + 76 + 172 + 15 + 132 = 645\n    This is still not better than my outside offer. Let's try again.\n\n    Let's now try keeping [6, 5, 2, 6, 3]\n    * 6 * 50 + 5 * 19 + 2 * 86 + 6 * 3 + 3 * 44 = 300 + 95 + 172 + 18 + 132 = 717. Still not good enough.\n\n    Let's try keeping [6, 5, 3, 6, 3] \n    * 6 * 50 + 5 * 19 + 3 * 86 + 6 * 3 + 3 * 44 = 300 + 95 + 258 + 18 + 132 = 803\n    Still not better than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try keeping [6, 5, 3, 7, 3]\n    * 6 * 50 + 5 * 19 + 3 * 86 + 7 * 3 + 3 * 44 = 300 + 95 + 258 + 21 + 132 = 806\n    This still isn't good enough.\n\n    Let's now try keeping [7, 5, 3, 7, 3].\n    * 7 * 50 + 5 * 19 + 3 * 86 + 7 * 3 + 3 * 44 = 350 + 95 + 258 + 21 + 132 = 856. This is better than my outside offer. So this allocation is worth keeping in mind.\n\n    This corresponds to offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] to Player 2. Let's consider this.\n\n    If I keep [7, 4, 3, 6, 3] the value is\n    * 7 * 50 + 4 * 19 + 3 * 86 + 6 * 3 + 3 * 44 = 350 + 76 + 258 + 18 + 132 = 834 which is less than my outside offer.\n    If I keep [7, 5, 3, 6, 3] the value is\n    * 7 * 50 + 5 * 19 + 3 * 86 + 6 * 3 + 3 * 44 = 350 + 95 + 258 + 18 + 132 = 853 which is less than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's keep [7, 5, 3, 7, 3] which is worth 856. This will be my target allocation.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nI should not accept as there is no offer on the table. I also shouldn't walk away, as there may be offers that get above the value of my outside offer. Therefore, I should make an offer that allows me to keep [7, 5, 3, 7, 3], and offer the rest to Player 2. This means offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] to Player 2. This is better than my outside offer value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    61 x 1 + 83 x 1 + 52 x 2 + 78 x 1 + 43 x 0\n    which is 326 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 327. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

So, this offer is good for me\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I will start by analyzing some offers to see what I can propose. If I were to propose an offer where I keep 3 units of each item (keep [3,3,3,3,3]), then I would get:\n    *   3 * 61 + 3 * 83 + 3 * 52 + 3 * 78 + 3 * 43 = 183 + 249 + 156 + 234 + 129 = 951\n    This is better than the outside offer of 327, so this seems to be a good place to start.\n    \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 1673 to me which is greater than the outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 413\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 54\n    *   Item 2: 71\n    *   Item 3: 97\n    *   Item 4: 62\n    *   Item 5: 62\n*   **Total item pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 6\n    *   Item 2: 8\n    *   Item 3: 1\n    *   Item 4: 1\n    *   Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 1, the discount factor does not apply yet.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an initial offer. Let's start by thinking about offering equal shares. Because some items have uneven quantities I need to round down for a starting point. If we round down the number of each item, the other player would get 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\n    * This means that we would keep 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\n    *   Value of keeping 3 of item 1: 3 * 54 = 162\n    *   Value of keeping 4 of item 2: 4 * 71 = 284\n    *   Value of keeping 1 of item 3: 1 * 97 = 97\n    *   Value of keeping 1 of item 4: 1 * 62 = 62\n    *   Value of keeping 1 of item 5: 1 * 62 = 62\n    *   Total value of keeping this = 162 + 284 + 97 + 62 + 62 = 667\n\n    This initial counteroffer, which keeps an equal (or nearly equal amount of every type of item) is worth more than my outside offer of 413.\n\n    Let's evaluate a few more potential offers to make sure there isn't something more advantageous available.\n\n    If I offer 0 items of everything I keep it all which is worth 1175 and this is a high value. If I offer all the items to the other player, I keep nothing, which is worth 0, which is not good. So now I know not to choose those options.\n\n    Next I'll evaluate a counteroffer where I keep all of the items of high value to me and offer the rest. This means I offer to the other player 6 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5 and I will keep 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3 and 1 unit of item 4 and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of keeping 0 of item 1: 0 * 54 = 0\n    *   Value of keeping 0 of item 2: 0 * 71 = 0\n    *   Value of keeping 1 of item 3: 1 * 97 = 97\n    *   Value of keeping 1 of item 4: 1 * 62 = 62\n    *   Value of keeping 0 of item 5: 0 * 62 = 0\n    *   Total value of keeping this = 0 + 0 + 97 + 62 + 0 = 159\n    This is less than my outside offer, so I won't make this counteroffer.\n\n    Another potential counteroffer is to offer player 2 the least valuable items, keeping all of the other items for myself. This means I offer to the other player 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5 and I will keep 6 unit of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of keeping 6 of item 1: 6 * 54 = 324\n    *   Value of keeping 8 of item 2: 8 * 71 = 568\n    *   Value of keeping 1 of item 3: 1 * 97 = 97\n    *   Value of keeping 1 of item 4: 1 * 62 = 62\n    *   Value of keeping 2 of item 5: 2 * 62 = 124\n    *   Total value of keeping this = 324 + 568 + 97 + 62 + 124= 1175\n    This is my total value. This is great but also could be too much to ask from player 2.\n\n    Let's go with the equal share offer as my first move.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The initial equal share counteroffer has a value of 667, which is much higher than my outside offer of 413.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer, since there isn't one on the table.\n*   I should not walk away, since I have potential offers that exceed my outside offer.\n*   I will propose the equal share counteroffer to begin with.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 6, 1, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 1 + 63 x 6 + 14 x 1 + 100 x 1 + 20 x 0\n    which is 501 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 502. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 4, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 4, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means I would receive 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 2.\n    *   My value from this offer: (1 * 9) + (1 * 63) + (0 * 14) + (0 * 100) + (0 * 20) = 72\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 72 * 0.9 = 64.8\n\n*   **Value of Current Offer Compared to Outside Offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (64.8) is significantly less than my outside offer (502). Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Consider a counteroffer:** Let's consider an offer that would be better than our outside offer, which means it must be better than 502/0.9 = 557.77.\n    \n    I currently have a very strong preference for item 4 (value 100). I will try to keep this for myself and items 2 and 5. Let's start with an offer that gives player 1 only items 1 and 3.\n    Let's try an offer where player 1 gets [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]. I keep [2, 8, 1, 1, 2]. The value for me is:\n    2 * 9 + 8 * 63 + 1 * 14 + 1 * 100 + 2 * 20 = 18 + 504 + 14 + 100 + 40 = 676\n   \n    \n    This is better than my discounted outside option. 676 > 557.77.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n*  The counter offer I calculated is better than the outside offer and is not worse than my previous offer.\n*  Therefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 413. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1038 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 2, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 5 + 71 x 2 + 97 x 0 + 62 x 0 + 62 x 0\n    which is 412 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 413. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 4, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 157. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 0 + 38 x 0 + 54 x 0 + 77 x 2 + 22 x 0\n    which is 154 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 157. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 157\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 53\n    *   Item 2: 38\n    *   Item 3: 54\n    *   Item 4: 77\n    *   Item 5: 22\n*   **Total items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 2\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that the value of any deal struck in a later round is discounted by 0.9 for each round that it is delayed. For example, a deal in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times the value it would have had if agreed to in round 1, and a deal in round 3 will be worth 0.81 times the value if it had been agreed in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3\n   The value of this offer is:\n    *   2 * 53 + 3 * 38 + 1 * 54 + 2 * 77 + 3 * 22 = 106 + 114 + 54 + 154 + 66 = 494\n\n    This is much greater than my outside offer of 157.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider the value of various counter offers to ensure I don't make a mistake. A counter offer must at minimum give me a value greater than my outside offer, or I should just walk. \n    *   Let's consider a counter offer where I keep [2,3,1,2,3]  (as would be implied by player 1's offer), this is worth 494. This is better than my outside option.\n    *   Let's consider a counter offer where I keep only item 4, say [0,0,0,2,0]. This is worth 154, which is worse than my outside option, so it is a bad counteroffer.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer gives me a value of 494, which is greater than my outside offer of 157.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is better than my outside offer.\n*   Making a counteroffer now might lead to an even better outcome later, but the counter offer must be better than the outside offer to prevent mistake #2. \n*   Since it is only round 1, and we don't know what Player 1 is valuing each item, it is potentially valuable to try to improve my outcome from the current offer of 494. Let's try to be aggressive in this first round. \n    *   Let's make a counter offer where I propose giving Player 1 [0,0,0,0,0]. This would mean I would keep [3,4,2,2,5] which is a value of 3*53 + 4*38 + 2*54 + 2*77 + 5*22 = 159 + 152 + 108 + 154 + 110 = 683. This would be much better for me, so I will make this offer, as it is more aggressive than the implicit offer of keeping [2,3,1,2,3].\n    * Let's ensure we are not making mistake 1. We do not have a previous offer, so we are not making a worse offer.\n    * Let's ensure we are not making mistake 2. Our new offer to keep [3,4,2,2,5] is worth 683, which is better than the outside offer of 157.\n    * Let's ensure we are not making mistake 3, by offering all items or no items. I am not offering all items nor no items, but instead offering the best possible outcome for myself.\n    * Let's ensure we are not making mistake 4 or 5. We have not accepted any offer, nor walked away from any offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 157.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 53\n    *   Item 2: 38\n    *   Item 3: 54\n    *   Item 4: 77\n    *   Item 5: 22\n*   **Total items:** 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** Gamma (\u03b3) = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor is \u03b3^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9. This means any value I get from accepting or making an offer now will be multiplied by 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would keep [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]\n    *   Value of keeping: (2 * 53) + (3 * 38) + (1 * 54) + (1 * 77) + (4 * 22) = 106 + 114 + 54 + 77 + 88 = 439\n    *   Discounted value of accepting the offer now: 439 * 0.9 = 395.1\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me more than 157/0.9=174.44 before discount. I should also not repeat the mistake made in round 1 and offer nothing. Here are a few options:\n    *   Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to the opponent and keep [3, 4, 2, 2, 5]. My value will be: 3 * 53 + 4 * 38 + 2 * 54 + 2 * 77 + 5 * 22 = 159 + 152 + 108 + 154 + 110 = 683 which is significantly better than my outside offer even with the discount factor.\n    *  Offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] keeping [3, 4, 1, 2, 5]. My value is: 3 * 53 + 4 * 38 + 1 * 54 + 2 * 77 + 5 * 22 = 159 + 152 + 54 + 154 + 110 = 629. Better than the current offer, and better than my outside offer. This may be preferable as it is slightly less aggressive and so more likely to be accepted.\n    *  Offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] keeping [3, 4, 2, 1, 5]. My value is: 3 * 53 + 4 * 38 + 2 * 54 + 1 * 77 + 5 * 22 = 159 + 152 + 108 + 77 + 110 = 606. Better than the current offer, and better than my outside offer.\n*  **Comparison:**\n    *   The current offer of [1,1,1,1,1] gives me 395.1, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 157. However, it is less than what I can achieve if I counteroffer. Therefore, I should not accept it. I want to make sure that what I keep is worth more than my outside offer of 157.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will not accept the current offer because I can get much more by making a counteroffer.\n*   I will not walk away since a counteroffer will be better than the outside offer.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that is significantly better for me than the current offer. I propose to offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] meaning that I keep [3,4,1,2,5].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Since it is round 3, the discount will be applied as 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  My value for this offer would be:\n    (0 * 39) + (0 * 29) + (1 * 13) + (0 * 32) + (0 * 5) = 13.\n    The discounted value of accepting this offer would be 13 * 0.81 = 10.53\n*   This is significantly lower than my outside offer, so I should not accept.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since this is the final round, a counteroffer from player 2 is treated as a WALK, so if I make a counteroffer, it will effectively be the final offer, which I must then evaluate whether it is better than my outside offer, and whether it is better than walking away (which would get me 66). My aim with a counteroffer will be to maximize the value to myself, while keeping enough items that my value is at least as good as my outside offer.\n\n    Let's consider keeping all items and offering nothing to player 2 and calculate the value of this to me. \n   *  3 units of item 1: 3 * 39 = 117\n   *  4 units of item 2: 4 * 29 = 116\n   *  2 units of item 3: 2 * 13 = 26\n   *  2 units of item 4: 2 * 32 = 64\n   *  5 units of item 5: 5 * 5 = 25\n   * Total value = 117 + 116 + 26 + 64 + 25 = 348\n   This total value is greater than the value of my outside offer and is greater than if I accepted the current offer. If I were to offer nothing, this has a value of 348 which discounted is 348 * 0.81 = 281.88.\n   This is clearly the best offer for myself, and it's better than my outside offer and the current offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n    Since this is the final round, the optimal decision is to make a counteroffer that gives all items to myself.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 381. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 627 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 35 x 0 + 92 x 1 + 28 x 3 + 34 x 6\n    which is 380 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 381. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 381\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 20\n    *   Item 2: 35\n    *   Item 3: 92\n    *   Item 4: 28\n    *   Item 5: 34\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 7\n    *   Item 2: 1\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 1, the discount factor will be 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1.0. Therefore, there is no discounting for this round, but it is useful to remember for subsequent rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so no need to assess its value.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** As player 1, I am making the first offer. I need to determine an offer that is advantageous to me and that is likely to encourage agreement. I must also make sure that it is better than my outside offer, otherwise it is an immediate mistake to propose it.\n    Let's start by considering a very conservative counteroffer, offering half of each item to the other player. Since this is not always possible, we will round down, but try to keep a good balance between the items offered. We will keep the following number of items:\n\n    *   Item 1: 7 - 3 = 4\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 6 - 3 = 3\n\n    The value of these items to me is:\n    (4 * 20) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 92) + (2 * 28) + (3 * 34) = 80 + 35 + 184 + 56 + 102 = 457.\n\n    Since 457 > 381, this is a valid offer. I also do not want to make the mistake of offering no items or all items, so this seems like a good place to start.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept, because there is no current offer on the table.\n*   I should not walk away, because I have a potential counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n*   I should make the counteroffer calculated above. The items offered are the opposite of what I keep:\n\n    * Item 1 offered: 7 - 4 = 3\n    * Item 2 offered: 1 - 1 = 0\n    * Item 3 offered: 4 - 2 = 2\n    * Item 4 offered: 3 - 2 = 1\n    * Item 5 offered: 6 - 3 = 3\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 1, 3]}\n```\n",

This means that an agreement in later rounds is worth less to both players than an agreement in earlier rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 0, 2, 1, 3]. This means I keep [7-3, 1-0, 4-2, 3-1, 6-3] = [4, 1, 2, 2, 3].\n    *   My value for accepting this offer would be:\n        (4 * 52) + (1 * 80) + (2 * 55) + (2 * 80) + (3 * 81) = 208 + 80 + 110 + 160 + 243 = 801.\n\n*   **Comparison to my outside offer:** My outside offer is 1203, and the current offer is only worth 801 to me. The current offer is less than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.

Too low.\n    * Offer: [0,0,0,0,1] -> My value = [7,1,4,3,5] = 7*52+1*80+4*55+3*80+5*81 = 364 + 80 + 220+ 240 + 405 = 1309\n\n    Let me consider offer of giving [2, 0, 1, 1, 1] to the other party, meaning I keep [5, 1, 3, 2, 5], which is worth 1070. This is worse than my outside offer.\n    Let me consider offer of giving [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] to the other party, meaning I keep [6, 1, 3, 2, 6], which is worth 6*52 + 1*80 + 3*55 + 2*80 + 6*81 = 312 + 80 + 165 + 160 + 486 = 1203 which is the same as the outside offer.\n    Let me consider an offer where I keep more of items I value highly, and give away the rest: offer [2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. My value will then be 5*52 + 1*80 + 2*55 + 3*80 + 4*81 = 260+80+110+240+324 = 1014, this is lower than the outside offer.\n    \n    Let me consider keeping [6, 1, 3, 2, 5] and offer [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] my total value is 1202, again, lower than outside offer. \n    Let me offer [1,0,0,0,0]. That means I keep [6,1,4,3,6] = 6*52 + 1*80 + 4*55 + 3*80 + 6*81 = 312 + 80 + 220 + 240 + 486 = 1338.\n\n    I will make an offer keeping [6, 1, 3, 2, 5]. The offer to P1 will be [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This results in a value for me of 1202, which is less than my outside offer of 1203.\n    I will make an offer keeping [6, 1, 4, 3, 5], which means offering [1,0,0,0,1] to the other party. My value for this is 1309.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is unacceptable as it is worse than my outside offer.\n*  I will propose a counteroffer of [1,0,0,0,1], which is worth 1309 to me.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1203. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1044 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 1, 3, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 6 + 80 x 1 + 55 x 3 + 80 x 3 + 81 x 5\n    which is 1202 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1203. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 2, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we are in round 2, if we reach a deal now, the value will be multiplied by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9. The discount factor will affect our decision of accepting vs holding out for a better deal in a future round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 0, 1, 1, 2]. This means I would keep 7-2=5 units of item 1, 1-0=1 unit of item 2, 4-1=3 units of item 3, 3-1=2 units of item 4 and 6-2=4 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer: (5 * 52) + (1 * 80) + (3 * 55) + (2 * 80) + (4 * 81) = 260 + 80 + 165 + 160 + 324 = 989\n    *   Since we are in round 2, we discount this by 0.9 to get 989 * 0.9 = 890.1\n    *   This value is lower than my outside offer of 1203. So accepting this is a Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep the majority of the valuable items. I'll start by calculating what would give me a value slightly higher than my outside option.\n    *   Let's say I offer Player 1: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]. This means I keep [6, 1, 3, 3, 5]. \n        *  My value is: (6 * 52) + (1 * 80) + (3 * 55) + (3 * 80) + (5 * 81) = 312 + 80 + 165 + 240 + 405 = 1202. Which is still less than my outside option, so this offer would be a Mistake 2.\n    *   Let's say I offer Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep [7, 1, 4, 3, 6]\n         * My value is: (7 * 52) + (1 * 80) + (4 * 55) + (3 * 80) + (6 * 81) = 364 + 80 + 220 + 240 + 486 = 1390. This is greater than my outside option. This offer is good for me. But this offer is bad for player 1, this is Mistake 3.\n    *   Let's try offering Player 1: [2, 0, 1, 0, 2]. This means I keep [5, 1, 3, 3, 4]\n        * My value is (5 * 52) + (1 * 80) + (3 * 55) + (3 * 80) + (4 * 81) = 260 + 80 + 165 + 240 + 324 = 1069 which is less than my outside offer.\n    *   Let's try offering Player 1: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I keep [6, 1, 4, 3, 5]\n        * My value is (6 * 52) + (1 * 80) + (4 * 55) + (3 * 80) + (5 * 81) = 312 + 80 + 220 + 240 + 405 = 1257\n        * This offer of 1257 is better than my outside offer of 1203.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer (890.1 < 1203) and is a Mistake 4, so I should not accept.\n*   The counteroffer of giving [1, 0, 0, 0, 1] is better than my outside offer (1257 > 1203).\n*   Walking away is less than the counteroffer, and should not be done.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer [1, 0, 0, 0, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 340. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 340. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 783 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 4, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 1 + 80 x 0 + 1 x 4 + 80 x 4 + 88 x 0\n    which is 336 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 340. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action for round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 340\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 12, Item 2: 80, Item 3: 1, Item 4: 80, Item 5: 88\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1, so we do not need to apply the discount factor at this time.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so my value is not applicable.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer, and it should be better than my outside offer value of 340. I will explore some options for counteroffers, with the ultimate goal of making an offer that is beneficial for myself. This means that I want to try to keep high value items for myself, while offering low value items to the other player.\n\nLet's examine some potential counteroffers. Remember, I'm offering the listed amount of each item to Player 2 and keeping the rest:\n\n*   **Option A (Offering 0 of each item):** I keep [5, 3, 4, 5, 1]. My value is (5 * 12) + (3 * 80) + (4 * 1) + (5 * 80) + (1 * 88) = 60 + 240 + 4 + 400 + 88 = 792. This is my total value of all the items, and is better than my outside offer. This however is not a good opening offer as it is unlikely to be accepted.\n*   **Option B (Offering 1 of each item):** I keep [4, 2, 3, 4, 0]. My value is (4 * 12) + (2 * 80) + (3 * 1) + (4 * 80) + (0 * 88) = 48 + 160 + 3 + 320 + 0 = 531. This is better than my outside offer. I would offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n*   **Option C (Offering 2 of each item where available, otherwise the available amount):** I keep [3, 1, 2, 3, 0]. My value is (3 * 12) + (1 * 80) + (2 * 1) + (3 * 80) + (0 * 88) = 36 + 80 + 2 + 240 + 0 = 358. This is better than my outside offer. I would offer [2, 2, 2, 2, 1].\n*   **Option D (Offering all of item 3):** I keep [5, 3, 0, 5, 1]. My value is (5 * 12) + (3 * 80) + (0 * 1) + (5 * 80) + (1 * 88) = 60 + 240 + 0 + 400 + 88 = 788. This is better than my outside offer. I would offer [0, 0, 4, 0, 0].\n*   **Option E (Offering all of item 1 and item 3):** I keep [0, 3, 0, 5, 1]. My value is (0 * 12) + (3 * 80) + (0 * 1) + (5 * 80) + (1 * 88) = 0 + 240 + 0 + 400 + 88 = 728. This is better than my outside offer. I would offer [5, 0, 4, 0, 0].\n*   **Option F (Offering 1 of item 2 and 1 of item 4):** I keep [5, 2, 4, 4, 1]. My value is (5 * 12) + (2 * 80) + (4 * 1) + (4 * 80) + (1 * 88) = 60 + 160 + 4 + 320 + 88 = 632. This is better than my outside offer. I would offer [0, 1, 0, 1, 0].\n\nI need to select one of the above offers. I want to be more generous, so I will offer the counter offer with Option B, as offering a more generous offer at the start might lead to an agreement more quickly.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer based on Option B, as this is beneficial for me and is more likely to be accepted compared to Option A (offering no items).\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

I need to make sure I don't accept an offer worth less than 272 (Mistake 4). I also must make sure I don't make an offer worse than my outside offer (Mistake 2). I must also ensure I am not making an offer worse than my previous offers (Mistake 1). \n        *  I will choose to make a counteroffer that maximizes my value and is better than my outside offer, while giving the other player a chance at a reasonable offer.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 4, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 1 + 80 x 0 + 1 x 4 + 80 x 4 + 88 x 0\n    which is 336 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 340. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

Since we are in round three, if I don't make a deal, there will be no more negotiations. I must make a decision that is in my best interest immediately.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer has a present value of 566.19 which is much better than my outside offer of 340.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer gives me a present value of 566.19, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 340. Therefore, it would be a mistake to walk away or offer a worse deal.\n*   Since this is the last round, I should either accept the current offer, or make a counteroffer that I find acceptable.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 0 + 70 x 0 + 20 x 5 + 39 x 0 + 19 x 0\n    which is 100 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 104. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that any deal in later rounds will be worth less than the same deal made in earlier rounds. Specifically, round 2 will be discounted by 0.9, and round 3 will be discounted by 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since this is round 1, I need to make an initial offer. I must calculate the value of keeping different amounts of items, compared to my outside offer value. Remember that my goal is to maximize the discounted value of my items, which must be higher than my outside offer to be acceptable.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI need to make an initial offer. Since I don't know anything about player 2, I'll make a fair-ish offer and not be overly aggressive, as the first offer. I'll start by offering half of each item to Player 2 (or the closest integer if odd): \n\n* Offering Player 2: 4 of Item 1, 1 of Item 2, 2 of Item 3, 2 of Item 4 and 1 of Item 5\n\nThat means I would keep: 4 of Item 1, 1 of Item 2, 3 of Item 3, 3 of Item 4, and 2 of Item 5.\nMy value would be: (4 * 76) + (1 * 70) + (3 * 20) + (3 * 39) + (2 * 19) = 304 + 70 + 60 + 117 + 38 = 589. This is significantly higher than my outside option.\n\nThis seems like a good starting point. I would be making an offer that yields me a value of 589.\n\nSince this is higher than my outside offer, and I have no offers on the table, I should propose this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 2, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 0 + 70 x 0 + 20 x 5 + 39 x 0 + 19 x 0\n    which is 100 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 104. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 1, 2, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 2, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 104.\n*   **Item values:** My values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 76\n    *   Item 2: 70\n    *   Item 3: 20\n    *   Item 4: 39\n    *   Item 5: 19\n*   **Total pool of items:** 8 units of item 1, 2 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** Gamma is 0.9. This means that if I accept a deal in round 2, the value of the deal will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. If I accept in round 3, the value will be multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [2, 1, 2, 4, 1], which means Player 2 is offering me 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This means I keep 8-2 = 6 units of item 1, 2-1 = 1 unit of item 2, 5-2 = 3 units of item 3, 5-4 = 1 unit of item 4, and 3-1 = 2 units of item 5. Let's calculate the value of what I would keep:\n    *   6 units of item 1: 6 * 76 = 456\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 70 = 70\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 20 = 60\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 39 = 39\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 19 = 38\n    *   Total value if I accept: 456 + 70 + 60 + 39 + 38 = 663\n    *   Discounted value: 663 * 0.9 = 596.7\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to consider what I could offer that would give me a better outcome than my outside offer. Let's try keeping a more balanced share (close to half) of each item that yields a value greater than my discounted outside offer of 104 * 0.9 = 93.6. If it is better to accept, I will, otherwise I will counter offer.\n    *   Let's consider offering Player 2 [3, 0, 2, 2, 1]. This means I keep 5 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 2 of item 5. Value to me:\n        *   5 * 76 + 2 * 70 + 3 * 20 + 3 * 39 + 2 * 19 = 380 + 140 + 60 + 117 + 38 = 735. This value is much better than my outside offer. \n        *  Discounted value: 735 * 0.9 = 661.5\n     * Let's consider offering Player 2 [4,1,2,2,1]. This means I keep 4 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 2 of item 5. Value to me:\n        * 4 * 76 + 1 * 70 + 3 * 20 + 3 * 39 + 2 * 19 = 304 + 70 + 60 + 117 + 38 = 589. This is less than the current offer.\n        * Discounted value: 589 * 0.9 = 530.1\n    \n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer gives me a discounted value of 596.7, which is much higher than my discounted outside offer of 93.6. Therefore, accepting is much better than walking away. However, if I offer Player 2 [3,0,2,2,1] then this value for me is 661.5. As my offer is better than the discounted value of the offer on the table I should make a counter offer of [3,0,2,2,1] instead of accepting the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be applied to the final value at the end of round 2. So any final value from this round would be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. Any value from a future round 3 deal would be discounted by a factor of 0.9^2\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 0, 2, 2, 1]. This means I would keep the following items:\n    *   Item 1: 8 - 3 = 5\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n\n    My value for this offer:\n    (5 * 37) + (2 * 54) + (3 * 55) + (3 * 27) + (2 * 59) = 185 + 108 + 165 + 81 + 118 = 657\n     Since this is round 2, we need to apply the discount factor of 0.9: 657 * 0.9 = 591.3\n\n    *   **Comparison to my outside offer:** 591.3 > 190. The current offer, even with the discount factor, is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer that is better for me, but fair to Player 1. The previous round, I offered [2, 1, 2, 4, 1]. The current offer to me is worse than that as I value the higher value items and received less of them in this offer. Let's calculate the value of keeping 5 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5. This is what I would have if I accepted the current offer and is worth 657, as calculated earlier. Therefore, let's propose keeping 6 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5. The values of these items are (6 * 37) + (2 * 54) + (4 * 55) + (3 * 27) + (2 * 59) = 222 + 108 + 220 + 81 + 118= 749.\n    We will therefore offer Player 1 [2, 0, 1, 2, 1].

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since this is round 3, the discount factor to be applied is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [2, 0, 1, 2, 1]. This means I keep:\n    * Item 1: 8 - 2 = 6\n    * Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2\n    * Item 3: 5 - 1 = 4\n    * Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n    * Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n    My value for keeping these items is:\n    (6 * 76) + (2 * 70) + (4 * 20) + (3 * 39) + (2 * 19) = 456 + 140 + 80 + 117 + 38 = 831\n    Applying the discount factor, the present value of accepting this offer is 831 * 0.81 = 673.11\n\n    My value for accepting the current offer (673.11) is greater than my outside offer value (104).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**  Since this is the last round, making a counteroffer is equivalent to walking away.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 854. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 854. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 543 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 5, 5, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 5 + 13 x 5 + 76 x 5 + 47 x 5 + 26 x 3\n    which is 853 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 854. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

To avoid mistake #2, I must make sure what I keep is worth at least 854. Let's explore a few options, always calculating what I keep, and giving the remainder to Player 2:\n\n    *   **Option A: Keep most of the high value items and offer most of the low value items.** Keep [7, 6, 4, 4, 2].

This leaves [2, 2, 1, 1, 1] for Player 2.\n        My value for option C is: (5 * 19) + (4 * 13) + (4 * 76) + (4 * 47) + (2 * 26) = 95 + 52 + 304 + 188 + 52 = 691. This is less than 854.\n   *   **Option D: Try to offer most of the low value items and keep as much as I can of the high value items and as few as I can of the low value items.** Keep [6,5,5,5,2].

Still less than 854.\n\nI will need to modify my offer to ensure my kept items are valued at greater than 854. Let's try keeping all items of types 3 and 4 and then trying to add in some low value items.\n* **Option P: Keep [7,6,5,5,1].** This leaves [0,0,0,0,2] for player 2.\n     My value for Option P is: (7*19) + (6*13) + (5*76) + (5*47) + (1*26) = 133+78+380+235+26= 852. Still less than 854.\n* **Option Q: Keep [6,6,5,5,2].** This leaves [1,0,0,0,1] for player 2.\n      My value for Option Q is: (6*19) + (6*13) + (5*76) + (5*47) + (2*26) = 114 + 78 + 380 + 235 + 52 = 859. This is greater than my outside offer value of 854!\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will propose counteroffer **Option Q**, keeping [6, 6, 5, 5, 2] for myself, and offering the rest, [1, 0, 0, 0, 1], to Player 2.\nThis is my first offer, and it has a value of 859 for myself, which is greater than my outside offer value of 854.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 6, 4, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 7 + 60 x 6 + 20 x 4 + 66 x 5 + 49 x 3\n    which is 1456 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1461. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1461\n*   **My values per item:** \n    *   Item 1: 77\n    *   Item 2: 60\n    *   Item 3: 20\n    *   Item 4: 66\n    *   Item 5: 49\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 7\n    *   Item 2: 6\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an agreement in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times the value of a round 1 agreement, and an agreement in round 3 will be worth 0.81 times the value of a round 1 agreement. This influences the value of waiting compared to taking a deal now.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 77 = 77\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 60 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 20 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 66 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 49 = 49\n    *   Total value of current offer: 77 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 49 = 126\n*  **My potential counteroffers** Before making a counteroffer, I need to make sure that the remaining items have value greater than my outside option of 1461.\n    * Let's start with the inverse of player 1's offer and see where that gets us. [6,6,5,5,2]\n    6 * 77 = 462\n    6 * 60 = 360\n    5 * 20 = 100\n    5 * 66 = 330\n    2 * 49 = 98\n    462 + 360 + 100 + 330 + 98 = 1350\n    This is still less than 1461.\n    * Let's try giving away less. I'll offer player 1 [0,0,0,0,0] and keep all my own items. [7, 6, 5, 5, 3]\n    7 * 77 = 539\n    6 * 60 = 360\n    5 * 20 = 100\n    5 * 66 = 330\n    3 * 49 = 147\n    539 + 360 + 100 + 330 + 147 = 1476. This is good, as it's above my outside offer.\n   \n    \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The value of accepting the current offer (126) is significantly lower than my outside offer value of 1461, so it would be a mistake to accept. My offer of keeping all items (1476) is higher than my outside offer of 1461.\n    \n    \n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   **Accept current offer:** No, the value (126) is much lower than my outside offer (1461). Mistake 4.\n*   **Walk away:** No, I can make a counteroffer with a better outcome. Mistake 5.\n*   **Propose a counteroffer:** Yes. I'll offer player 1 nothing of each item to get myself 1476. This is better than my outside offer of 1461.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1461\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 77\n    *   Item 2: 60\n    *   Item 3: 20\n    *   Item 4: 66\n    *   Item 5: 49\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 7\n    *   Item 2: 6\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor is applied as 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This means I keep [7, 5, 5, 5, 2].\n    *   Value of my current offer: (7 * 77) + (5 * 60) + (5 * 20) + (5 * 66) + (2 * 49) = 539 + 300 + 100 + 330 + 98 = 1367\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 1367 * 0.9 = 1230.3\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I will consider different counteroffers to see if I can get a better result. I need to make sure that the value of any counteroffer to me after discount is greater than my outside offer value of 1461. Also, in order to prevent any mistakes, I need to compare any potential offer that I get with my outside offer at current discount factor.\n\n    I'll start by evaluating the last offer I made in round 1 which was [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] meaning I kept all items.\n    * Value of keeping all items: (7 * 77) + (6 * 60) + (5 * 20) + (5 * 66) + (3 * 49) = 539 + 360 + 100 + 330 + 147 = 1476\n    * Discounted Value: 1476 * 0.9 = 1328.4\n\n    It seems the previous counteroffer would be better for me than accepting the current offer. Let's test an offer where I keep at least one item from each category, meaning I offer the others to Player 1. I will keep [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] meaning I offer [6, 5, 4, 4, 2]\n    * Value of offer: (1 * 77) + (1 * 60) + (1 * 20) + (1 * 66) + (1 * 49) = 77 + 60 + 20 + 66 + 49 = 272\n    * Since this is not even greater than my outside offer, I need to propose something that benefits me more.\n\n    Lets try to keep at least half or more of the items, giving the rest away to player 1. \n    I keep: [4, 3, 3, 3, 2]. Then the offer to player 1 would be [3, 3, 2, 2, 1]\n    * Value of offer: (4 * 77) + (3 * 60) + (3 * 20) + (3 * 66) + (2 * 49) = 308 + 180 + 60 + 198 + 98 = 844\n    * Discounted Value: 844 * 0.9 = 759.6\n   \n    I will test keeping [5, 4, 3, 3, 2] meaning I offer [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n    *Value of offer: (5*77) + (4*60) + (3*20) + (3*66) + (2*49) = 385 + 240 + 60 + 198 + 98 = 981\n    *Discounted Value: 981*0.9 = 882.9\n\n    I will try keeping [5, 4, 4, 4, 2] meaning I offer [2, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n    * Value of offer: (5 * 77) + (4 * 60) + (4 * 20) + (4 * 66) + (2 * 49) = 385 + 240 + 80 + 264 + 98 = 1067\n    * Discounted Value: 1067 * 0.9 = 960.3\n\n    I will try keeping [6, 5, 4, 4, 2] meaning I offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n    * Value of offer: (6 * 77) + (5 * 60) + (4 * 20) + (4 * 66) + (2 * 49) = 462 + 300 + 80 + 264 + 98 = 1204\n    * Discounted Value: 1204*0.9 = 1083.6\n\n    It seems that the offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] I made before is still the best value I have from the calculations. This is better than the current offer from player 1 and my outside offer value. \n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 1230.3, which is less than my discounted outside offer at 1461 and the value of my previous counteroffer is also greater than my outside offer. Therefore, I will make my previous counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 854. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 854. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 543 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 5, 5, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 5 + 13 x 5 + 76 x 5 + 47 x 5 + 26 x 3\n    which is 853 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 854. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 854\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 19, Item 2: 13, Item 3: 76, Item 4: 47, Item 5: 26\n*   **Total items:** 7 units of item 1, 6 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.

I am on the last round. If I walk, I get 854. Therefore, it is better to walk than to accept the current offer.\n*   Any counteroffer I make would be the last one, and thus, if Player 2 makes any counteroffer in response it will be equivalent to walking. Therefore, if I make a counteroffer, I must ensure that the discounted value is better than my outside offer.\n*   Let us consider another counteroffer, in case I was to make a counteroffer instead of accepting what I have: If I offer [0,0,0,0,0] to player 2, this means I keep all items, which has a value to me of 904. The discounted value at the current round (3) is 904 * .81 = 732.24. This is significantly less than my outside offer.\n\nSince any deal in this round will be discounted by 0.81, it is better for me to walk and take my outside offer of 854.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 30\n    *   Item 2: 42\n    *   Item 3: 26\n    *   Item 4: 35\n    *   Item 5: 66\n*   **Total Item Pool:** The total items are: 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 4 of item 5\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9.  This means that any deal reached in later rounds is worth slightly less than a deal in an earlier round. In round 1, the discount factor will be 0.9^(1-1) = 1.0, which means it won't affect the value this turn.\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer. My goal is to maximize my value, but not make offers that are obviously bad for myself or the opponent, which would be an instance of mistake 3. I must also ensure that the offer is better than my outside offer. I need to think about how I might allocate items to Player 2 in order to have the total value of my remaining items be higher than my outside offer value. Let's evaluate a few options:\n\n    *   **Option 1: Offer a small amount to the opponent:** Offer Player 2 one unit of item 5 (keeping the rest). My value: 30*4 + 42*2 + 26*1 + 35*1 + 66*3 = 120 + 84 + 26 + 35 + 198 = 463. This is better than my outside offer.\n    *   **Option 2: Offer a few different items to the opponent:** Offer Player 2 one unit of item 1, 1 of item 2, and 1 of item 5. My value: 30*3 + 42*1 + 26*1 + 35*1 + 66*3 = 90 + 42 + 26 + 35 + 198 = 391. This is better than my outside offer.\n\n    I will go with option 2 to start with as it provides a good initial starting point and does not give away too much.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   Given that there is no current offer, I should not accept or walk, since I need to be the one to make the first offer in round 1.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer of one unit of item 1, 1 of item 2 and 1 of item 5. \n\nTherefore, my action will be to make the counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 60. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 60. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 651 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 0 + 41 x 0 + 69 x 0 + 35 x 1 + 22 x 1\n    which is 57 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 60. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 60\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 50\n    *   Item 2: 41\n    *   Item 3: 69\n    *   Item 4: 35\n    *   Item 5: 22\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 1, the discount factor will be 0.9^(1-1) = 1. This means there is no discount in this round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    \n    My value for this offer is: (3 * 50) + (1 * 41) + (1 * 69) + (1 * 35) + (3 * 22) = 150 + 41 + 69 + 35 + 66 = 361.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's start by considering a counteroffer that gives me a good portion of the value while still giving something to Player 1. I want a counter offer that results in a value to me that is greater than my outside offer of 60.\n\n    Let's consider the counteroffer where I keep 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5 and therefore offer player 1 the remaining units.\n        *   Item 1: Offer 1 unit\n        *   Item 2: Offer 1 unit\n        *   Item 3: Offer 0 unit\n        *   Item 4: Offer 0 unit\n        *   Item 5: Offer 1 unit\n\n    This counteroffer corresponds to offering [1, 1, 0, 0, 1] to Player 1.\n    This counter offer has a value to me of 361, which is the same as the previous offer.\n\n    Let's consider an offer where I try and keep most of items 3 and 4, and offer more of the less valuable items 1,2 and 5\n    \n    Let's consider a counteroffer of offering Player 1 [2, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n    This means that I keep:\n         *   Item 1: 2 units (4 - 2)\n         *   Item 2: 1 unit (2 - 1)\n         *   Item 3: 1 unit (1 - 0)\n         *   Item 4: 1 unit (1 - 0)\n         *   Item 5: 2 unit (4 - 2)\n    My value = (2 * 50) + (1 * 41) + (1 * 69) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 22) = 100 + 41 + 69 + 35 + 44 = 289\n\n* **Comparison to outside offer:**\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 361, which is much better than my outside offer of 60.\n   - Offering [2,1,0,0,2] results in a value of 289, which is also much higher than my outside offer of 60.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n* The current offer of [1, 1, 0, 0, 1] is very good for me with a value of 361, significantly above my outside offer of 60. I should accept this offer. \n* Making a counter offer of [2, 1, 0, 0, 2] has a value of 289, which is better than my outside offer, but is worse than accepting the current offer of [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]. It is also an error as it is worse for me than accepting the offer which is already on the table.\n\nBased on this analysis, I should accept the current offer as it maximizes my value in this round, prevents me from making a mistake, and is much better than my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best course of action for Player 1 in this negotiation.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1676\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 94\n    *   Item 2: 80\n    *   Item 3: 86\n    *   Item 4: 11\n    *   Item 5: 85\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 8 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that if a deal is reached in round 2, its value will be multiplied by 0.9, and if in round 3, by 0.9^2 = 0.81. This encourages me to try and make a deal sooner, rather than later.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so accepting is not an option.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to consider how to propose a first counteroffer. I should aim to make an offer that is:\n    1.  Better than my outside offer for myself (avoid mistake 2)\n    2.  Not giving everything away, or keeping everything (avoid mistake 3)\n    3. Leaves some room for player 2 to be happy so that they may accept the offer\n\nLet's start with an offer that gives a roughly even share of the items to the other player and see how that calculates for me. I will try keeping 3 units of items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5:\n\n     *3 units of item 1 = 3 * 94 = 282\n     *3 units of item 2 = 3 * 80 = 240\n     *3 units of item 3 = 2 * 86 = 172 (I don't have three of this item)\n     *3 units of item 4 = 3 * 11 = 33\n     *3 units of item 5 = 3 * 85 = 255\n     *Total value for myself = 282+240+172+33+255= 982\n\nThis is worse than my outside offer. Let's try keeping a larger portion for myself:\n\nLets try an offer of giving the other party 2, 2, 0, 1, 2 of items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. This gives me a calculation of:\n\n    *3 units of item 1 = 3 * 94 = 282\n    *6 units of item 2 = 6 * 80 = 480\n    *2 units of item 3 = 2 * 86 = 172\n    *2 units of item 4 = 2 * 11 = 22\n    *4 units of item 5 = 4 * 85 = 340\n    *Total value for myself = 282+480+172+22+340= 1296\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 1676. Let's try giving away very little:\nLet's try an offer of giving the other party 1, 1, 0, 0, 1 of items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. This gives me a calculation of:\n\n    *4 units of item 1 = 4 * 94 = 376\n    *7 units of item 2 = 7 * 80 = 560\n    *2 units of item 3 = 2 * 86 = 172\n    *3 units of item 4 = 3 * 11 = 33\n    *5 units of item 5 = 5 * 85 = 425\n    *Total value for myself = 376+560+172+33+425 = 1566\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 1676. Let's try giving away as little as possible in the first offer, which means offering 0 of every item and keeping all the items for myself. This gives us:\n\n    *5 units of item 1 = 5 * 94 = 470\n    *8 units of item 2 = 8 * 80 = 640\n    *2 units of item 3 = 2 * 86 = 172\n    *3 units of item 4 = 3 * 11 = 33\n    *6 units of item 5 = 6 * 85 = 510\n    *Total value for myself = 470 + 640 + 172 + 33 + 510 = 1825\nThis is the total value of all the items, which is above my outside offer.\nI should make my first offer something reasonable, to avoid the other player immediately walking away, so I will give them a small portion of each item, while ensuring my value exceeds the outside offer. I will offer them 1,2,0,1,1.\nThis calculation looks like:\n    *4 units of item 1 = 4 * 94 = 376\n    *6 units of item 2 = 6 * 80 = 480\n    *2 units of item 3 = 2 * 86 = 172\n    *2 units of item 4 = 2 * 11 = 22\n    *5 units of item 5 = 5 * 85 = 425\n    *Total value for myself = 376 + 480 + 172 + 22 + 425 = 1475\n    This is still below my outside offer, so this offer does not make sense.\n\nLet's calculate the value of offering 0 of each item to player 2. This gives me a total value of 1825 which is greater than my outside offer of 1676. This is not ideal since it is not a cooperative offer, but it is at least better than my outside offer.\nLet's do some more calculations. If I offer 1,1,0,0,1 this would give me a value of:\n    * 4 units of item 1 = 4 * 94 = 376\n    * 7 units of item 2 = 7 * 80 = 560\n    * 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 86 = 172\n    * 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 11 = 33\n    * 5 units of item 5 = 5 * 85 = 425\n    * Total value for myself = 376 + 560 + 172 + 33 + 425 = 1566\n    This is still below 1676, so I should not accept this.\nLet's try to offer them 0,1,0,0,0. This gives me:\n    * 5 units of item 1 = 5 * 94 = 470\n    * 7 units of item 2 = 7 * 80 = 560\n    * 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 86 = 172\n    * 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 11 = 33\n    * 6 units of item 5 = 6 * 85 = 510\n    * Total value for myself = 470 + 560 + 172 + 33 + 510 = 1745\nThis is higher than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI should not accept any offer, since there is none. I will propose a counteroffer to player 2. I will offer 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 to player 2 and keep the rest for myself. This gives me a total value of 1745, which is better than my outside offer.\nTherefore, my action is to propose the offer of 0,1,0,0,0.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1560. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1041 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 8, 1, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 3 + 95 x 8 + 40 x 1 + 78 x 2 + 67 x 6\n    which is 1559 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1560. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

In round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means they are offering me 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5.

This is better than 1560, but I want to maximize my payoff.\n    Let's try keeping [5, 8, 2, 3, 5]:\n        5 * 67 + 8 * 95 + 2 * 40 + 3 * 78 + 5 * 67 = 335 + 760 + 80 + 234 + 335 = 1744.\n    Let's try keeping [5, 7, 2, 3, 6]:\n        5 * 67 + 7 * 95 + 2 * 40 + 3 * 78 + 6 * 67 = 335 + 665 + 80 + 234 + 402 = 1716\n    Let's try keeping [5, 6, 2, 3, 6]:\n        5 * 67 + 6 * 95 + 2 * 40 + 3 * 78 + 6 * 67 = 335 + 570 + 80 + 234 + 402 = 1621.\n    I should give away as little as possible while remaining better than my outside offer.\n    Let's offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].

This means that any deal made in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the nominal value of the items, while a deal in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times the nominal value of the items.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I get 0 of each item. This is worth 0 to me. 0 is much less than 1676, so I will definitely not accept.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider some counteroffers and their value to me, keeping in mind I want to maximize my value while avoiding the mistakes. We also need to factor in the discount rate.\n\n    *   **Offer 1:** Keep [5, 8, 2, 3, 6] for myself, offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2.\n        My value: (5 * 94) + (8 * 80) + (2 * 86) + (3 * 11) + (6 * 85) = 470 + 640 + 172 + 33 + 510 = 1825. With a round 2 discount, that is 1825 * 0.9 = 1642.5. This is less than my outside option. This is not a good offer to make.\n    * **Offer 2:** Offer Player 2 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep [4, 7, 2, 3, 6]. My value would be:\n     (4 * 94) + (7 * 80) + (2 * 86) + (3 * 11) + (6 * 85) = 376 + 560 + 172 + 33 + 510 = 1651. With a round 2 discount, that is 1651 * 0.9 = 1485.9. This is less than my outside option. \n    * **Offer 3:** Offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. I keep everything (as in Offer 1), value is 1825 which multiplied by the discount is 1642.5. This is worse than my outside offer.\n     * **Offer 4:** I will try to offer Player 2 more. Offer player 2 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]. I keep [5, 6, 2, 3, 6] and have a value of 1665 * 0.9 = 1498.5. Still less than my outside offer.\n     * **Offer 5:** Offer Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]. I keep [5, 7, 2, 3, 5] for myself. My value would be (5 * 94) + (7 * 80) + (2 * 86) + (3 * 11) + (5 * 85) = 470 + 560 + 172 + 33 + 425 = 1660. 1660 * 0.9 = 1494. Still lower.\n\n    * **Important Note:** Since this is round 2, if I don't accept or walk, Player 2 gets to make a counteroffer in round 3, and if they do it will trigger a walk, so I have to ensure I get the most value out of this round. \n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n    *   Accepting is not an option.\n    *   If I walk, my value is 1676.\n    *   It appears any offer I make to Player 2 that gives them items, will lower my value below my outside offer, even with the discount factor.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1757. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 987 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [8, 0, 0, 8, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 8 + 32 x 0 + 51 x 0 + 89 x 8 + 73 x 5\n    which is 1749 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1757. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best course of action for Player 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 1757.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 84\n    *   Item 2: 32\n    *   Item 3: 51\n    *   Item 4: 89\n    *   Item 5: 73\n*   **Total items:**\n    *   Item 1: 8 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 8 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*   **Discount factor:** Gamma = 0.9.

An equal division is not possible due to different number of units per item.\n    *   Instead, let's try to make a relatively even value division.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [8, 0, 0, 8, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 8 + 32 x 0 + 51 x 0 + 89 x 8 + 73 x 5\n    which is 1749 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1757. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best course of action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1757\n*   **My item values:** \n    *   Item 1: 84\n    *   Item 2: 32\n    *   Item 3: 51\n    *   Item 4: 89\n    *   Item 5: 73\n*   **Total items:** 8 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 8 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the items, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 times the value of the items.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5. The value of this offer to me is 1 * 84 + 0 * 32 + 0 * 51 + 0 * 89 + 0 * 73 = 84. Since this is round 2, I need to multiply it by 0.9, meaning this offer is worth 84 * 0.9 = 75.6 to me.\n    This is far less than my outside offer of 1757, and will therefore result in an overall loss to me.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that has a value greater than 1757 * 0.9 = 1581.3 once discounted. Let's consider keeping most of the items for myself and offering the minimum to player 2, like last time. For example, if I offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] to the other player and keep [7, 2, 1, 8, 5] for myself:\n    *   7 * 84 + 2 * 32 + 1 * 51 + 8 * 89 + 5 * 73 = 588 + 64 + 51 + 712 + 365 = 1780\n    *   The value of this offer, in round 2, is 1780 * 0.9 = 1602\n    *   This is greater than my discounted outside offer value, but let's try to create a better offer, if possible.\n    If I offer the other player [0,0,0,0,0], I keep everything: 8 * 84 + 2 * 32 + 1 * 51 + 8 * 89 + 5 * 73 = 672 + 64 + 51 + 712 + 365 = 1864\n    This would be worth 1864 * 0.9 = 1677.6, higher than my discounted outside offer value.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible, worth 75.6, compared to my outside option worth 1757 * 0.9 = 1581.3 once discounted.\n*   Accepting is mistake #4, accepting a worse deal than my outside option.\n*   Walking away now means I get my outside offer, at 1757, which when discounted to round two is 1581.3. \n*   I can propose a counter offer that gives me a value greater than 1581.3. I calculated an offer of [0,0,0,0,0] for the other player, that provides me a value of 1677.6 in round two.\n*   Therefore, I should make a counteroffer that is advantageous to me.\n\n**Final Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This means I would receive:\n    *   4 units of item 1: 4 * 84 = 336\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 32 = 32\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 51 = 51\n    *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 89 = 356\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 73 = 219\n    *   **Total value of current offer:** 336 + 32 + 51 + 356 + 219 = 994\n    *   **Discounted value of current offer:** 994 * 0.81 = 805.14\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is worth 1757, which is much better than the discounted value of accepting the current offer (805.14) . Accepting the current offer is a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since this is the final round and I cannot make an actual offer, there is no point to calculating the worth of different counter offers. I will make the best possible offer in terms of keeping the most value to me.\n\n    If I were to offer [0,0,0,0,0] I would keep [8, 2, 1, 8, 5]\n    Value = (8*84) + (2*32) + (1*51) + (8*89) + (5*73) = 672 + 64 + 51 + 712 + 365 = 1864.\n    This value is better than my outside offer of 1757.\n    So this is a valid counteroffer, however since it is the final round, this will be counted as a walk.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince the discounted value of the current offer (805.14) is less than my outside offer (1757), I should not accept it. Since this is the final round, a counteroffer is treated as a walk, so I will walk away.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 3, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 1 + 18 x 0 + 50 x 3 + 66 x 5 + 78 x 0\n    which is 579 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 580. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

I need to consider offers that will be better than my outside option. \n    I want to offer something that is attractive to the other player, but maximizes my own value.\n    Let me first calculate my total value of all items, which is:\n    99 * 1 + 18 * 8 + 50 * 4 + 66 * 5 + 78 * 6 = 99 + 144 + 200 + 330 + 468 = 1241\n\nI will make an initial counteroffer that tries to get as much of the valuable items as possible, while still making sure the other player gets something decent that they could accept.

I should also not walk away since I have not made an offer yet and can make an offer that is much more than my outside offer.\nI will make the counteroffer as calculated above to the other player.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 3, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 1 + 18 x 0 + 50 x 3 + 66 x 5 + 78 x 0\n    which is 579 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 580. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that the value of an agreement in later rounds is reduced.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 7, 1, 1, 0]. This means I would keep [7, 0, 2, 1, 8]. My value for this offer is:\n    (7 * 98) + (0 * 28) + (2 * 98) + (1 * 43) + (8 * 25) = 686 + 0 + 196 + 43 + 200 = 1125\n    This offer, worth 1125, is less than my outside offer of 1382.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to calculate what I would get by making a counteroffer and compare it to my outside offer. Since we are in round 1, there's no point accepting a bad offer and I should propose something beneficial for me. I will try keeping most of the items and offering as little as possible to Player 1, while still being reasonable.  I must keep in mind I want to aim for a value above 1382. Let's try offering the other player the following offer [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This means I keep [6, 6, 3, 2, 7].

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 8, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 0 + 57 x 1 + 36 x 3 + 30 x 8 + 22 x 3\n    which is 471 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 472. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's try giving Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] in round 1, and keeping the rest (meaning that I would offer [2,4,3,9,4] to the other player).\n        Value = (2*49)+(4*57)+(3*36)+(9*30)+(4*22) = 98 + 228 + 108 + 270 + 88 = 792\n        This offer is not a good counteroffer, as it keeps the total pool of items for myself, which is very greedy and will likely lead to the other player walking away\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1 [0, 1, 1, 3, 1].\n        This means I would keep [2-0, 4-1, 3-1, 9-3, 4-1] = [2, 3, 2, 6, 3]\n        Value = (2 * 49) + (3 * 57) + (2 * 36) + (6 * 30) + (3 * 22) = 98 + 171 + 72 + 180 + 66 = 587\n        587 > 472: This offer is also better than the outside offer. \n\n    Let's try offering Player 1 [0,1,0,3,0].\n        This means I would keep [2-0, 4-1, 3-0, 9-3, 4-0] = [2,3,3,6,4]\n        Value = (2*49)+(3*57)+(3*36)+(6*30)+(4*22) = 98 + 171+108+180+88 = 645\n        645 > 472, this offer also would be beneficial.\n        Let's try an offer giving more of the lower-value items away.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1 [1, 2, 1, 4, 2].\n        This means I would keep [2-1, 4-2, 3-1, 9-4, 4-2] = [1, 2, 2, 5, 2]\n        Value = (1 * 49) + (2 * 57) + (2 * 36) + (5 * 30) + (2 * 22) = 49 + 114 + 72 + 150 + 44 = 429\n        429 < 472: This is a bad offer, worse than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1 [0,1,1,4,1]\n        This means I would keep [2-0, 4-1, 3-1, 9-4, 4-1] = [2, 3, 2, 5, 3]\n        Value = (2*49)+(3*57)+(2*36)+(5*30)+(3*22) = 98 + 171 + 72 + 150 + 66 = 557\n        557 > 472: This offer is also better than my outside offer.\n\n    The current offer is worth 538 to me. I need to offer a counteroffer that is strategically valuable (not offering everything or nothing) and worth more than my outside offer value. I want to improve my current position. Offering [0, 1, 1, 4, 1] to the opponent while keeping [2, 3, 2, 5, 3] seems like a reasonable approach to me, since it keeps the value of the items I keep above my outside offer value and still leaves the other player with some items.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 538, which is greater than my outside offer of 472. However, I should try to improve my position by making a counteroffer that is also worth more than my outside option.\n\nI will make a counteroffer where I propose to give Player 1 [0, 1, 1, 4, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 4, 1]}\n```\n",

This means that a deal made in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the deal (relative to a round 1 deal)\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 1, 1, 4, 1].

My first offer was [1, 1, 1, 3, 1] for Player 2, and Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 4, 1] to me. Now I have the chance to accept 497.7 or counteroffer. Offer 1 was only for 333.9, offer 3 was 421.2.\nI think I should try to get a better deal for myself. Let's create a counteroffer with higher value than offer 3 but lower value than what I currently have.\n*   **Offer 4:** [0, 1, 0, 3, 1]. This means I keep [2, 3, 3, 6, 3]\n   * 2*10 = 20\n    * 3*30 = 90\n    * 3*39 = 117\n    * 6*28 = 168\n    * 3*75 = 225\n    * Total = 620. 620*0.9 = 558.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 497.7 (after discounting) which is much better than my outside offer, and better than offer 1 and 3.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 195. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 546 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 30 x 2 + 39 x 2 + 28 x 2 + 75 x 0\n    which is 194 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 195. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 638\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 1, Item 2: 87, Item 3: 76, Item 4: 83, Item 5: 57\n*   **Total pool of items:** 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that if the negotiation continues to the second round, the value of any accepted offer will be multiplied by 0.9, and the value of a deal accepted in round 3 will be multiplied by 0.81, compared to an immediate offer.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an initial offer to Player 2. Since I want to maximize my outcome, I should keep as much as I can while making it attractive enough for player 2 to consider it and prevent an immediate walk. Let's start by calculating the value of keeping different portions of the items to determine a suitable counter offer.\n\n   *  Let's try offering half of each item to the opponent, this would be giving 2 items of type 1, 2 of type 2, 1 of type 3, 2 of type 4 and 1 of type 5. This would leave me with 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 1 of item 5. My value would be:\n        2 * 1 + 2 * 87 + 1 * 76 + 2 * 83 + 1 * 57 = 2 + 174 + 76 + 166 + 57 = 475. This is too low compared to my outside offer value of 638.\n  \n   * Let's try offering 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 0 of item 5. This leaves me with 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 2 of item 5. This gives me a value of:\n        3 * 1 + 3 * 87 + 2 * 76 + 3 * 83 + 2 * 57 = 3 + 261 + 152 + 249 + 114 = 779. This is greater than 638, my outside offer.\n\n   * Let's try offering only 1 of item 2 to the opponent. This leaves me with 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4 and 2 of item 5. This gives me a value of: \n     4*1 + 3*87 + 2*76 + 4*83 + 2*57 = 4 + 261 + 152 + 332 + 114 = 865. This is even better for me, so this is what I will use for my counteroffer.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\n*   Since there is no current offer, and my outside offer is only my fallback option, I should propose a counteroffer. I can offer 1 unit of item 2 to player 2, which leaves me with 4 item 1s, 3 item 2s, 2 item 3s, 4 item 4s, and 2 item 5s. This gives me a total value of 865, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 124. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 124. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 537 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 16 x 2 + 15 x 1 + 38 x 2\n    which is 123 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 124. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I will start by considering an even split of the items where each player takes approximately half.\n    I have to offer Player 2 a whole number for each item, if an item cannot be evenly split, then one player may have 1 additional item.\n\n    Let's consider giving Player 2:\n    Item 1: 1\n    Item 2: 2\n    Item 3: 2\n    Item 4: 2\n    Item 5: 2\n     This means I keep the rest, which is:\n    Item 1: 2\n    Item 2: 2\n    Item 3: 3\n    Item 4: 2\n    Item 5: 3\n\n    My value for what I keep:\n    (2 * 53) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 97) + (2 * 59) + (3 * 25) = 106 + 12 + 291 + 118 + 75 = 602\n    602 is greater than my outside offer of 22.\n    This split appears to be a valid start.\n\n    Let's consider giving player 2:\n    Item 1: 0\n    Item 2: 0\n    Item 3: 0\n    Item 4: 0\n    Item 5: 0\n\n    Then I keep:\n    Item 1: 3\n    Item 2: 4\n    Item 3: 5\n    Item 4: 4\n    Item 5: 5\n    My value for this is:\n     (3 * 53) + (4 * 6) + (5 * 97) + (4 * 59) + (5 * 25) = 159 + 24 + 485 + 236 + 125 = 1029\n    This is an option, but not the most strategic for initiating negotiations.\n\n    Let's try giving the other player more:\n    Item 1: 2\n    Item 2: 2\n    Item 3: 3\n    Item 4: 2\n    Item 5: 3\n\n    Then I keep:\n    Item 1: 1\n    Item 2: 2\n    Item 3: 2\n    Item 4: 2\n    Item 5: 2\n    My value for this is:\n    (1 * 53) + (2 * 6) + (2 * 97) + (2 * 59) + (2 * 25) = 53 + 12 + 194 + 118 + 50 = 427\n    427 is greater than my outside offer of 22.\n\n    I am trying to create an opening offer and will attempt to acquire the most items that I can. I will give Player 2 what seems like a fair amount of items and keep the rest, given that I am Player 1.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer, attempting to secure the most value for myself whilst appearing reasonable. I will offer Player 2:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 2\nWhich will keep the rest for me.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 112. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1191 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 2 + 98 x 0 + 79 x 0 + 76 x 0 + 91 x 0\n    which is 106 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 112. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and make a decision.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 112\n*   **My item values:** \n    *   Item 1: 53\n    *   Item 2: 98\n    *   Item 3: 79\n    *   Item 4: 76\n    *   Item 5: 91\n*   **Total pool of items:** 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an agreement in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an agreement in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its face value. Since this is round 1, this doesn't affect the offer itself yet.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offered me [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 53 = 53\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 98 = 196\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 79 = 158\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 76 = 152\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 91 = 182\n    *   **Total value of current offer:** 53 + 196 + 158 + 152 + 182 = 741\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 741 > 112.  The current offer is much better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would want if I don't accept the current offer. Since the current offer is good, I want to make sure that my counteroffer gives me more than 112. \n    Let's consider keeping the following numbers of items: [2, 2, 3, 2, 3]. Then player 1 gets the rest. \n    This counteroffer would give me:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 53 = 106\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 98 = 196\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 79 = 237\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 76 = 152\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 91 = 273\n    *   Total value: 106 + 196 + 237 + 152 + 273 = 964\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 741 to me, which is far better than my outside offer of 112.\n*   I have calculated a potential counteroffer that would give me a value of 964, which is also better than my outside offer, and significantly better than the current offer.\n*   Since this is the first round and the current offer is good, it might be beneficial to attempt to get a better offer before I accept it.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer. The offer to Player 1 should be the complement of what I keep, which was [2,2,3,2,3]. Therefore the offer is [1,2,2,2,2].\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 112. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1191 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 2 + 98 x 0 + 79 x 0 + 76 x 0 + 91 x 0\n    which is 106 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 112. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 112.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 53\n    *   Item 2: 98\n    *   Item 3: 79\n    *   Item 4: 76\n    *   Item 5: 91\n*   **Total Items:** There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. Since this is round 2, any deal made this round will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. Any deal in the next round will be multiplied by 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would keep [3, 3, 4, 3, 4]. My value for this offer is:\n    *   Item 1: 3 * 53 = 159\n    *   Item 2: 3 * 98 = 294\n    *   Item 3: 4 * 79 = 316\n    *   Item 4: 3 * 76 = 228\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 91 = 364\n    *   Total value: 159 + 294 + 316 + 228 + 364 = 1361\n    *   Discounted value: 1361 * 0.9 = 1224.9\n    *   Since 1224.9 > 112, accepting the current offer is better than my outside option.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    * I need to compare to my outside offer of 112. I want to make an offer that is better than 112 * 0.9 and is better than my current offer. I'm thinking about if we are going to round 3, the best I can get at that round is 1705*0.81=1381.05. The current offer is 1224.9. Since I have a large negotiation value I should try to propose an offer that gives me more. I do not want to make an offer worse than my current offer. \n    * Let's consider an offer where Player 1 receives half of the items of each type rounded down. This would be [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]. Thus, I will keep [2, 2, 3, 2, 3]. My value for this offer would be:\n    *   Item 1: 2 * 53 = 106\n    *   Item 2: 2 * 98 = 196\n    *   Item 3: 3 * 79 = 237\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 76 = 152\n    *   Item 5: 3 * 91 = 273\n    *   Total value: 106 + 196 + 237 + 152 + 273 = 964\n    *   Discounted Value : 964 * 0.9 = 867.6. Since this is less than my current offer and more than my outside offer, this is a reasonable counteroffer\n    * I am going to offer [1,1,1,1,1] to player 1. This means I will get [2,3,4,3,4]\n        * Item 1: 2 * 53 = 106\n        * Item 2: 3 * 98 = 294\n        * Item 3: 4 * 79 = 316\n        * Item 4: 3 * 76 = 228\n        * Item 5: 4 * 91 = 364\n        * Total: 106 + 294 + 316 + 228 + 364 = 1308.\n        * Discounted Value : 1308 * 0.9 = 1177.2\n        \n        This is better than my outside option but worse than my current offer.\n\n    *   Let's try an offer of [0, 0, 1, 1, 1].\n        This means I will get [3, 4, 4, 3, 4]. My value is:\n         * Item 1: 3 * 53 = 159\n         * Item 2: 4 * 98 = 392\n         * Item 3: 4 * 79 = 316\n         * Item 4: 3 * 76 = 228\n         * Item 5: 4 * 91 = 364\n        *   Total value: 159 + 392 + 316 + 228 + 364 = 1459\n         * Discounted Value: 1459 * 0.9 = 1313.1\n         \n         This is better than accepting the current offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 1224.9, which is better than my outside offer of 112. However, I calculated a counteroffer of [0, 0, 1, 1, 1] that gives me a total discounted value of 1313.1, which is also better than my outside offer and the current offer. I should make this offer since it is better than my current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 12 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 23 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 97 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 80 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 62 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:** 3 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. The value of any deal we reach in later rounds is decreased by this discount.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since this is the first round, I can propose a counteroffer and keep the rest. It's important to make sure that my offer is higher than 267 to avoid mistake 2. I will start by making an even split offer and then iterate.\n    -Offer the other player half of the items (rounded up), which is [2, 4, 3, 2, 1] to player 2. My keep would be [1, 3, 3, 1, 1]. My value for this keep is:\n    (1 * 12) + (3 * 23) + (3 * 97) + (1 * 80) + (1 * 62) = 12 + 69 + 291 + 80 + 62 = 514. This is better than my outside offer of 267.\n    - Offer the other player [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]. My keep is [2, 5, 4, 2, 1]. My value for this is:\n     (2 * 12) + (5 * 23) + (4 * 97) + (2 * 80) + (1 * 62) = 24 + 115 + 388 + 160 + 62 = 749.\n    - Offer the other player [0,0,0,0,0]. This keeps everything for me which is:\n    (3*12)+(7*23)+(6*97)+(3*80)+(2*62) = 36 + 161 + 582 + 240 + 124 = 1143. This is my maximum value.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer, as there is none.\n*   I should not walk away, as I have not yet proposed an offer.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer value.\n\nI will propose an offer that is favorable but not extreme, keeping the most valuable items for myself.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 94. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 309 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

This would offer Player 1 [1, 2, 2, 1, 1], which is exactly what they offered to me, so I know this is not a good counter offer (it has the exact same value for me as what is currently being offered)\n    * If I keep [3, 7, 6, 3, 2], the value to me would be: 3*26 + 7*21 + 6*4 + 3*12 + 2*40 = 78 + 147 + 24 + 36 + 80 = 365.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 94. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 309 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 0 + 21 x 1 + 4 x 2 + 12 x 2 + 40 x 1\n    which is 93 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 94. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 94\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 26\n    *   Item 2: 21\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 12\n    *   Item 5: 40\n*   **Total items:** 3 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]. This means I receive:\n    *   3 - 0 = 3 units of item 1\n    *   7 - 2 = 5 units of item 2\n    *   6 - 1 = 5 units of item 3\n    *   3 - 0 = 3 units of item 4\n    *   2 - 0 = 2 units of item 5\n    My value for accepting this offer is: (3 * 26) + (5 * 21) + (5 * 4) + (3 * 12) + (2 * 40) = 78 + 105 + 20 + 36 + 80 = 319\n    Adjusted for the discount factor, the present value of this offer is 319 * 0.9 = 287.1\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I will start by calculating how much value I get if I keep the most items for myself and offer as little as possible to the other party, as a starting point:\n    I keep: [3, 5, 5, 3, 2]\n    Player 1 gets: [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]\n    My value: 319\n\n    Let's try a different counteroffer. If I give player 1 an equal share on each item (if possible), this means:\n    I keep: [2,4,3,2,1]\n    Player 1 gets: [1,3,3,1,1]\n    My value: 2*26 + 4*21 + 3*4 + 2*12 + 1*40 = 52+84+12+24+40 = 212\n\n    Let's consider an offer of me giving [1, 3, 2, 1, 1] to the other party. This means I keep:\n    [2, 4, 4, 2, 1] which has a value of\n    (2 * 26) + (4 * 21) + (4 * 4) + (2 * 12) + (1 * 40) = 52 + 84 + 16 + 24 + 40 = 216\n    216 * 0.9 = 194.4. This is still better than my outside offer of 94.\n  \n    Let's try a better offer for me, and a smaller offer for Player 1, like [0,1,1,0,0]\n        This means I get:\n        [3,6,5,3,2]\n        This has a value of:\n        (3 * 26) + (6 * 21) + (5 * 4) + (3 * 12) + (2 * 40) = 78 + 126 + 20 + 36 + 80 = 340\n    340*0.9 = 306\n\n* **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer of 287.1 is much greater than my outside offer of 94. My calculated counteroffers are also much better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is very good for me (much better than my outside offer) and I should accept.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 90 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 22 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 40 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 71 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 69 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times the undiscounted value and a deal in round 3 will be worth 0.81 times the undiscounted value. Therefore, there is an incentive to reach a deal early.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer that is better than my outside offer of 69. I should start by thinking about what a fair split might be, and then offer something close to that but still beneficial for myself.\n    *   A 50/50 split is not always the optimal strategy, especially with the information asymmetry given our different item values. A 50/50 split in terms of the number of items doesn't make sense, but a 50/50 split in terms of total value might be a place to start. However, given we want to maximize our own value, we may want to offer something slightly less.\n    *   Let's start by considering a counteroffer where I give the other player 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5. The number of items I would keep would be 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5. The total value of this offer to me would be 1 * 90 + 2 * 22 + 2 * 40 + 3 * 71 + 2 * 69 = 90 + 44 + 80 + 213 + 138 = 565\n    * Let's try a counteroffer where I give the other player 0 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5. The number of items I would keep would be 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 4 of item 5. The total value of this offer to me would be 2 * 90 + 3 * 22 + 4 * 40 + 4 * 71 + 4 * 69 = 180 + 66 + 160 + 284 + 276 = 966\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is none, so I can't accept.\n*   Walking away would give me only 69.\n*   Therefore I should make a counteroffer. Since the second offer I calculated gives me a very high value of 966, this is a good start. I also am not going to make the mistake of offering nothing to the opponent.

Your value would be:\n    82 x 2 + 68 x 1 + 91 x 4 + 79 x 2 + 57 x 4\n    which is 982 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 986. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 986. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 82\n    *   Item 2: 68\n    *   Item 3: 91\n    *   Item 4: 79\n    *   Item 5: 57\n*   **Total Pool of Items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means that the value of any deal is multiplied by 0.9^(r-1) where r is the round number. This means a deal in later rounds is less valuable.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me \\[0, 0, 0, 1, 0].  This means they are giving me 1 unit of Item 4.\n    *   My value for receiving 1 unit of item 4 is 1 * 79 = 79\n    *   Since this is round 1 the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1\n    *   The value is therefore 79.\n    *   This is less than my outside offer of 986 so this offer is not good.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to create a counteroffer where what I keep is worth more than 986 and it is not too extreme.\n    * If I keep all the items, my total value is: 2 * 82 + 3 * 68 + 4 * 91 + 5 * 79 + 4 * 57 = 164 + 204 + 364 + 395 + 228 = 1355. Since this is better than the offer I will start with this as a baseline for constructing a counteroffer.\n   * I will try offering 1 unit each of item 1, item 2, item 3 and item 5 to Player 1.\n        *   My value for keeping [1, 2, 3, 5, 3]: 1 * 82 + 2 * 68 + 3 * 91 + 5 * 79 + 3 * 57 = 82 + 136 + 273 + 395 + 171 = 1057.\n        *   Since 1057 > 986, this offer is better than my outside option. This seems like a reasonable offer, not too greedy.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is not acceptable as it is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n*   My counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] would give me a value of 1057 which is better than my outside offer of 986.\n* I will therefore make the counter offer [1,1,1,0,1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

The offer must be better than my outside offer value multiplied by the discount factor, 986*0.9 = 887.4.\n\n    Let's consider keeping most of items and offering only 1 of item 1, item 2, item 3 and item 5 (we will offer 0 units of item 4 since it is more valuable).\n    My keep: [1, 2, 3, 5, 3]\n    Value: 82 * 1 + 68 * 2 + 91 * 3 + 79 * 5 + 57 * 3 = 82 + 136 + 273 + 395 + 171 = 1057\n    Discounted Value: 1057 * 0.9 = 951.3\n    This is greater than my discounted outside offer value, therefore, this is a valid counteroffer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 339.3, which is less than my discounted outside offer of 887.4. Accepting the offer would be a mistake.\n\nI have now identified a counteroffer which is worth 951.3 which is greater than my discounted outside offer of 887.4. Therefore, I should propose a counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 0, 1], where this is what I am offering to Player 1.\n\nTherefore my action is to make a counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 0, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    90 x 0 + 22 x 3 + 40 x 0 + 71 x 0 + 69 x 0\n    which is 66 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 69. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Since this is round 3, the discount factor will be (0.9)^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81. The value of the negotiation outcome is therefore multiplied by 0.81. This does not affect the decision of whether to accept or not an offer, but it does affect the overall value if a deal is reached.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 1].\n    *   My value for this offer: (1 * 90) + (1 * 22) + (1 * 40) + (0 * 71) + (1 * 69) = 221.\n    *   The discounted value is 221 * 0.81 = 179.01\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The value of the current offer, 179.01, is much higher than my outside offer of 69.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since this is the last round, if I were to make a counteroffer, this would be considered as a WALK. So, the choice is between accepting and walking away.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is much better than my outside offer (179.01 > 69).

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 0 + 53 x 0 + 37 x 0 + 71 x 0 + 13 x 2\n    which is 26 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 33. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 33.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 53\n    *   Item 2: 53\n    *   Item 3: 37\n    *   Item 4: 71\n    *   Item 5: 13\n*   **Total items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6\n    *   Item 2: 1\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 4\n    *   Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less than offers in earlier rounds. Accepting an offer now is worth more than accepting an identical offer in the future, by a factor of 0.9 per round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 0, 2, 2, 1].\n    *   My value for this offer: (3 * 53) + (0 * 53) + (2 * 37) + (2 * 71) + (1 * 13) = 159 + 0 + 74 + 142 + 13 = 388\n    * Since this is round 1 there is no discount to apply.\n*  **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer of 388 is much better than my outside offer of 33.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n   I need to think about counteroffers that are better for me, but not so greedy that Player 1 will walk away. I will calculate the value of several possible counteroffers before deciding.\n\n    * **Counteroffer 1:** I keep [3, 1, 2, 2, 2] and offer [3, 0, 2, 2, 1] to Player 1 (same as current offer, just flipped, which I will do if my offer is worse).\n    * My Value: (3 * 53) + (1 * 53) + (2 * 37) + (2 * 71) + (2 * 13) = 159 + 53 + 74 + 142 + 26 = 454\n    *  **Counteroffer 2:** I keep [4, 0, 3, 3, 2] and offer [2, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1.\n      * My Value: (4 * 53) + (0 * 53) + (3 * 37) + (3 * 71) + (2 * 13) = 212 + 0 + 111 + 213 + 26 = 562\n    * **Counteroffer 3:** I keep [5, 1, 3, 3, 2] and offer [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1.\n      * My Value: (5 * 53) + (1 * 53) + (3 * 37) + (3 * 71) + (2 * 13) = 265 + 53 + 111 + 213 + 26 = 668\n    *   **Counteroffer 4:** I keep [6, 1, 4, 4, 3] and offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1\n        * My Value: (6 * 53) + (1 * 53) + (4 * 37) + (4 * 71) + (3 * 13) = 318 + 53 + 148 + 284 + 39 = 842\n         \n*    I will not offer counteroffer 4 as this will likely be rejected.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of [3, 0, 2, 2, 1] has a value of 388 to me, which is much greater than my outside option.  So accepting would not be a mistake, however I could probably get a better deal.\n*   My most advantageous counteroffer seems to be to keep [5, 1, 3, 3, 2], which is worth 668 to me.

Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep all the items.\n    *   My value: (6 * 53) + (1 * 53) + (4 * 37) + (4 * 71) + (3 * 13) = 318 + 53 + 148 + 284 + 39 = 842.\n    *   Since the current offer is made in round 2, we must discount this by 0.9. So, discounted value for me is: 842 * 0.9 = 757.8\n    *   This is much better than my outside offer of 33.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Before considering, I need to understand what I want to accomplish. I want to make an offer that I value more than my outside offer, and Player 1 might find acceptable, or at least not worse than their outside offer.\n\n    *   **Consider keeping [3, 1, 2, 2, 2] for myself, and offering the rest to Player 1:**\n        *   My value: (3 * 53) + (1 * 53) + (2 * 37) + (2 * 71) + (2 * 13) = 159 + 53 + 74 + 142 + 26 = 454\n        *   Discounted value: 454 * 0.9 = 408.6\n        *   This is much better than 33, and leaves Player 1 with [3, 0, 2, 2, 1]\n\n   *   **Consider keeping [4, 0, 2, 2, 2] for myself, and offering the rest to Player 1:**\n        *   My value: (4 * 53) + (0 * 53) + (2 * 37) + (2 * 71) + (2 * 13) = 212 + 0 + 74 + 142 + 26 = 454\n        *   Discounted value: 454 * 0.9 = 408.6\n        *  This is also much better than 33, and leaves Player 1 with [2, 1, 2, 2, 1]\n    \n     *   **Consider keeping [5, 1, 3, 3, 2] for myself, and offering the rest to Player 1:**\n        *  My value: (5 * 53) + (1 * 53) + (3 * 37) + (3 * 71) + (2 * 13) = 265 + 53 + 111 + 213 + 26 = 668\n        *   Discounted value: 668 * 0.9 = 601.2\n        *   This is better than 33, and leaves Player 1 with [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 757.8, which is much greater than my outside offer of 33.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 522. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 522. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 645 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 8, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 56 x 1 + 54 x 0 + 58 x 8 + 45 x 0\n    which is 520 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 522. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 522\n*   **My values per item:**\n    *   Item 1: 2\n    *   Item 2: 56\n    *   Item 3: 54\n    *   Item 4: 58\n    *   Item 5: 45\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 1\n    *   Item 3: 2\n    *   Item 4: 8\n    *   Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. In round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.  This means there is no discount yet, as we are in the first round. This will matter in future rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to determine what offer to propose. My goal is to make an offer that gives me a value higher than my outside offer (522) while hopefully being appealing enough to player 2 to accept. Let's evaluate a few possibilities:\n    *   **Keeping everything:** 3*2 + 1*56 + 2*54 + 8*58 + 3*45 = 6 + 56 + 108 + 464 + 135 = 769. This is the maximum possible value I could get and much better than my outside offer, but will be rejected.\n    *   **Giving away all items:** My value would be 0, which is obviously worse than my outside offer. \n    *    **Giving half of each item** (rounded down where necessary, remember only item 2 and 3 have an even number of units): Offer [1, 0, 1, 4, 1] to Player 2, keeping [2, 1, 1, 4, 2]. My value would be 2*2 + 1*56 + 1*54 + 4*58 + 2*45 = 4 + 56 + 54 + 232 + 90 = 436. This is below my outside offer.\n    *   **Give away only items with lower values:** Lets try to give away some of item 1 and item 5, keeping the rest. Lets offer [1,0,0,0,1]. This means I would keep [2,1,2,8,2]. My value is 2*2 + 1*56 + 2*54 + 8*58 + 2*45 = 4+56+108+464+90= 722. Still high, but less than keeping everything.\n\n    Let's try an offer that aims to get us near our outside offer.\n    *   If I offer [0,0,0,4,0] to player 2. Then I keep [3,1,2,4,3]. My value: 3*2 + 1*56 + 2*54 + 4*58 + 3*45 = 6+56+108+232+135 = 537. This is better than 522, my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept, because there is no current offer.\n*   I should not walk away, as there's the potential to get a better deal than my outside offer.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer. I will offer [0, 0, 0, 4, 0] to Player 2. This leaves me with [3, 1, 2, 4, 3], with a value of 537 which is better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 8, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 56 x 1 + 54 x 0 + 58 x 8 + 45 x 0\n    which is 520 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 522. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 522\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 2, Item 2: 56, Item 3: 54, Item 4: 58, Item 5: 45\n*   **Total items:** 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n*  **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal accepted in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times what it would be worth in round 1\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer on the table is that I receive [0, 0, 0, 8, 0] (the number of items I receive, not what I give away).  This means I keep all units of Item 4. The value of this offer to me is:\n    (0 * 2) + (0 * 56) + (0 * 54) + (8 * 58) + (0 * 45) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 464 + 0 = 464.  My discounted value of accepting this offer at round 2 is 464 * 0.9 = 417.6. Since this value (417.6) is lower than my outside offer (522), I should not accept it.\n    \n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to create a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. I need to keep enough items such that when multiplied by their unit value the sum is greater than 522. Note: this must be true before the discount factor is applied.\n\n    Let's consider a few options, keeping in mind that I want to maximize my profit.\n    * Option 1: I keep all items 1, 2, 3 and 5 and 4 units of item 4. Give Player 2 4 units of item 4. My value: (3 * 2) + (1 * 56) + (2 * 54) + (4 * 58) + (3 * 45) = 6 + 56 + 108 + 232 + 135 = 537.  This has a value to me of 537, which is greater than my outside offer of 522.\n    * Option 2: I keep all of items 1, 2, 3, and 5 and 0 units of item 4. Give Player 2 all 8 units of item 4. My value is 6 + 56 + 108 + 0 + 135 = 305. This is lower than my outside offer, so I won't propose it.\n   *  Option 3:  I keep all items except 4, keep 2 units of item 4. Give Player 2 6 units of item 4. My value:  6 + 56 + 108 + 2 * 58 + 135 = 6 + 56 + 108 + 116 + 135 = 421. Too low, not viable.\n\n    Given these, I will select Option 1 as it has a total value to me (537) that exceeds my outside offer (522). Since Player 2 would receive 4 units of item 4, the counter offer will be [0, 0, 0, 4, 0].\n    \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0, 0, 0, 8, 0] is worth 417.6 to me in round 2, which is lower than my outside offer of 522.  I should not accept this.\n*   I will make the counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 4, 0] because this results in a payoff of 537 which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 8, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 56 x 1 + 54 x 0 + 58 x 8 + 45 x 0\n    which is 520 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 522. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that if the negotiation continues to later rounds, the value of any final agreement will be reduced by a power of 0.9, making deals in earlier rounds more valuable.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me \\[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means they are giving me 1 unit of item 1, and keeping the rest.\n\n    *   My value if I accept this offer: 1 * 94 = 94. This is far less than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep most of what is valuable to me and give most of the less valuable items. A good starting point would be to keep all units of item 5 and most of item 1 and 4. I will also attempt to keep units of the least valuable items. Let's test keeping: \\[5, 2, 1, 4, 1].\n\n    *   My value for keeping \\[5, 2, 1, 4, 1]:  5 * 94 + 2 * 3 + 1 * 1 + 4 * 33 + 1 * 97 = 470 + 6 + 1 + 132 + 97 = 706\n\n    *   This is a value greater than my outside offer of 385, so I should propose this.

I have 2 of item 3, so I give away 2-1 = 1 of those. I have 8 of item 4, so I give away 8-4 = 4 of those. I have 1 of item 5, so I give away 1 - 1 = 0 of those. This gives a counteroffer of [2, 1, 1, 4, 0].\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of \\[1, 0, 0, 0, 0] has a value of only 94 to me, which is far less than my outside offer of 385, so I should not ACCEPT.\n\n*   I should not WALK away yet because I can make a counter offer that is beneficial for me. I can try to obtain more of the items which are valuable to me.\n*   My counteroffer has a value of 706, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer of \\[2, 1, 1, 4, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 4, 0]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1043. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 780 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 3, 2, 7, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 7 + 14 x 3 + 70 x 2 + 77 x 7 + 62 x 1\n    which is 1042 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1043. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This would mean I keep [4,1,0,4,0]\n\n* Value of keeping (4 * 37) + (1 * 14) + (0 * 70) + (4 * 77) + (0 * 62) = 148 + 14 + 0 + 308 + 0 = 470.\n    * This is way below my outside offer.\n\nLet's try giving [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] meaning I would keep [6, 2, 1, 7, 1]\n    * Value of keeping (6*37) + (2*14) + (1*70) + (7*77) + (1*62) = 222 + 28 + 70 + 539 + 62 = 921\n    * 921 < 1043, still bad.\n    \nLet's try giving [1,0,0,0,0] like my first offer. I would then keep [6,3,2,8,1]\n    * Value of keeping = (6*37)+(3*14)+(2*70)+(8*77)+(1*62) = 222+42+140+616+62 = 1082\n    * This is better than my outside offer, so this is a better starting point.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1043. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 780 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 3, 2, 7, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 7 + 14 x 3 + 70 x 2 + 77 x 7 + 62 x 1\n    which is 1042 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1043. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 4, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1043\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 37, Item 2: 14, Item 3: 70, Item 4: 77, Item 5: 62\n*   **Total items:** 7 of Item 1, 3 of Item 2, 2 of Item 3, 8 of Item 4, 1 of Item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get to keep all the items.\n    *   My value for keeping all items is: (7 * 37) + (3 * 14) + (2 * 70) + (8 * 77) + (1 * 62) = 259 + 42 + 140 + 616 + 62 = 1119\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 1119 * 0.81 = 906.39\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to make sure my counteroffer is better than my outside offer given this is the last round, otherwise I should just accept the offer given to me currently of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n    Let's calculate the value of some counteroffers. If I offer player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], my value would be:\n     (6 * 37) + (2 * 14) + (1 * 70) + (7 * 77) + (0 * 62) = 222+28+70+539+0 = 859.\n     Discounted value = 859 * 0.81 = 695.79. This is less than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's say I offer player 2 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], my value would be:\n    (6 * 37) + (3 * 14) + (2 * 70) + (8 * 77) + (1 * 62) = 222 + 42 + 140 + 616 + 62 = 1082.\n    Discounted Value = 1082 * 0.81 = 876.42 This is less than my outside offer.\n\n    Since this is the last round, any counteroffer will be interpreted as a walk.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The value of keeping all items (1119) * 0.81 (906.39)  is less than my outside offer of 1043. However, I get all the items if I accept the offer. The discount on round 3 is 0.81, and this is the only way to obtain the items. I should accept the offer since my value of the current offer is better than my outside offer even with the discount. \n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is worth 906.39 to me. I should accept as any counteroffer would be a walk.\n* Since this is the last round, I can not make a counteroffer because it would mean a walk.\n\n**Action:**\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1 in this first round.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 112. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 73\n    *   Item 2: 90\n    *   Item 3: 22\n    *   Item 4: 78\n    *   Item 5: 48\n*   **Total Pool of Items:** There are 7 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that a deal in a later round is worth less than a deal in an earlier round. Specifically, in round r the value is discounted by (0.9)^(r-1). This does not matter in round 1 as it will be 0.9^0, which is 1, but it does influence later rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**  Since there is no offer to respond to, I need to construct an initial offer. It is important to consider that the best outcome for me is to get all the items, but this is an unrealistic proposal to offer to player 2. I should offer player 2 some items, that I value less, in exchange for keeping more items that I value higher. I should also make sure that I get enough value that is above my outside offer. As this is the first turn, I have no need to make an overly generous offer.\n\n    Let's start with a relatively balanced split, biased slightly towards me in terms of the items I value most, and then evaluate the value. Let's try an offer of [3, 3, 2, 1, 2] to Player 2.\n\n    This means I would keep [4, 4, 3, 2, 4]. Let's calculate the value of this:\n\n    *   4 units of Item 1: 4 * 73 = 292\n    *   4 units of Item 2: 4 * 90 = 360\n    *   3 units of Item 3: 3 * 22 = 66\n    *   2 units of Item 4: 2 * 78 = 156\n    *   4 units of Item 5: 4 * 48 = 192\n    *   Total value: 292 + 360 + 66 + 156 + 192 = 1066\n\n    This value (1066) is much higher than my outside offer (112).\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer, because there is none.\n*   I should not walk away, since there are deals available that are far more advantageous than my outside offer.\n*   I should make a counteroffer that I feel Player 2 will accept, but still provides me value greater than my outside offer. The offer of [3, 3, 2, 1, 2] seems to be a reasonable starting point.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer of [3, 3, 2, 1, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 2, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1303\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 55\n    *   Item 2: 36\n    *   Item 3: 87\n    *   Item 4: 32\n    *   Item 5: 25\n*   **Total items:**\n    *   Item 1: 7\n    *   Item 2: 7\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor:** Gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the same deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times the value of the same deal in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 3, 2, 1, 2]. This means I keep [7-3, 7-3, 5-2, 3-1, 6-2] = [4, 4, 3, 2, 4].\n    *   Value of keeping: (4 * 55) + (4 * 36) + (3 * 87) + (2 * 32) + (4 * 25) = 220 + 144 + 261 + 64 + 100 = 789\n*   **Comparison:** 789 is less than my outside offer of 1303. Thus, I should not accept the current offer as it stands.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's start by calculating the value if I were to keep all items.\n    * My total value if I kept all items : (7 * 55) + (7 * 36) + (5 * 87) + (3 * 32) + (6 * 25) = 385 + 252 + 435 + 96 + 150 = 1318\n    * As mentioned before, if I keep [7,7,5,3,5], my value is 1293 which is less than my outside offer.\n    * I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value of at least 1303. Since I currently have less than 1303, this means I have to keep more items.\n    * I will make an initial counter offer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to the other player. This gives me [6, 6, 4, 2, 5]. This gives a total value of (6 * 55) + (6 * 36) + (4 * 87) + (2 * 32) + (5 * 25) = 330 + 216 + 348 + 64 + 125 = 1083 which is still lower than 1303. \n    * Let's try offering player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This gives me a value of 1318 which is higher than my outside offer.\n    * Now lets try keeping [7, 7, 5, 3, 5]. This gives me a value of 1293. So keeping [7, 7, 5, 3, 6] would give 1318.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [3, 3, 2, 1, 2] is worse than my outside offer, so I should not ACCEPT.\n*   I will make a counteroffer that ensures I receive better than my outside offer of 1303. The offer I made above which was to keep all items, is a valid counteroffer, therefore I will propose to give player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 112. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 933 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 0 + 90 x 0 + 22 x 5 + 78 x 0 + 48 x 0\n    which is 110 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 112. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 112\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 73\n    *   Item 2: 90\n    *   Item 3: 22\n    *   Item 4: 78\n    *   Item 5: 48\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 7\n    *   Item 2: 7\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that if the game goes to round 3, the value of the outcome will be multiplied by 0.9^2 = 0.81. If the game concludes this round, the outcome value will be multiplied by 0.9^1 = 0.9. This means it is generally better to make a deal sooner rather than later, but not at the cost of accepting a bad offer.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer on the table is that I receive [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep all of the items (7,7,5,3,6). The value to me is calculated as: \n    (7 * 73) + (7 * 90) + (5 * 22) + (3 * 78) + (6 * 48) = 511 + 630 + 110 + 234 + 288 = 1773. Since this is round 2, this is also multiplied by 0.9, resulting in a present value of 1773*0.9 = 1595.7.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    * Let's calculate the value if I were to give player 2 an even amount.\n    *   Giving player 2 [2, 2, 2, 1, 2] would result in me keeping [5,5,3,2,4]. The value of keeping this would be (5 * 73) + (5 * 90) + (3 * 22) + (2 * 78) + (4 * 48) = 365 + 450 + 66 + 156 + 192 = 1229.\n    * Giving player 2 [3, 3, 2, 1, 2] would result in me keeping [4,4,3,2,4]. The value of keeping this would be (4 * 73) + (4 * 90) + (3 * 22) + (2 * 78) + (4 * 48) = 292 + 360 + 66 + 156 + 192 = 1066.\n    *   Giving player 2 [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] would result in me keeping [6,6,4,3,5]. The value of keeping this would be (6 * 73) + (6 * 90) + (4 * 22) + (3 * 78) + (5 * 48) = 438 + 540 + 88 + 234 + 240 = 1540.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer ([0,0,0,0,0]) results in me keeping everything and has a present value of 1595.7 which is significantly better than my outside offer of 112.\n*   Counteroffers will result in a smaller value if accepted by Player 2.\n*  Accepting the offer from Player 2 in Round 1, despite being worth significantly more than my outside offer, would be a mistake due to its negative value and would represent Mistake 4.\n\nSince the current offer is the equivalent of me receiving all the items and therefore worth much more than my outside offer, I should ACCEPT.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

In round 1, the discount is (0.9)^(1-1) = 1. This means there is no discounting of values in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an initial offer.  I want an offer that's better than my outside offer, so I need to keep valuable items for myself. I also want to avoid mistake 3 (offering everything or nothing). I'll start by offering half or a little less of each item type. Let's try offering the following quantities to Player 2:\n    * Item 1: 1 unit \n    * Item 2: 2 units\n    * Item 3: 2 units\n    * Item 4: 1 unit\n    * Item 5: 2 units\n    This means I would keep:\n    * Item 1: 2 units\n    * Item 2: 2 units\n    * Item 3: 3 units\n    * Item 4: 2 units\n    * Item 5: 3 units\n   \n    My total value for this split would be:\n    (2 * 93) + (2 * 97) + (3 * 74) + (2 * 24) + (3 * 22) = 186 + 194 + 222 + 48 + 66 = 716.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 543. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 642 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 4, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 0 + 64 x 3 + 59 x 4 + 36 x 1 + 26 x 3\n    which is 542 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 543. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

So I should not accept it.\n    \n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that will bring me more value than my outside offer and that also seems reasonable for Player 1. My goal in round 1 is to get an outcome that is better than my outside option, and not to trigger an early walk by making an outrageous offer.\n\nI will try a counteroffer where I keep more of the valuable items and give more of the less valuable items to Player 1.\n\nLet's consider the following as my own proposal to player 1 (what I will give to player 1 in a potential deal) [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]:\n    * Item 1: 0\n    * Item 2: 1\n    * Item 3: 2\n    * Item 4: 0\n    * Item 5: 1\n    Then my value is (3 * 29) + (3 * 64) + (3 * 59) + (3 * 36) + (4 * 26) = 87 + 192 + 177 + 108 + 104 = 668. This is greater than my outside option.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer, so I should not accept it.\n*   My counteroffer [0, 1, 2, 0, 1] is better than my outside offer of 543, providing 668 value.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is 543.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 29\n    *   Item 2: 64\n    *   Item 3: 59\n    *   Item 4: 36\n    *   Item 5: 26\n*   **Total Pool of Items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor applies to any offer that is accepted. That would be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4\n    \n    My value for accepting this offer would be:\n    (2 * 29) + (3 * 64) + (4 * 59) + (2 * 36) + (4 * 26) = 58 + 192 + 236 + 72 + 104 = 662. This is before the discount factor is applied. If the offer is accepted, the discounted value is 662 * 0.9 = 595.8\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, which is 543. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be taken into consideration, so it needs to have a higher value to start with.\n    Let's consider keeping [2, 3, 3, 2, 4] (keeping one additional unit of item 3). I would be offering [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] to Player 1. My value would be:\n    (2 * 29) + (3 * 64) + (3 * 59) + (2 * 36) + (4 * 26) = 58 + 192 + 177 + 72 + 104 = 603. This is before the discount factor is applied. If this offer was to be accepted it would be worth 603 * 0.9 = 542.7\n    Let's consider keeping [2, 3, 4, 2, 4], offering [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This is the current offer. Value is 662, and discounted value is 595.8.\n    Let's consider keeping [3,4,5,3,5] and offering nothing. This would be valued at: (3*29) + (4*64) + (5*59) + (3*36) + (5*26) = 87+256+295+108+130 = 876. Discounted value is 788.4.\n    Let's consider offering [1,1,2,1,1], keeping [2,3,3,2,4]. This offer has a value of 603, and discounted value is 542.7\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The discounted value of accepting the current offer of [1,1,1,1,1] is 595.8, which is greater than my outside offer of 543. The discounted value of offering [1,1,2,1,1] is 542.7, which is less than the outside offer. Keeping all items has a discounted value of 788.4.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\nSince the current offer is worth 595.8, which is better than my outside offer of 543. I should accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 246. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 546 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 0 + 49 x 1 + 32 x 2 + 57 x 0 + 33 x 4\n    which is 245 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 246. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and make a decision for round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 246. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 11 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 49 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 32 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 57 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 33 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   2 units of item 1\n    *   3 units of item 2\n    *   7 units of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   6 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** Gamma is 0.9. This means that later rounds are worth slightly less to me than earlier rounds. The current round has a discount of 0.9^0 = 1. The value of a deal accepted in round 2 will be multiplied by 0.9 and the value of a deal accepted in round 3 will be multiplied by 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since this is round 1, I am choosing what to offer Player 2. I need to consider what division would be acceptable to me (better than my outside offer) and reasonable enough for Player 2 to consider. I should avoid making offers that are too extreme at this stage.\n    Let's try an offer where I keep slightly more than half of each item and evaluate its value. This offer will give Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. This means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. My value for this offer is\n    1 * 11 + 2 * 49 + 4 * 32 + 1 * 57 + 3 * 33 = 11 + 98 + 128 + 57 + 99 = 393. This is better than my outside offer.\n    Let's also consider offering Player 2 slightly less, say only 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. My value for this offer is 2 * 11 + 2 * 49 + 5 * 32 + 1 * 57 + 4 * 33 = 22 + 98 + 160 + 57 + 132 = 469. This is also better than my outside offer.\n    Let's settle on the first offer to give me a better chance of it being accepted. This means I offer Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept because there is no current offer.\n*   I should not walk away as I believe I can get an outcome better than my outside offer.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, I will propose a counteroffer where I give Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 0, 3]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 0 + 49 x 1 + 32 x 2 + 57 x 0 + 33 x 4\n    which is 245 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 246. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 246\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 11, Item 2: 49, Item 3: 32, Item 4: 57, Item 5: 33\n*   **Total item pool:** 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor to apply to the value at the end of round 2 is 0.9 ^ (2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]. This means they keep the rest.\n    *   My value for this offer: (0 * 11) + (1 * 49) + (2 * 32) + (0 * 57) + (2 * 33) = 0 + 49 + 64 + 0 + 66 = 179\n    *   My discounted value for this offer: 179 * 0.9 = 161.1\n    *   Comparing this to my outside offer, 161.1 < 246\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I should keep for myself. My goal is to exceed 246 * 0.9  = 221.4 if I'm going to counteroffer and not walk away. The total number of each item is [2, 3, 7, 1, 6].\n    Let me calculate some example counteroffers.\n\n    Counteroffer 1: give player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. I keep everything.\n    My value: (2 * 11) + (3 * 49) + (7 * 32) + (1 * 57) + (6 * 33) = 22 + 147 + 224 + 57 + 198 = 648\n    Discounted value is 648 * 0.9 = 583.2. This offer would be a significant gain for me compared to the walk option.\n\n    Counteroffer 2: Give player 2 [1, 1, 3, 0, 3]. I keep [1, 2, 4, 1, 3].\n    My value = (1 * 11) + (2 * 49) + (4 * 32) + (1 * 57) + (3 * 33) = 11 + 98 + 128 + 57 + 99 = 393\n    Discounted value = 393 * 0.9 = 353.7.  Also higher than the walk option.\n\n    Counteroffer 3: Give player 2 [0, 0, 2, 0, 0].  I keep [2, 3, 5, 1, 6]\n    My value = (2 * 11) + (3 * 49) + (5 * 32) + (1 * 57) + (6 * 33) = 22 + 147 + 160 + 57 + 198 = 584\n    Discounted value = 584 * 0.9 = 525.6.  Also higher than the walk option.\n\n    Counteroffer 4:  Give Player 2 [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]. I keep [1, 2, 5, 1, 4].\n    My value = (1 * 11) + (2 * 49) + (5 * 32) + (1 * 57) + (4 * 33) = 11 + 98 + 160 + 57 + 132 = 458\n    Discounted value = 458 * 0.9 = 412.2.  Also higher than the walk option.\n\n    Counteroffer 5:  Give Player 2 [0, 1, 2, 0, 2].  This is what is currently on the table. We have already calculated that if I accept, my discounted value would be 161.1, which is less than my outside offer.\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is not acceptable because the discounted value (161.1) is less than my outside offer (246). I should not accept this offer (Mistake 4).\n*   I should not walk away from the negotiation at this stage as my counteroffers all result in a higher payoff than my outside offer.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer. I will choose counteroffer 4 since it seems like a better starting point for negotiation.\n    I will offer [1, 1, 2, 0, 2] to Player 2. This gives me a discounted value of 412.2, higher than the value of my outside offer and a better position compared to counteroffer 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]}\n```\n",

Since it's round 2, any outcome will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means there's a cost to delaying the resolution.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer is [1, 1, 2, 0, 2] (what Player 1 is offering me). This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. My value for this offer is:\n    (1 * 52) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 52) + (0 * 53) + (2 * 28) = 52 + 2 + 104 + 0 + 56 = 214\n    After discounting this is 214 * 0.9 = 192.6\n    \n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer's discounted value (192.6) is greater than my outside offer (160). Therefore, accepting this offer is better than walking away. However, can we do better?\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's explore a counteroffer. I want to keep more of the high-value items (1, 3, 4) and less of the low-value ones (2, 5). Player 1 is currently offering me [1, 1, 2, 0, 2], which means they are keeping [1, 2, 5, 1, 4]. Let's propose giving them [0, 2, 5, 1, 4] and keep [2, 1, 2, 0, 2]. The value of keeping [2, 1, 2, 0, 2] for myself: (2 * 52) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 52) + (0 * 53) + (2 * 28) = 104 + 2 + 104 + 0 + 56 = 266\n    Discounted value is 266*0.9 = 239.4 which is better than accepting the current offer of 192.6. This is also better than my outside offer of 160.\n    \n**3) Make a Decision:**\nI want to maximize my outcome, and the calculated value of my potential counteroffer, after accounting for the discount factor, is better than the discounted value of the current offer which is better than my outside offer.\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer that is more advantageous to myself, as calculated above.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 5, 1, 4]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 0 + 49 x 1 + 32 x 2 + 57 x 0 + 33 x 4\n    which is 245 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 246. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 5, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 5, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 246\n*   **My item values:** 11 for item 1, 49 for item 2, 32 for item 3, 57 for item 4, 33 for item 5.\n*   **Total item pool:** 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since it's round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81. This will be applied to any outcome where an agreement is reached this round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 2, 5, 1, 4]. This means I keep [2-0, 3-2, 7-5, 1-1, 6-4] = [2, 1, 2, 0, 2].  Let's calculate the value of keeping these items:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 11 = 22\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 49 = 49\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 32 = 64\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 57 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 33 = 66\n    *   **Total value of current offer:** 22 + 49 + 64 + 0 + 66 = 201.\n    *   **Discounted Value**: 201 * 0.81 = 162.81\n\n*   **Comparing to outside offer:** My discounted value of accepting the current offer (162.81) is significantly less than my outside offer value of 246. Therefore, I will not accept it.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    *   I need to offer Player 2 something that will be valuable for them, while maximizing my own gains. I need to keep in mind that this is the last round. Player 2 will likely reject any offer that is not as valuable to them as their outside offer. If Player 2 rejects, I get my outside offer value of 246, and they get their outside offer value.\n    * Let's consider a counteroffer that gives me a value close to my outside option, and gives Player 2 a value that seems better than their previous offers. \n    * Let's try offering Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This would give me [2, 3, 7, 1, 6].\n    * Value = 2*11 + 3*49 + 7*32 + 1*57 + 6*33 = 22 + 147 + 224 + 57 + 198 = 648. 648 * 0.81 = 524.88. This is much better than my outside offer, and if player 2 accepts, it would be a great deal for me, but they will probably reject the offer as it is unlikely to be better than their own outside offer. \n    * Now let's try offering Player 2 [1, 1, 3, 0, 3]. This would give me [1, 2, 4, 1, 3]. \n    * My value: 1*11 + 2*49 + 4*32 + 1*57 + 3*33 = 11 + 98 + 128 + 57 + 99 = 393. 393 * 0.81 = 318.33\n    * This is still better than my outside offer. \n    *  Let's try offering Player 2 [0, 1, 4, 1, 5]. This would give me [2, 2, 3, 0, 1].\n    *  My value: 2*11 + 2*49 + 3*32 + 0*57 + 1*33 = 22 + 98 + 96 + 0 + 33 = 249. 249 * 0.81 = 201.69 This is less than my outside offer.\n\n    *  Let's try offering [0, 1, 3, 0, 3]. This would give me [2, 2, 4, 1, 3].\n     * My value = 2 * 11 + 2 * 49 + 4 * 32 + 1 * 57 + 3 * 33 = 22 + 98 + 128 + 57 + 99 = 404. 404 * 0.81 = 327.24.\n\n    * I will choose the [1, 1, 3, 0, 3] offer because this is better than my outside offer. \n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is not good for me since it's less than my outside offer value.\n*   Walking away would give me my outside offer value of 246.\n*   I will make a counteroffer that gives me more value than my outside offer.\n\n**Final Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 0, 3]}\n```\n",

The discount factor will matter in later rounds but not in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer.

If this is not the case, I will iterate by increasing the number of items I keep, until I have an offer that is better than my outside option.\n\n    Let's start with an equal split, giving 1 unit each of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5 to player 2 (rounded down to the nearest unit in the case of item 1, and 7/2 which is 3.5, rounded down to the nearest unit).\n    If I offer [1, 2, 3, 2, 3] to player 2:\n    *   My Keep: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n    *   My Value = (2 * 79) + (3 * 58) + (4 * 93) + (3 * 2) + (3 * 30) = 158 + 174 + 372 + 6 + 90 = 800\n    This is greater than my outside offer of 680, so it is a valid offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept, because there is no current offer.\n*   I should not walk away, because I can make an offer better than my outside offer.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer, [1, 2, 3, 2, 3].\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 2, 3]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1163. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 765 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 7, 5, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 2 + 19 x 2 + 61 x 7 + 63 x 5 + 39 x 6\n    which is 1160 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1163. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since it's round 1, the discount factor (0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1) doesn't yet impact the values. This will apply to subsequent rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer on the table is that I receive [1, 2, 3, 2, 3] items. Let's calculate my value if I accept this offer:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 73 = 73\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 19 = 38\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 61 = 183\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 63 = 126\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 39 = 117\n    *   Total value of current offer: 73 + 38 + 183 + 126 + 117 = 537\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My current offer of 537 is much lower than my outside offer of 1163. I should not accept this offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer of 1163. Let's think about a counteroffer where I keep most of the items and give a small amount to player 1:\n    *   Keep [2, 4, 6, 4, 5] -> give [1,1,1,1,1] to player 1.\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 73 = 146\n        *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 19 = 76\n        *   6 units of item 3: 6 * 61 = 366\n        *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 63 = 252\n        *   5 units of item 5: 5 * 39 = 195\n        *   Total value: 146 + 76 + 366 + 252 + 195 = 1035.  This offer is still not good enough.\n\n    *   Keep [3, 5, 7, 5, 6] -> give [0,0,0,0,0] to player 1 (I keep all items).\n        *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 73 = 219\n        *   5 units of item 2: 5 * 19 = 95\n        *   7 units of item 3: 7 * 61 = 427\n        *   5 units of item 4: 5 * 63 = 315\n        *   6 units of item 5: 6 * 39 = 234\n        *   Total Value: 219 + 95 + 427 + 315 + 234 = 1290\n\n    I need to make a counter offer that is worth more than 1163. It is better to give items away in terms of the lowest value. Item 2 is my lowest value and I am giving 1 unit of that away and keeping the other 4 at the moment. I need to give at least 1 unit of other items in order to offer a valid offer. It is better to give away items from the lowest value: giving away 1 of item 2:\n\n    *   Keep [3, 4, 7, 5, 6] -> give [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] to player 1.\n        *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 73 = 219\n        *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 19 = 76\n        *   7 units of item 3: 7 * 61 = 427\n        *   5 units of item 4: 5 * 63 = 315\n        *   6 units of item 5: 6 * 39 = 234\n        *   Total Value: 219 + 76 + 427 + 315 + 234 = 1271. This is better than 1163. \n    \n    Let's try giving player 1 [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n        *   Keep [3, 4, 6, 5, 6]\n        *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 73 = 219\n        *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 19 = 76\n        *   6 units of item 3: 6 * 61 = 366\n        *   5 units of item 4: 5 * 63 = 315\n        *   6 units of item 5: 6 * 39 = 234\n        *   Total Value: 219 + 76 + 366 + 315 + 234 = 1210. This is still better than 1163.\n        \n    Let's try giving player 1 [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n        *   Keep [3, 4, 6, 4, 6]\n        *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 73 = 219\n        *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 19 = 76\n        *   6 units of item 3: 6 * 61 = 366\n        *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 63 = 252\n        *   6 units of item 5: 6 * 39 = 234\n        *   Total Value: 219 + 76 + 366 + 252 + 234 = 1147.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1 in Round 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 680. This is the guaranteed value I get if I walk away.\n*   **Item Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 79 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 58 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 93 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 2 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 30 per unit\n*   **Total Item Pool:**\n    *   3 units of Item 1\n    *   5 units of Item 2\n    *   7 units of Item 3\n    *   5 units of Item 4\n    *   6 units of Item 5\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that any deal made in round 2 is worth 0.9 times what it would be worth in round 1, and any deal in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 times what it would be worth in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer is [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This means Player 2 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of offer:\n        *   0 * 79 = 0\n        *   1 * 58 = 58\n        *   1 * 93 = 93\n        *   0 * 2 = 0\n        *   0 * 30 = 0\n        *  Total Value of Current Offer: 58 + 93 = 151\n    *   Adjusted for Round 2: 151 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 151 * 0.9 = 135.9\n    *   The current offer is worth 135.9 to me.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** We need to find a counteroffer that is better than walking away (680). Since we have already had a round, we must consider that we are in round 2 and that our value will be multiplied by 0.9. Thus, we need to aim for a value before discount of 680/0.9=755.56\n\n    Let's start by considering an equal division of all items. I would keep [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3]. I cannot keep .5 items so I need to keep all whole numbers of items. I will try keeping [1, 2, 3, 2, 3]:\n    *   Value of keeping:\n        *   1 * 79 = 79\n        *   2 * 58 = 116\n        *   3 * 93 = 279\n        *   2 * 2 = 4\n        *   3 * 30 = 90\n        *   Total: 568. Since 568 * 0.9 = 511.2, this is less than our outside offer so this won't work.\n\n    Let's try keeping as many valuable items as possible. I will try to keep 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. That would mean my offer to Player 2 is [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n        *   Value of keeping:\n        *   2 * 79 = 158\n        *   4 * 58 = 232\n        *   6 * 93 = 558\n        *   3 * 2 = 6\n        *   4 * 30 = 120\n        *   Total: 1074. Since 1074 * 0.9 = 966.6, this is greater than our outside offer so this is an advantageous offer to make.\n\n    This is an advantageous offer for me.\n\n* **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n    *  The value of the current offer (135.9) is much lower than my outside offer of 680.\n    * The total value of my counteroffer ([1, 1, 1, 2, 2]) 966.6, after discount is greater than my outside offer value.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\n*   The current offer (135.9) is much worse than my outside offer of 680, so I should NOT accept.\n*   I will make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer\n*  I should make a COUNTEROFFER of [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1163. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 765 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 7, 5, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 2 + 19 x 2 + 61 x 7 + 63 x 5 + 39 x 6\n    which is 1160 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1163. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1163\n*   **My item values:** \n    *   Item 1: 73\n    *   Item 2: 19\n    *   Item 3: 61\n    *   Item 4: 63\n    *   Item 5: 39\n*   **Total item pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 7 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 7 - 1 = 6 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n    \n    The value of this offer for me is:\n    (2 * 73) + (4 * 19) + (6 * 61) + (3 * 63) + (4 * 39) = 146 + 76 + 366 + 189 + 156 = 933\n    The discounted value is 933 * 0.9 = 839.7. This is less than my outside offer of 1163.\n    \n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to construct a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer when discounted. Since it is round 2, it needs to be significantly better because it will be discounted by 0.9. Also, I need to be mindful of the history of the game, where both players have conceded slightly on each round.\n\nLet me consider offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 1, 1] (this is the number of items I give to player 1):\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 7 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n   \n    The value of this counter offer for me would be:\n    (3*73) + (5*19) + (7*61) + (4*63) + (5*39) = 219 + 95 + 427 + 252 + 195 = 1188\n   Discounted Value = 1188 * 0.9 = 1069.2, which is still below my outside offer.\n    \n\nLet me try a different counteroffer, where I offer Player 1 [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]:\n   *   Item 1: 3 units\n   *   Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n   *   Item 3: 7 - 1 = 6 units\n   *   Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n   *   Item 5: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n   \n   The value of this counteroffer to me is:\n   (3 * 73) + (4 * 19) + (6 * 61) + (4 * 63) + (5 * 39) = 219 + 76 + 366 + 252 + 195 = 1108\n    Discounted value = 1108 * 0.9 = 997.2, this is not better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try giving Player 1 [0,1,0,0,0]:\n   * Item 1: 3\n   * Item 2: 4\n   * Item 3: 7\n   * Item 4: 5\n   * Item 5: 6\n   \n   Value = (3*73) + (4*19) + (7*61) + (5*63) + (6*39) = 219 + 76 + 427 + 315 + 234 = 1271\n    Discounted Value = 1271 * 0.9 = 1143.9.  Still not good enough.\n\nLet's try giving [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\n   * Item 1: 3\n   * Item 2: 5\n   * Item 3: 7\n   * Item 4: 5\n   * Item 5: 6\n  \n  Value = (3 * 73) + (5 * 19) + (7 * 61) + (5 * 63) + (6 * 39) = 219 + 95 + 427 + 315 + 234 = 1290\n  Discounted value = 1290 * 0.9 = 1161. This is also not better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering them only 1 unit of item 5, by offering [0,0,0,0,1]\n\n*   Item 1: 3\n*   Item 2: 5\n*   Item 3: 7\n*   Item 4: 5\n*   Item 5: 5\n\n    Value = (3 * 73) + (5 * 19) + (7 * 61) + (5 * 63) + (5 * 39) = 219 + 95 + 427 + 315 + 195 = 1251\n    Discounted Value = 1251 * 0.9 = 1125.9 This is not better than my outside offer, which is 1163.\n\nOkay, I need to propose an offer that gets me at least 1163/0.9 = 1292.2 in value\nI have total value of 1290 so I will have to walk away, since even keeping all items isn't good enough.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is not good for me (839.7 < 1163). Making a counteroffer is a risk since it might get rejected, as we have to try to gain at least 1163/0.9 = 1292.2. Since even keeping all items is only 1290, which would be worth 1161 after discounting, I should walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 8, 2, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This is significantly less than my outside offer of 658. Therefore, I should not accept the current offer.

Therefore, accepting this offer is a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider making a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer when discounted by the round number. Let me calculate the value of keeping the entire pool of items:\n    6 * 82 + 8 * 9 + 3 * 56 + 2 * 34 + 5 * 56 = 492 + 72 + 168 + 68 + 280 = 1080\n    \n    My outside offer value is 766, so I need to make sure any counter offer I make at round two will provide me with a value greater than 766.\n    \n    Let's try offering [1, 2, 1, 1, 1] to Player 2. \n     This means I would keep:\n       5 of item 1, value 5 * 82 = 410\n       6 of item 2, value 6 * 9 = 54\n       2 of item 3, value 2 * 56 = 112\n       1 of item 4, value 1 * 34 = 34\n       4 of item 5, value 4 * 56 = 224\n    \n    My total value is 410 + 54 + 112 + 34 + 224 = 834.

Your value would be:\n    9 x 4 + 40 x 8 + 37 x 2 + 51 x 2 + 25 x 5\n    which is 657 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 658. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be applied to the value of the accepted offer as 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Value of current offer:**  I receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value for this offer is (0 * 9) + (1 * 40) + (0 * 37) + (0 * 51) + (0 * 25) = 40.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This is my guaranteed fallback.\n*   **Item Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 98\n    *   Item 2: 57\n    *   Item 3: 61\n    *   Item 4: 34\n    *   Item 5: 52\n*   **Total Items:**\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. It will be applied in future rounds. Since this is the first round, it won't affect our decision right now.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer. I must calculate the value of keeping a certain amount of each item, then compare that total value to my outside offer value, and find one that is greater than my outside offer. Also, I should avoid offering all or nothing at this early stage.\n\nLet's explore some potential counteroffers and their values:\n\n    * If I keep [1, 4, 5, 4, 4], I would offer [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]. My value is calculated by 98 * 1 + 57 * 4 + 61 * 5 + 34 * 4 + 52 * 4 = 98 + 228 + 305 + 136 + 208 = 975. 975 > 878 so this would be acceptable.\n    * If I keep [1, 3, 4, 3, 3], I would offer [0, 2, 2, 2, 2]. My value is calculated by 98 * 1 + 57 * 3 + 61 * 4 + 34 * 3 + 52 * 3 = 98 + 171 + 244 + 102 + 156 = 771. 771 < 878 so this would not be acceptable.\n    * If I keep [1, 5, 6, 5, 5], I would offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My value is 1179. 1179 > 878 so this would also be acceptable, but it is not a good strategic move for round 1.\n    * If I keep [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], I would offer [1, 5, 6, 5, 5]. My value is 0. 0 < 878, so this is unacceptable.\n    * I will evaluate keeping [1, 4, 5, 4, 4].

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 1 + 65 x 0 + 52 x 0 + 72 x 1 + 42 x 0\n    which is 163 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 166. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 166.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are 91 for item 1, 65 for item 2, 52 for item 3, 72 for item 4, and 42 for item 5.\n*   **Total pool of items:** 1 unit of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor gamma is 0.9. This means that if I accept an offer in round 1, the value is multiplied by 0.9^(1-1)=1. If I accept in round 2, the value is multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9 and in round 3 by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81. The later the round, the less an offer is worth to both of us.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means they keep [1, 4, 5, 4, 4].\n    My value for the current offer is calculated as follows:\n    (0 * 91) + (1 * 65) + (1 * 52) + (1 * 72) + (1 * 42) = 0 + 65 + 52 + 72 + 42 = 231\n    Since this is round 1, the discounted value is 231 * 1 = 231.\n    \n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what my counteroffer could be, and if it's better than my outside offer of 166. I need to keep in mind that I want to maximize my payoff and avoid making the 5 mistakes mentioned.  Let's consider an example. Suppose I offered Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], this would mean I keep [1, 5, 6, 5, 5]. This values at 91*1 + 65*5 + 52*6 + 72*5 + 42*5 = 91+325+312+360+210 = 1298.  If I counteroffered with [1, 2, 3, 2, 2], meaning I get [0, 3, 3, 3, 3]. The value would be 65*3 + 52*3 + 72*3 + 42*3 = 195 + 156 + 216 + 126 = 693. This value is better than my outside offer.\n    \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n     The current offer of 231 is significantly better than my outside offer of 166.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   **Should I accept the current offer?** The current offer has a value of 231 which is greater than my outside offer of 166. Accepting the offer is a good idea because it doesn't violate any of the 5 mistakes.\n*   **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**  No, the current offer is better than my outside offer.\n*   **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?** Since the current offer is better than my outside offer, I should accept. Making a counteroffer now would be worse since the discounted value decreases as rounds go on.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 5, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 3 + 33 x 2 + 53 x 5 + 11 x 2 + 46 x 2\n    which is 745 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 746. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 746.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are 100 for item 1, 33 for item 2, 53 for item 3, 11 for item 4, and 46 for item 5.\n*   **Total pool of items:** There are 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer on the table is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (what is being offered to me). This means I would receive 1 unit of each item. The value of this is:\n    1 * 100 + 1 * 33 + 1 * 53 + 1 * 11 + 1 * 46 = 243.\n    Since it is round 2, the value would be discounted by 0.9.  243 * 0.9 = 218.7\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a potential counteroffer where I keep the majority of the items and give the other player [1,0,2,0,1]:\n     My value for keeping the rest (5,2,5,2,2) is:\n     5 * 100 + 2 * 33 + 5 * 53 + 2 * 11 + 2 * 46 = 500 + 66 + 265 + 22 + 92 = 945\n     This is better than my outside offer of 746.\n    \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (218.7) is significantly less than my outside offer of 746. The counter offer value (945) is greater than my outside offer, so that is a viable offer to consider.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible compared to my outside offer. Accepting it would be mistake 4.\n*   Walking away is not optimal yet since I can make a better counteroffer.\n*   I should make the counteroffer that I calculated above.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

I also do not want to make mistake 5 and walk away from an offer that is better than my outside offer. I must decide between accepting the offer, or proposing a counteroffer that will be better than the current offer and my previous offer and is not a mistake from the list.\n*    I can propose a counteroffer of [0,0,0,0,0] which means I keep everything. This results in a value of 1180, which after applying the discount factor is 1062, which is much better than the current offer. I will propose this offer.\n* I will not accept an offer that is less than my outside offer value.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 1, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 0 + 60 x 6 + 18 x 1 + 48 x 2 + 5 x 5\n    which is 499 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 500. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 500. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Values of the items:**\n    *   Item 1: 29 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 60 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 18 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 48 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 5 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 7 units\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 12 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.

I want to keep items that I value highly, and propose to give items I value less. Let's consider a few possibilities, making sure the value for me exceeds 500, my outside offer.\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** Offer [2, 4, 0, 1, 6] to Player 2 (and keep [2, 3, 1, 1, 6]):\n        *   Value: (2 * 29) + (3 * 60) + (1 * 18) + (1 * 48) + (6 * 5) = 58 + 180 + 18 + 48 + 30 = 334. This is far below my outside option.\n    *   **Counteroffer 2:** Offer [1, 3, 0, 1, 6] to Player 2 (and keep [3, 4, 1, 1, 6]):\n        *   Value: (3 * 29) + (4 * 60) + (1 * 18) + (1 * 48) + (6 * 5) = 87 + 240 + 18 + 48 + 30 = 423.  This is still below my outside option.\n    *   **Counteroffer 3:** Offer [1, 2, 0, 0, 6] to Player 2 (and keep [3, 5, 1, 2, 6]):\n        *   Value: (3 * 29) + (5 * 60) + (1 * 18) + (2 * 48) + (6 * 5) = 87 + 300 + 18 + 96 + 30 = 531. This is above my outside offer.\n    *   **Counteroffer 4:** Offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 6] to Player 2 (and keep [4, 6, 1, 2, 6]):\n        *   Value: (4 * 29) + (6 * 60) + (1 * 18) + (2 * 48) + (6 * 5) = 116 + 360 + 18 + 96 + 30 = 620. This is also good. I will choose this one since it is higher than 531.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n    *   I won't accept because no offer exists\n    *   I won't walk because I have an opportunity to get an offer worth more than my outside offer.\n    *   I will propose counteroffer 4.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 6]}\n```\n",

This means that any deal reached in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times its face value, and in round 3 will be worth 0.9^2 times its face value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 6]. This means I would get:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4\n    *   Item 2: 7 - 1 = 6\n    *   Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 12 - 6 = 6\n    My total value from this offer is:\n    (4 * 74) + (6 * 98) + (1 * 85) + (2 * 36) + (6 * 17) = 296 + 588 + 85 + 72 + 102 = 1143\n    This is my value in this round, which is multiplied by 0.9^(round-1). So in round 1 the value of the offer is 1143 * 0.9^0 = 1143\n    Since 1143 > 20, the current offer is better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    Let's evaluate a potential counteroffer. I will start with a relatively greedy counteroffer to test the waters: I would propose giving Player 1 just 1 unit of item 2 and 1 unit of item 5, keeping the rest. This would be a counteroffer of [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] to the opponent, leaving me with [4, 6, 1, 2, 11].\n    My value with this would be:\n    (4 * 74) + (6 * 98) + (1 * 85) + (2 * 36) + (11 * 17) = 296 + 588 + 85 + 72 + 187 = 1228\n    Since 1228 > 20, this counteroffer is valid.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\nThe current offer is worth 1143 to me, which is much better than my outside offer of 20. However, if I counteroffer, I could potentially obtain a value of 1228, which is higher than 1143. Therefore, accepting now is not optimal. Because this is the first round, there is no potential for making a mistake based on what was previously offered or accepted. It would be a mistake to offer all items or no items at this stage of the negotiation.\nI should propose the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 500. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 480 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 1, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 0 + 60 x 6 + 18 x 1 + 48 x 2 + 5 x 5\n    which is 499 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 500. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 6]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1 in round 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n*   **My Outside Offer Value:** 500\n*   **Item Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 29\n    *   Item 2: 60\n    *   Item 3: 18\n    *   Item 4: 48\n    *   Item 5: 5\n*   **Total Item Pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 7 units\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 12 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means any deal reached in this round (round 2) will have its value multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. If we wait until round 3 it will be multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer Value:** The current offer on the table is [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] (items offered to me). This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 4 units * 29 = 116\n    *   Item 2: (7 - 1) units * 60 = 360\n    *   Item 3: 1 units * 18 = 18\n    *   Item 4: 2 units * 48 = 96\n    *   Item 5: (12 - 1) units * 5 = 55\n    *   Total value = 116 + 360 + 18 + 96 + 55 = 645\n    *   Adjusted for this round = 645 * 0.9 = 580.5\n\n    Since 580.5 > 500, accepting this deal is better than walking away right now. However, we should consider a counter offer to try to get a better deal.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    Let's examine a few potential counteroffers, remembering to calculate the value *after* the discount factor.\n    *   **Counteroffer 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]** (Offer nothing, keep everything)\n        *   My value = (4 * 29 + 7 * 60 + 1 * 18 + 2 * 48 + 12 * 5 ) * 0.9  = (116 + 420 + 18 + 96 + 60) * 0.9 = 710 * 0.9 = 639\n        \n    *   **Counteroffer 2: [1, 2, 0, 1, 6]** (Give a few items, but keep most of the better ones)\n        *   I would have: (3 * 29 + 5 * 60 + 1 * 18 + 1 * 48 + 6 * 5) * 0.9 = (87 + 300 + 18 + 48 + 30) * 0.9 = 483 * 0.9 = 434.7 (This is bad)\n    *   **Counteroffer 3: [0, 1, 0, 0, 4]** (Give them a little more)\n        *   I would have: (4 * 29 + 6 * 60 + 1 * 18 + 2 * 48 + 8 * 5) * 0.9 = (116 + 360 + 18 + 96 + 40) * 0.9 = 630 * 0.9 = 567\n        \n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n\n    * The current offer on the table has a discounted value of 580.5, which is greater than my outside offer of 500.\n    *   Counteroffer 1 has a value of 639.\n    *   Counteroffer 2 has a value of 434.7.\n    *   Counteroffer 3 has a value of 567.\n    *   Counteroffer 2 should not be considered since it's worse than the outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n*   The current offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] is worth 580.5 after the discount factor, which is greater than my outside offer (500).\n*   Counter offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is a better outcome at 639\n*   Counter offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 4] is worse than the current deal on the table.\n\nI will make a counteroffer that is better than the current deal and better than my outside offer, which is Counteroffer 1, which keeps all items for me.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This means that later rounds are worth less than earlier rounds. For example, if we reach round 2, the value of any agreement for both players would be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1)=0.9. Likewise for round 3, the discount factor would be 0.9^(3-1)=0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so no value to assess.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to construct an offer that is better than my outside offer value. Since I am player 1 and it's round 1, I will try to make an initial offer that favors myself but is still potentially acceptable to the other player. I will start by offering player 2 a subset of each item type while keeping some for myself. Since item 2 and 4 are the most valuable, I will try to keep most of those. Here's an offer I'll evaluate:\n\n    Offer: Player 2 receives [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]. This means I will keep [5, 2, 4, 2, 2].\n    Value to me:\n    *   Item 1: 5 * 35 = 175\n    *   Item 2: 2 * 84 = 168\n    *   Item 3: 4 * 22 = 88\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 92 = 184\n    *   Item 5: 2 * 58 = 116\n    Total value = 175+168+88+184+116 = 731\n\n    731 > 408\n\n    This offer is better than my outside offer, and it is not giving the other player *everything*. \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nSince there is no current offer, and my evaluated counteroffer is better than my outside offer, I will make that counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    74 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 52 x 0 + 85 x 0 + 25 x 1\n    which is 25 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 49. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 5, 2, 2, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 6 + 80 x 5 + 21 x 2 + 9 x 2 + 78 x 7\n    which is 1528 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1529. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 1529.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 87\n    *   Item 2: 80\n    *   Item 3: 21\n    *   Item 4: 9\n    *   Item 5: 78\n*   **Total pool of items:** There are 9 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 7 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor gamma is 0.9. This means that an agreement reached in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its undiscounted value, and an agreement in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its undiscounted value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offered me [2, 3, 2, 2, 2]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 9 - 2 = 7\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 3 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 6 - 2 = 4\n    *   Item 5: 7 - 2 = 5\n    My value for this offer would be:\n    (7 * 87) + (2 * 80) + (3 * 21) + (4 * 9) + (5 * 78) = 609 + 160 + 63 + 36 + 390 = 1258.\n    Since 1258 < 1529, this offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to find a counteroffer where I keep items such that the value is greater than 1529. I will try giving away relatively lower-valued items and keeping more higher-valued ones. Let's try keeping: [7, 4, 4, 4, 6]\n    My value if I keep [7, 4, 4, 4, 6] would be:\n    (7 * 87) + (4 * 80) + (4 * 21) + (4 * 9) + (6 * 78) = 609 + 320 + 84 + 36 + 468 = 1517\n    Still below. I will try keeping [8, 4, 4, 4, 6]:\n     (8 * 87) + (4 * 80) + (4 * 21) + (4 * 9) + (6 * 78) = 696 + 320 + 84 + 36 + 468 = 1604\n    This offer is better than my outside offer. My counteroffer should give player 1:\n    Item 1: 9-8 = 1\n    Item 2: 5-4 = 1\n    Item 3: 5-4 = 1\n    Item 4: 6-4 = 2\n    Item 5: 7-6 = 1\n    My counteroffer is [1,1,1,2,1]\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is 1529. The current offer's value to me (1258) is less than my outside offer. The counteroffer has a value to me of 1604, which is higher.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer, so I should not accept it.\n*   I should not walk away, as I can make a better offer.\n*   I should propose the counteroffer calculated above, [1, 1, 1, 2, 1].\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

Accepting this offer is not in my best interests.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1529. Since my outside offer value is higher than what I would receive by accepting, I will generate an offer that gives me more items.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1 [2, 2, 1, 1, 2]:\n    This would mean I keep:\n        * Item 1: 9 - 2 = 7\n        * Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3\n        * Item 3: 5 - 1 = 4\n        * Item 4: 6 - 1 = 5\n        * Item 5: 7 - 2 = 5\n    My total value if I made this offer would be:\n    (7 * 87) + (3 * 80) + (4 * 21) + (5 * 9) + (5 * 78) = 609 + 240 + 84 + 45 + 390 = 1368\n    This is still less than my outside offer of 1529.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1 [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]:\n    This would mean I keep:\n        * Item 1: 9 - 1 = 8\n        * Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4\n        * Item 3: 5 - 0 = 5\n        * Item 4: 6 - 0 = 6\n        * Item 5: 7 - 1 = 6\n    My total value if I made this offer would be:\n        (8 * 87) + (4 * 80) + (5 * 21) + (6 * 9) + (6 * 78) = 696 + 320 + 105 + 54 + 468 = 1643\n\n    This is better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is not a good idea because it's significantly worse than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away is also suboptimal since I can propose a counteroffer that yields a higher value than my outside offer.\n*   Therefore, I will make the counteroffer of [1, 1, 0, 0, 1].\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 0 + 3 x 3 + 29 x 0 + 14 x 2 + 44 x 1\n    which is 81 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 82. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [4, 3, 3, 3, 4]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

I will start with dividing each item close to half. However, since I value items 1 and 3 much more than others, I will offer a smaller number of those items to Player 2.

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 10 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 16 for item 1, 12 for item 2, 53 for item 3, 86 for item 4, 56 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1026. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 40. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 40. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 669 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 0 + 12 x 3 + 53 x 0 + 86 x 0 + 56 x 0\n    which is 36 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 40. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 40\n*   **My item values:** \n    *   Item 1: 16\n    *   Item 2: 12\n    *   Item 3: 53\n    *   Item 4: 86\n    *   Item 5: 56\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 10 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  This means that if we reach a deal in round 2, the value will be multiplied by 0.9, and if we reach a deal in round 3 it will be multiplied by 0.9^2 = 0.81. This incentivizes making a deal sooner rather than later.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer to me is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].  This means I get 0 of each item, or I keep all of each item type. If I accept, my value will be:\n    *   6 * 16 + 5 * 12 + 10 * 53 + 2 * 86 + 3 * 56 = 96 + 60 + 530 + 172 + 168 = 1026.\n    *   Since this is the first round, there is no discount factor. The offer is worth 1026.\n    *   This is significantly better than my outside offer value of 40.\n*  **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that are better than my outside offer of 40, but also consider the discount factor. Since this is round 1, there's no discount factor yet. I want to keep as much value as I can, while not offering nothing or everything (Mistake 3). I need to propose a counteroffer that gives some items to the other player but keeps more value for myself than my outside offer. I'll start with giving one unit of each item type and see what value that gives the player.\n\nI will try offering one unit of each item type: [1,1,1,1,1]. This would mean I keep the following:\n*   Item 1: 5 units\n*   Item 2: 4 units\n*   Item 3: 9 units\n*   Item 4: 1 unit\n*   Item 5: 2 units\nMy total value for this is:\n5*16 + 4*12 + 9*53 + 1*86 + 2*56 = 80 + 48 + 477 + 86 + 112 = 803. This is much greater than 40.\n\nLet's go a bit more conservative and start by offering [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]. My total value if I offer this is:\nItem 1: 5 * 16 = 80\nItem 2: 4 * 12 = 48\nItem 3: 8 * 53 = 424\nItem 4: 2 * 86 = 172\nItem 5: 3 * 56 = 168\nTotal value = 80+48+424+172+168 = 892\nThis is also much greater than 40.\nLet me try a different offer: Offer the other player [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]:\nMy value if I offer this is:\nItem 1: 5 * 16 = 80\nItem 2: 4 * 12 = 48\nItem 3: 9 * 53 = 477\nItem 4: 2 * 86 = 172\nItem 5: 2 * 56 = 112\nTotal = 80+48+477+172+112 = 889. This also is much greater than 40.\nIt appears I have a lot of room to make counteroffers.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 1026 to me, which is far more than my outside offer of 40.\n*   However, since I'm in round 1, I know that it would be very silly to ACCEPT, as I could make a counteroffer that keeps much of the value for myself and still gets me a value way higher than my outside offer.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer.  I will offer [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] to the other player.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means any value I receive in this round is worth 0.9 times the base value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 10 - 1 = 9 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n\n    My value for this offer is:\n    (5 * 92) + (4 * 80) + (9 * 97) + (2 * 13) + (2 * 2) = 460 + 320 + 873 + 26 + 4 = 1683\n    Applying the discount factor 0.9, we have a discounted offer value of: 1683 * 0.9 = 1514.7\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (1514.7) is less than my outside offer value of 1860.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need a counteroffer that yields a value to me *greater* than my outside offer (adjusted by the discount factor) to be worth pursuing.\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep a large portion of the high value items, for example, [1, 1, 3, 0, 1], i.e. i would give away 1 unit of items 1, 2 and 5, and 3 units of item 3, and no units of item 4.

This means I keep\n        * Item 1: 6\n        * Item 2: 5\n        * Item 3: 9\n        * Item 4: 2\n        * Item 5: 3\n     Value is:\n     (6 * 92) + (5 * 80) + (9 * 97) + (2 * 13) + (3 * 2) = 552 + 400 + 873 + 26 + 6 = 1857. Discounted, this is 1857 * 0.9 = 1671.3, which is still less than my outside option of 1860\n\n     Let's try offering [0,0,0,0,0], i.e. offering nothing. This means I keep\n        * Item 1: 6\n        * Item 2: 5\n        * Item 3: 10\n        * Item 4: 2\n        * Item 5: 3\n    Value is:\n     (6 * 92) + (5 * 80) + (10 * 97) + (2 * 13) + (3 * 2) = 552 + 400 + 970 + 26 + 6 = 1954.

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 79 for item 1, 38 for item 2, 14 for item 3, 21 for item 4, 50 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 692. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 262. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 262. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 606 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    79 x 0 + 38 x 2 + 14 x 1 + 21 x 1 + 50 x 3\n    which is 261 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 262. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step and determine the best course of action for Player 1 in round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 262. This is the minimum value I should aim for in a deal, as I can always walk away with this.\n*   **Item Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 79 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 38 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 14 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 21 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 50 per unit\n*   **Total Pool of Items:**\n    *   3 units of item 1\n    *   6 units of item 2\n    *   4 units of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   3 units of item 5\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that any deal reached in later rounds will be worth less to both players. Therefore, it's generally advantageous to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. In the first round, the discount factor will be 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1, so it does not influence the values.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to formulate a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer of 262. Let's consider various options. I should be aiming to get the most value while still making the other party likely to accept. If I offer too little to them, they will walk. So, I'll try to offer roughly half of the items as a starting point, but adjust slightly to my advantage.\n\n    *   **Offer 1 (Offer 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5):** Keeping the rest:\n        *   My value: (1 * 79) + (3 * 38) + (2 * 14) + (1 * 21) + (2 * 50) = 79 + 114 + 28 + 21 + 100 = 342\n\n        This offer is good, but let's see if we can do better by getting more of the high value items and less of the low value items.\n\n    *   **Offer 2 (Offer 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5):** Keeping the rest:\n        *   My value: (2 * 79) + (4 * 38) + (2 * 14) + (1 * 21) + (2 * 50) = 158 + 152 + 28 + 21 + 100 = 459\n\n        This is a better offer. Let's see if we can do even better by being greedy and pushing the other player.\n\n   *  **Offer 3 (Offer 0 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5):** Keeping the rest:\n        *   My value: (3 * 79) + (4 * 38) + (2 * 14) + (1 * 21) + (2 * 50) = 237 + 152 + 28 + 21 + 100 = 538\n        This is better, but might be too aggressive. Let's try and go a bit less aggressive than this but better than offer 2.\n\n   *  **Offer 4 (Offer 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5):** Keeping the rest:\n        *   My value: (2 * 79) + (3 * 38) + (2 * 14) + (1 * 21) + (2 * 50) = 158 + 114 + 28 + 21 + 100 = 421.\n\n       Offer 2 seems like a reasonable initial offer that is better than my outside offer and still leaves room for negotiation.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Since there's no current offer to accept and I want to avoid walking away at the start, I should make a counteroffer.\n*   Offer 2 gives me a value of 459, which is greater than my outside offer of 262.\n*   Offer 3 or even Offer 4 might be too aggressive for the first round, and I want to leave room to move towards a better outcome for myself, so let's go with offer 2.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine my best course of action.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 50. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values per unit of each item are:\n    *   Item 1: 51\n    *   Item 2: 49\n    *   Item 3: 95\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 46\n*   **Total Pool of Items:**\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 6 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 0 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that value decreases if the negotiation goes to later rounds. A deal in round 1 will have the full value, a deal in round 2 will be worth 0.9 of the value, and a deal in round 3 will be worth 0.81 of the value.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table. I have to make the first offer.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since I am making the first offer, I need to propose a division that I think will maximize my value, and is likely to be accepted by the other player (or at least not lead to an immediate walk). I will consider several potential offers to see their values. My strategy is to try and get a better outcome than my outside offer value, while not offering too much to the other player as that could lead to a suboptimal outcome for me.\n\nLet's start with a proposal that gives half of each item, where possible to the other player:\n- Item 1: give 0 to player 2, keep 1. Value: 1 * 51 = 51\n- Item 2: give 3 to player 2, keep 3. Value: 3 * 49 = 147\n- Item 3: give 2 to player 2, keep 2. Value: 2 * 95 = 190\n- Item 4: give 2 to player 2, keep 3. Value: 3 * 3 = 9\n- Item 5: give 0 to player 2, keep 0. Value: 0 * 46 = 0\nTotal value: 51 + 147 + 190 + 9 + 0 = 397. This is a good start and clearly more than my outside offer value of 50.\n\nI will also check the case where I take everything except 1 item of type 2, this is to avoid mistake number 3:\n- Item 1: give 0 to player 2, keep 1. Value: 1 * 51 = 51\n- Item 2: give 1 to player 2, keep 5. Value: 5 * 49 = 245\n- Item 3: give 0 to player 2, keep 4. Value: 4 * 95 = 380\n- Item 4: give 0 to player 2, keep 5. Value: 5 * 3 = 15\n- Item 5: give 0 to player 2, keep 0. Value: 0 * 46 = 0\nTotal value: 51 + 245 + 380 + 15 + 0 = 691. This is significantly higher than my outside offer of 50.\n\nI will also check a proposal that keeps none of item 3. This might be more palatable to Player 2 and I might get a better outcome this way as it would make Player 2 happy while giving myself a decent outcome.\n\n- Item 1: give 0 to player 2, keep 1. Value: 1 * 51 = 51\n- Item 2: give 3 to player 2, keep 3. Value: 3 * 49 = 147\n- Item 3: give 4 to player 2, keep 0. Value: 0 * 95 = 0\n- Item 4: give 2 to player 2, keep 3. Value: 3 * 3 = 9\n- Item 5: give 0 to player 2, keep 0. Value: 0 * 46 = 0\nTotal value: 51 + 147 + 0 + 9 + 0 = 207\n\nI think the second offer is the best option here as it yields the highest value. I'll make that offer.\n\n**3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n\nI should not accept the current offer because there isn't an offer to accept.\nI should not walk away as I can get a deal that is better than my outside offer.\n\nI will make the counteroffer that gives 1 of item 2 to the other player and keeps the rest.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 871. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 871. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 786 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 4, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 1 + 20 x 5 + 42 x 4 + 100 x 5 + 9 x 0\n    which is 859 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 871. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that if a deal is reached in a later round, the value of the deal is multiplied by gamma^(r-1), where r is the round number. For example, a deal in round 2 would be worth 0.9 times its undiscounted value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 0 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4, and 0 units of Item 5. The items I will keep: 1 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 0 of item 5.\n    My value for the current offer: \n    (1 * 91) + (5 * 20) + (4 * 42) + (5 * 100) + (0 * 9) = 91 + 100 + 168 + 500 + 0 = 859\n    This is less than my outside offer of 871, so I should not accept this offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to make a counteroffer that is worth more than my outside offer of 871. I must consider the quantities of each item I keep and how much each of these items are worth to me. Let me examine some possible counteroffers.\n    - If I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1: I keep everything, which means I have 1 unit of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. \n      My total value = (1 * 91) + (6 * 20) + (4 * 42) + (5 * 100) + (0 * 9) = 91 + 120 + 168 + 500 + 0 = 879. This is greater than my outside offer.\n    - If I offer [1, 5, 4, 5, 0] to Player 1: I would keep 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n       My total value = (0*91) + (1 * 20) + (0 * 42) + (0 * 100) + (0*9) = 20 which is less than my outside offer.\n    - If I offer [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1, I will keep [1, 4, 4, 5, 0], and my value will be 91 + 80 + 168 + 500 + 0 = 839 which is less than my outside offer.\n    - If I offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] to Player 1, I will keep [1, 6, 3, 5, 0], and my value will be 91 + 120 + 126 + 500 + 0 = 837 which is less than my outside offer.\n    - Let's try offering [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], keeping [1, 6, 4, 4, 0]: My total value = 91 + 120 + 168 + 400 + 0 = 779 which is less than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n The current offer is worse than my outside offer, therefore I should reject it and counteroffer. Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1 means that I am keeping everything, which is worth 879 to me.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 871. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 786 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 4, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 1 + 20 x 5 + 42 x 4 + 100 x 5 + 9 x 0\n    which is 859 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 871. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 2, 0, 0, 0].

This would be a strong offer.\n        \n        \n     * Let's try giving player 1 1 unit of Item 2 [0,1,0,0,0].\n          * Then I get 1 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 0 of item 5\n          * Value is 91 + 5*20 + 4*42 + 5*100 + 0 = 91 + 100 + 168 + 500 = 859. Which is still less than the outside offer.\n     *  Let's try to see if I can give them something to test their values, while maintaining an offer more than my outside offer.

This is less than my outside offer.\n        \n    * Since this is the second round and I should be aiming for a deal to not loose out on discounting and I think player 1 is undervaluing items 3 and 4, I should offer them nothing [0,0,0,0,0] since the offer for keeping everything is a good deal for me.\n    \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is unacceptable as it is less than my outside offer and significantly so.\n*   Walking away will only give me the value of my outside offer, which is 871.\n*   The counter offer of [0,0,0,0,0] gives me 879. Which, when taking into account the discount, the value will be 879 * 0.9 = 791.1, so I want to get the deal made.\n\nTherefore, I should make the counter offer [0,0,0,0,0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 191. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 375 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 0 + 15 x 2 + 24 x 2 + 9 x 2 + 47 x 2\n    which is 190 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 191. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that outcomes in later rounds are slightly devalued. However, it's round 1, so the discount factor is not a huge concern yet.\n*   **Current Offer:** None. I am the first player.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Since there is no current offer, accepting it is not an option.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n    I should try to keep a lot of item 5 (value 47) and a few of item 4 (value 9). I want to ensure that my offer is not too generous, and I should propose to keep most of my high-value items and give less of these to player 2. I'll start with an offer that I keep the majority of my preferred items and evaluate. I will start with offering the other player 1 unit of each item.\n\n    If I offer the other player 1 unit of each item my values would be:\n        * Item 1: (2 - 1) * 30 = 30\n        * Item 2: (3 - 1) * 15 = 30\n        * Item 3: (2 - 1) * 24 = 24\n        * Item 4: (2 - 1) * 9 = 9\n        * Item 5: (3 - 1) * 47 = 94\n        * Total Value = 187\n\n    This is less than my outside offer value, so I need to iterate. I need to keep more of item 5. Let's try offering the other player only 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 0 units of item 5.\n\n    My values would be:\n        * Item 1: (2 - 1) * 30 = 30\n        * Item 2: (3 - 1) * 15 = 30\n        * Item 3: (2 - 1) * 24 = 24\n        * Item 4: (2 - 1) * 9 = 9\n        * Item 5: (3 - 0) * 47 = 141\n        * Total Value = 234\n\n    This is greater than my outside offer value of 191.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is not an option as there is no offer.\n*   Walking away means I get 191, but I can do better.\n*   I will propose the counteroffer that is better than my outside offer value.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

This is my guaranteed fallback, so I should never accept anything worth less than this.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 30\n    *   Item 2: 15\n    *   Item 3: 24\n    *   Item 4: 9\n    *   Item 5: 47\n*   **Total items:** There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. Since it is round 2, if I accept now my value is multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.  If I wait and get a deal at round 3, then it will be 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer on the table is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. The value to me is:\n    (0 * 30) + (1 * 15) + (0 * 24) + (0 * 9) + (0 * 47) = 15\n    This is less than my outside offer of 191, and is far too low.\n*   **Value of current offer adjusted by discount rate** : 15 * 0.9 = 13.5. Still far too low.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer value, even when discounted, and also potentially better than my previous offer. My previous offer gave Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], meaning I would keep [1, 2, 1, 1, 3]. The value of that offer was:\n    (1 * 30) + (2 * 15) + (1 * 24) + (1 * 9) + (3 * 47) = 30 + 30 + 24 + 9 + 141 = 234\n    This is already better than my outside offer.\n    I need to construct a new counteroffer that is at least better than my outside offer and better than my previous offer and isn't worse than my outside offer. I will construct an offer that gives more to me and less to Player 2. Let's consider [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]:\n    (2 * 30) + (2 * 15) + (2 * 24) + (2 * 9) + (2 * 47) = 60 + 30 + 48 + 18 + 94 = 250. \n    This is an offer that keeps [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] for me.\n    This is better than my outside offer, and better than my previous offer.\n    Let's consider another offer of [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] - this keeps [2, 2, 2, 2, 3] for me. This has value:\n    (2 * 30) + (2 * 15) + (2 * 24) + (2 * 9) + (3 * 47) = 60 + 30 + 48 + 18 + 141 = 297\n    This is a good offer, but maybe I can do better. Let's try [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This keeps everything for me.\n    (2 * 30) + (3 * 15) + (2 * 24) + (2 * 9) + (3 * 47) = 60 + 45 + 48 + 18 + 141 = 312\n    This is even better, as it gives the maximum possible for me. I will offer this and risk the game ending early.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible for me.\n*   Walking away gives me 191, which is better than the current offer.\n*   My previous offer was worth 234, which is far better than my outside offer.\n*   I should make a counteroffer that favors myself. \n*   I will offer the other player [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], keeping everything for myself.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 2, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 1 + 43 x 3 + 2 x 2 + 42 x 1 + 96 x 2\n    which is 388 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 392. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 0 + 11 x 2 + 38 x 0 + 30 x 0 + 86 x 0\n    which is 22 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 24. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 24\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 30\n    *   Item 2: 11\n    *   Item 3: 38\n    *   Item 4: 30\n    *   Item 5: 86\n*   **Total pool of items:** 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 1, the discount factor will be 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1, meaning the current round offers are not discounted.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep 6 - 2 = 4 units of item 1, 5 - 0 = 5 units of item 2, 3 - 0 = 3 units of item 3, 0 - 0 = 0 units of item 4, and 3 - 0 = 3 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of items I keep: (4 * 30) + (5 * 11) + (3 * 38) + (0 * 30) + (3 * 86) = 120 + 55 + 114 + 0 + 258 = 547\n    * Since this offer is at round 1 the value of this offer is 547 * 1 = 547\n    *   547 > 24. Accepting is better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few, focusing on not making obvious mistakes as defined in the prompt. For example, we want to keep our counteroffer at least at our outside offer value, and avoid giving nothing or everything away. \n    *   Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:  My value would be 6 * 30 + 5 * 11 + 3 * 38 + 0 * 30 + 3 * 86 = 180 + 55 + 114 + 0 + 258 = 607. 607 > 24. This is a feasible offer and could be considered if we were not currently in a positive position.\n    *  Offering [3, 2, 1, 0, 1]: My value would be 3 * 30 + 3 * 11 + 2 * 38 + 0 * 30 + 2 * 86 = 90+33+76+0+172 = 371. This offer would make the value of what we have 371 (371 > 24)\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer gives me a value of 547, which is greater than my outside offer of 24. Since the value is greater than the outside offer, accepting the current offer is the most straightforward option.\n*   A counteroffer could attempt to get me a higher value, but it is risky because it might lead to the deal not being made. Since I don't have any offers worse than my outside offer, I don't need to take a risk by making a counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n",

Let's calculate the value to me of keeping all the items.\n\n    *  0 units of item 1: 0 * 56 = 0\n    *  3 units of item 2: 3 * 63 = 189\n    *  2 units of item 3: 2 * 71 = 142\n    *  6 units of item 4: 6 * 68 = 408\n    *  4 units of item 5: 4 * 63 = 252\n    *   Total value: 0 + 189 + 142 + 408 + 252 = 991\n\n    I know my total value of all items is 991.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 373\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 23, Item 2: 85, Item 3: 76, Item 4: 85, Item 5: 3\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 0, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 6, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times the actual value of the deal, and an offer accepted in round 3 will be worth 0.81 (0.9*0.9) times the actual value of the deal.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 2, 1, 3, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 23 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 85 = 170\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 76 = 76\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 85 = 255\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   Total value of the current offer: 0 + 170 + 76 + 255 + 6 = 507\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (507) is greater than my outside offer (373).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Before proposing a counteroffer, I'll calculate the value of keeping all items myself.\n    * I keep [0, 3, 2, 6, 4]:\n    * 0 * 23 + 3 * 85 + 2 * 76 + 6 * 85 + 4 * 3 = 0 + 255 + 152 + 510 + 12 = 929\n   \n    If I proposed to keep everything (which is not sensible to offer) it will give me a value of 929. Any counteroffer must be somewhere between 373 and 929.\n\n   To make a counteroffer I need to figure out what items I want to keep and which items I can give away. I should try to keep more of items that I value more, and less of items I value less.\n\n   For instance, lets evaluate an offer where I keep [0, 3, 2, 6, 0]:\n   * 0 * 23 + 3 * 85 + 2 * 76 + 6 * 85 + 0 * 3 = 0 + 255 + 152 + 510 + 0 = 917. This is a strong offer, and would mean offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 4] to player 1.\n   \n   Lets evaluate an offer where I keep [0, 2, 1, 4, 0]:\n   * 0 * 23 + 2 * 85 + 1 * 76 + 4 * 85 + 0 * 3 = 0 + 170 + 76 + 340 + 0 = 586. This is still better than my outside offer, so let's use this as an example of how to think about this. This would mean offering [0, 1, 1, 2, 4].\n    \n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer (507) is better than my outside offer (373). Thus, I should not walk away and make a counter offer.\n*   If I choose to accept the current offer I get 507, which is great.\n*   Making a counteroffer will mean that if I am successful I will not get the discount, but I may get a better offer.\n*   I want to get as many items of type 2,3, and 4 as possible, and not so many of type 5.\n\nLet's propose the counteroffer [0, 1, 1, 2, 3], keeping [0, 2, 1, 4, 1]:\n* 0 * 23 + 2 * 85 + 1 * 76 + 4 * 85 + 1 * 3 = 0 + 170 + 76 + 340 + 3 = 589\n\nThis is better than the current offer of 507, so this is a good counteroffer. I should not accept now, as I can get a better offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer that keeps more of the items that I value more highly.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 115. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 963 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 0 + 63 x 0 + 71 x 1 + 68 x 0 + 63 x 0\n    which is 71 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 115. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

This is my undiscounted value. With the discount it is 532 * 0.9 = 478.8.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, discounted by gamma = 0.9\n     Let's see the value of my previous offer [0, 2, 1, 3, 2]:\n    *   Item 1: 0 - 0 = 0\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 2 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 6 - 3 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2\n    My value is (0 * 56) + (1 * 63) + (1 * 71) + (3 * 68) + (2 * 63) = 0 + 63 + 71 + 204 + 126 = 464\n    Discounted value is 464 * 0.9 = 417.6. This is worse than the value of the current offer. \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My current offer of [0, 1, 1, 2, 3] has a discounted value of 478.8, and my outside offer is 115. Since 478.8 is significantly greater than 115, accepting the current offer seems better than walking away.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is very good, and far better than my outside offer.\n*   Making a counteroffer would decrease my total value by the discount factor in the next round, so I will accept the current offer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't immediately affect the value of the deal, but it will if we reach later rounds. We will use the value of 1 for gamma in this round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to formulate a counteroffer that benefits me and is better than my outside option.\n\nLet's evaluate some potential counteroffers:\n\n*   **Keeping most items:** Let's consider keeping most items and offering just a few items to Player 2. Let's try offering [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] to the other player. This means I keep [3, 5, 6, 2, 5]. The value for me is:\n     3*27 + 5*70 + 6*66 + 2*91 + 5*41 = 81 + 350 + 396 + 182 + 205 = 1214.\nThis offer is a great starting point since it is much higher than my outside offer.\n\n*   **More balanced offer:** Let's try another approach. If I offered [2, 3, 3, 1, 3] to the other player, I would keep [2, 3, 4, 1, 3]. The value to me would be:\n    2*27 + 3*70 + 4*66 + 1*91 + 3*41 = 54 + 210 + 264 + 91 + 123 = 742.  This is still more than my outside option and likely a good starting point.\n\n*   **Offer too little:** If I offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to the other player, I would be keeping all of the items and the total value would be: \n    4*27 + 6*70 + 7*66 + 2*91 + 6*41 = 108 + 420 + 462 + 182 + 246 = 1418. This is my max value of the combined items, this would leave the other player nothing and be a clear bad offer for them.\n\n*   **Outside offer value check:**  My outside offer is 585.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no offer on the table, I must make a counteroffer. I want to make a proposal that is beneficial to me but also not so extreme that it is instantly rejected, as this could lead to a loss when the discount factor is applied in later rounds. I will make the offer: [2, 3, 3, 1, 3]. This offer results in a total value for me of 742, which is well above my outside offer, and leaves value for player 2 as well. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 3, 1, 3]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 30. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 1 + 44 x 0 + 46 x 0 + 81 x 0 + 71 x 0\n    which is 25 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 30. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 3, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 3, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 30\n*   **My item values:** \n    *   Item 1: 25\n    *   Item 2: 44\n    *   Item 3: 46\n    *   Item 4: 81\n    *   Item 5: 71\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 6 units\n    *   Item 3: 7 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  This means that a deal in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times the value of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 will be worth 0.81 times the value of a deal in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 3, 3, 1, 3]. This means I get:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 25 = 50\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 44 = 132\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 46 = 138\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 81 = 81\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 71 = 213\n    *   **Total value of current offer:** 50 + 132 + 138 + 81 + 213 = 614\n\n    Since this is round 1, the discounted value is just 614.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My current offer value (614) is significantly higher than my outside offer value (30). Therefore, accepting this offer is better than walking away right now.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's think about what a good counteroffer would look like.  Since the current offer is already quite good, I don't want to be too greedy, but I also don't want to leave too much on the table for Player 1.  Let's consider an offer where I keep at least half of the items, where the item is divisible and rounding is acceptable.\n    *   Keeping roughly half would mean keeping [2, 3, 3, 1, 3]. Let's see what this would look like:\n    *   If I keep 2 of item 1, this is 2*25 = 50\n    *   If I keep 3 of item 2, this is 3*44 = 132\n    *   If I keep 3 of item 3, this is 3*46 = 138\n    *   If I keep 1 of item 4, this is 1*81 = 81\n    *   If I keep 3 of item 5, this is 3*71 = 213\n    *   Total = 614. So I have no reason to offer this as this would be the same as accepting.\n    \n   Let's try offering Player 1 the following: [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]. If I offer this to player 1, I will keep the remaining which are: [3, 4, 4, 2, 4].\n   *   My value = 3*25 + 4*44 + 4*46 + 2*81 + 4*71 = 75+176+184+162+284=881.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is excellent and way better than my outside option. However, to avoid mistake 3 of accepting on the first round, I should consider offering something of my own. The value of my counteroffer of [1,2,3,0,2] is 881, which is greater than my outside offer and the current offer. \n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]}\n```\n",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the optimal action for Player 1 in round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 147.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 12\n    *   Item 2: 8\n    *   Item 3: 74\n    *   Item 4: 93\n    *   Item 5: 82\n*   **Total item pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 9\n    *   Item 2: 9\n    *   Item 3: 8\n    *   Item 4: 4\n    *   Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of a round 1 deal. A round 3 deal is worth 0.81 times a round 1 deal.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since we are in the first round and we are player 1, we need to make an offer. We need to make a counteroffer that is better for us than walking away with our outside offer. Let's start by considering an initial counteroffer where we give the other player a relatively small number of items. I will start by offering 1 unit of each item to player 2. This leaves me with 8 of item 1, 8 of item 2, 7 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5. Let's calculate the value of that:\n\n    *   8 units of item 1: 8 * 12 = 96\n    *   8 units of item 2: 8 * 8 = 64\n    *   7 units of item 3: 7 * 74 = 518\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 93 = 279\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 82 = 164\n    *   Total value = 96 + 64 + 518 + 279 + 164 = 1121\n\nThis total value of 1121 is much better than my outside option of 147. It is also safe, since it does not make mistakes 1-3. Therefore this will be a good offer to start with.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer, as there isn't one.\n*   I should not walk away, because I can make an offer that is much better than the outside option.\n*   I will make a counteroffer to player 2 with 1 unit of each item. This means I keep 8 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 317. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 317. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 252 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 8, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 0 + 19 x 5 + 17 x 8 + 23 x 3 + 8 x 2\n    which is 316 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 317. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I need to keep at least 317 worth of value after offering items to Player 1.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer's value (492) is higher than my outside offer value (317).\n*   I don't want to walk away and get only 317 when I have an offer worth 492.\n*   Since this is the first round, offering no items or all items is a mistake.\n*   Since I am trying to maximize my value, I will look for an offer that would make me more than the current value while also being better than my outside offer.\n    * I want to avoid making an offer worse than the current offer of 492, so I need to be strategic and keep enough valuable items.\n\nLet me consider a counteroffer where I offer player one 2 units each, so I keep 7 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nThis has value to me of: (7 * 17) + (7 * 19) + (6 * 17) + (2 * 23) + (1 * 8) = 119 + 133 + 102 + 46 + 8 = 408\n\nThis value of 408 is less than my current offer of 492. I want to try and move away from that, so I will attempt an even better offer.\n\nLet me consider keeping [8, 8, 7, 3, 2], which is equivalent to offering [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This has value 492, as calculated before.\n\nLet me consider keeping [7, 7, 6, 3, 1], which means offering [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]. The value would be:\n(7 * 17) + (7 * 19) + (6 * 17) + (3 * 23) + (1 * 8) = 119+133+102+69+8 = 431\n\nLet me consider keeping [7, 7, 5, 3, 1], which means offering [2, 2, 3, 1, 2].\n(7 * 17) + (7 * 19) + (5 * 17) + (3 * 23) + (1 * 8) = 119 + 133 + 85 + 69 + 8 = 414\n\nSince I believe I can get a better value out of negotiation, I will make a counteroffer to try and push my value up.\n\nTherefore, since I have a strong offer on the table that is higher than my outside offer, and I believe I can get a better deal, I will make a counteroffer rather than accepting.\n\nI'll offer [2, 2, 2, 1, 2], which results in me keeping [7, 7, 6, 3, 1] with a value of 431.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

So I should not WALK.\n*  Counteroffer 1, 2, and 3 also would provide a greater discounted value than my outside offer and so would be acceptable. \n*   Since we are in the second round of 3, it is worth proposing a counter offer to try and get a better deal. I will pick the offer that gives me the highest value and still isn't unreasonable, which is counteroffer 1. \n\nTherefore, I will make counteroffer 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 317. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 252 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 8, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 0 + 19 x 5 + 17 x 8 + 23 x 3 + 8 x 2\n    which is 316 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 317. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to make an informed decision.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 577\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 74\n    *   Item 2: 33\n    *   Item 3: 35\n    *   Item 4: 22\n    *   Item 5: 17\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 5\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 1\n    *   Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  This means that any deal agreed upon later will be worth less. In round 1, the discount factor has no impact. If the process concludes after r=1 round, gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I am player 1 and it is round 1, I need to propose a counteroffer. I should aim for a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer value of 577 for me. Since no offer currently exists, I don't need to compare it to any current offer, and I should try to get the largest gain at this round with a reasonable split.\n    Let's start by considering an offer where I keep most of the valuable items and give the other player less valuable items. A starting point for a reasonable offer is to offer the other party half of the total items (rounded down for odd numbers). This looks like offering 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. Then, calculate the value of this offer:\n    * My remaining items: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    * My value from these items: (2 * 74) + (3 * 33) + (2 * 35) + (1 * 22) + (3 * 17) = 148 + 99 + 70 + 22 + 51 = 390\n    This is less than my outside offer of 577. Therefore, I should offer less than half the items to the other player, starting by offering no item 1.\n    I'll iterate a different counteroffer now, let's try offering the other player: 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 2 of item 5.\n    * My remaining items: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n    * My value from these items: (3 * 74) + (3 * 33) + (2 * 35) + (1 * 22) + (3 * 17) = 222 + 99 + 70 + 22 + 51 = 464. This is also not better than my outside offer.\n    I will need to give even less, let's consider giving 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\n    * My remaining items: 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 4 of item 5\n    * My value from these items: (3 * 74) + (4 * 33) + (2 * 35) + (1 * 22) + (4 * 17) = 222 + 132 + 70 + 22 + 68 = 514. This is also less than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's consider giving very little to the other player. Offer 0 of each item to the other player:\n    *   My remaining items: 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 5 of item 5\n    *   My value: (3 * 74) + (5 * 33) + (3 * 35) + (1 * 22) + (5 * 17) = 222 + 165 + 105 + 22 + 85 = 599\n    This is the max possible.\n\n    Let's try an offer that is slightly more balanced and see if it provides an equal or better value than my outside offer of 577. I'll try giving 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 0 of item 5.\n    * My remaining items: 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 5 of item 5.\n    * My value: (3 * 74) + (5 * 33) + (2 * 35) + (1 * 22) + (5 * 17) = 222 + 165 + 70 + 22 + 85 = 564. This is worse.\n\n    Let's try giving 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 0 of item 5.\n    * My remaining items: 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 5 of item 5.\n    * My value: (3 * 74) + (4 * 33) + (3 * 35) + (1 * 22) + (5 * 17) = 222 + 132 + 105 + 22 + 85 = 566.\n\n    Let's try giving 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\n     * My remaining items: 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 4 of item 5.\n    * My value: (3 * 74) + (5 * 33) + (3 * 35) + (1 * 22) + (4 * 17) = 222 + 165 + 105 + 22 + 68 = 582. This is slightly better than my outside offer.\n\n     Let's try giving 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\n     * My remaining items: 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 4 of item 5.\n    * My value: (3 * 74) + (4 * 33) + (3 * 35) + (1 * 22) + (4 * 17) = 222 + 132 + 105 + 22 + 68 = 549.\n\n    Based on the above, giving away one item 5 is the best starting offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer because there is no current offer.\n*   I should not walk away because I can propose an offer with higher value than my outside offer.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer of giving the other player 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 1 of item 5, which gives me a value of 582 (582*1=582).\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

I must choose between making a counteroffer or walking away.**\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to construct a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 181, accounting for the number of items and their values. Since this is round 1, I want to aim for a good initial offer that leaves room for negotiation but still protects my outside offer.\n\n    *   Let's try an offer where I keep most of the valuable items and give away some of the lower-value ones. I'll keep [3, 3, 2, 3, 0] of [item1, item2, item3, item4, item5].\n        - Value = (3 * 92) + (3 * 14) + (2 * 32) + (3 * 87) + (0 * 71) = 276 + 42 + 64 + 261 + 0 = 643\n        - The value of this offer is 643 which is higher than my outside offer.\n\n    * This seems like a strong offer, let's try it. This means that I am giving away [1, 2, 1, 1, 1] items to the other player.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\n*   I will make a counteroffer to Player 2 because it is beneficial to start negotiating.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 499. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 576 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Then my value is (3 * 92) + (3 * 14) + (2 * 32) + (3 * 87) + (1 * 71) = 276 + 42 + 64 + 261 + 71 = 714\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Accepting the current offer is very good for me at 845.1\n    *   My outside offer value is 181.\n    *   Both possible counteroffers are better than the outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is very beneficial for me, and is much higher than my outside offer, so there's no real reason to make a counteroffer.\n*   There is no reason to walk away as the current offer is great.\n*   I should accept the current offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 778. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 855 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 3, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 3 + 49 x 5 + 49 x 3 + 46 x 5 + 91 x 0\n    which is 772 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 778. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

I will start by considering giving half of the items to player 2 and keeping half for myself. If there are an odd number of a given item, player 2 gets the smaller half.\n\n    *   My proposed offer to Player 2: [1, 2, 1, 2, 2].

I will give more items that are low value and keep more items that have a high value\n\n    *   My proposed offer to Player 2: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] This means I keep [3, 4, 3, 4, 4]\n    *   My value:\n        *   3 * 50 = 150\n        *   4 * 49 = 196\n        *   3 * 49 = 147\n        *   4 * 46 = 184\n        *   4 * 91 = 364\n        *  Total value = 1041\n\n    *   This offer is better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n    *   The offer of [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] is better than my outside option, and it doesn't violate any of the mistakes described.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer where I give Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 3, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 3 + 49 x 5 + 49 x 3 + 46 x 5 + 91 x 0\n    which is 772 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 778. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 778\n*   **My item values:** \n    *   Item 1: 50\n    *   Item 2: 49\n    *   Item 3: 49\n    *   Item 4: 46\n    *   Item 5: 91\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 5\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be applied at 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9 if the process concludes now. If the process were to conclude next round the discount factor would be 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep all the items, so my value would be:\n    * 3 * 50 + 5 * 49 + 3 * 49 + 5 * 46 + 4 * 91 = 150 + 245 + 147 + 230 + 364 = 1136. Since the negotiation is happening in round 2, the discounted value of accepting this offer is 1136 * 0.9 = 1022.4.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to make an offer better than my outside offer of 778. I want to keep as much of the highly valued item 5 as possible.\n    * If I were to offer [0,0,0,0,0], my value would be 1022.4, which would certainly be better than walking away. However this has already been proposed by Player 2 and is the current offer, so there's no point in proposing it again.\n    *   Let's consider offering Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. My value would be 3*50 + 4*49 + 3*49 + 4*46 + 4*91 = 150 + 196 + 147 + 184 + 364 = 1041. The discounted value of this is 1041 * 0.9 = 936.9.\n    * Let's consider offering [1,2,1,2,0]. This keeps [2,3,2,3,4] for me, so my value is 2*50 + 3*49 + 2*49 + 3*46 + 4*91 = 100+147+98+138+364 = 847. The discounted value of this is 847 * 0.9 = 762.3, which is lower than my outside offer of 778.\n    * Let's offer [0,0,0,0,1]. This leaves me with [3,5,3,5,3], and has a value of 3*50+5*49+3*49+5*46+3*91 = 150 + 245 + 147 + 230 + 273 = 1045. The discounted value of this offer is 1045*0.9 = 940.5.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 1022.4 which is better than my outside offer. This is the highest value offer currently on the table, so I should accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

I need to calculate the value of a few different potential counteroffers and choose the one that makes the most sense.\n    *   **Option 1: Keeping 2 of each item:** \n       * I would keep [2, 2, 2, 1, 2] and offer [2, 3, 2, 0, 3] to player 1\n        My value: (2 * 99) + (2 * 71) + (2 * 41) + (1 * 33) + (2 * 60) = 198 + 142 + 82 + 33 + 120 = 575\n    *   **Option 2: Keeping most valuable items, leaving less valuable ones:**\n       * I keep [4, 4, 2, 1, 4] and offer [0, 1, 2, 0, 1] to player 1\n        My value: (4 * 99) + (4 * 71) + (2 * 41) + (1 * 33) + (4 * 60) = 396 + 284 + 82 + 33 + 240 = 1035\n    *   **Option 3: Keep the items Player 1 offered me and keep the rest:**\n       * Player 1 offered [0, 4, 1, 0, 0]. I will keep [4, 1, 3, 1, 5] and offer [0, 4, 1, 0, 0].\n        My value: (4 * 99) + (1 * 71) + (3 * 41) + (1 * 33) + (5 * 60) = 396 + 71 + 123 + 33 + 300 = 923\n    *   **Option 4: Keep most valuable items and some of the others:** \n       * Keep [3, 3, 2, 0, 3] and offer [1, 2, 2, 1, 2] to player 1.\n        My value: (3 * 99) + (3 * 71) + (2 * 41) + (0 * 33) + (3 * 60) = 297 + 213 + 82 + 0 + 180 = 772\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer, if accepted, would give me a value of 325, which is much better than my outside offer of 215. Option 1 gives 575, Option 2 gives 1035, option 3 gives 923, and option 4 gives 772, all are better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0, 4, 1, 0, 0] gives me a value of 325, which is better than my outside offer of 215.\n*   I will propose option 2 with a value of 1035 which is better. I will offer [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n*   I am not going to accept, nor walk away. \n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 827. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 827. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 768 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 3, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 4 + 21 x 2 + 51 x 3 + 44 x 0 + 70 x 5\n    which is 825 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 827. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 827\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 70\n    *   Item 2: 21\n    *   Item 3: 51\n    *   Item 4: 44\n    *   Item 5: 70\n*   **Total pool of items:** 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer to me is [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]. This means I would get:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 70 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 21 = 21\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 51 = 102\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 44 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 70 = 70\n    *   Total value of current offer: 0 + 21 + 102 + 0 + 70 = 193.\n    *   Discounted Value: 193 * 0.9 = 173.7\n    *   This is far below my outside offer of 827, so I should not accept it.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to calculate counteroffers that yield a value greater than my outside offer after the discount factor. Since this is round 2, I need the value of my items in the counteroffer to be greater than 827 / 0.9 which is approximately 918.89.\n    *   **Keeping everything except 1 of item 2:** I keep [4, 4, 4, 1, 5]. The other player will receive [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n       * 4 * 70 + 4 * 21 + 4 * 51 + 1 * 44 + 5 * 70 = 280 + 84 + 204 + 44 + 350 = 962.\n    *   **Offering 0 of each item**: [4, 5, 4, 1, 5].  4*70 + 5*21 + 4*51 + 1*44 + 5*70 = 280 + 105 + 204 + 44 + 350 = 983. This is higher than my outside offer, but is not strategically advantageous (Mistake 3). It is still larger than 918.89, so could work.\n    *   **Offering 1 of item 2 and 1 of item 3,** keeping [4,4,3,1,5].  4*70 + 4*21 + 3*51 + 1*44 + 5*70 = 280 + 84 + 153 + 44 + 350 = 911, less than the required 918.89.\n    *   **Offering 1 of item 2**: keep [4,4,4,1,5], as above: 962.\n    *   **Offering 1 of item 3 and 1 of item 5** keep [4,5,3,1,4]: 280 + 105 + 153 + 44 + 280 = 862, too low\n\nLet's try offering 1 of item 2 and 1 of item 3: Player 2 gets [0, 1, 1, 0, 0] and I keep [4, 4, 3, 1, 5]. My value is 911, which is too low after the discount factor.\nLet's try keeping [4, 4, 4, 1, 5]. I offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. My value is 962. 962 * 0.9 = 865.8 This is greater than my outside offer of 827.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer. Keeping [4, 4, 4, 1, 5] by offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] to player 2 gives me a discounted value of 865.8, which is greater than my outside offer of 827.\n Therefore I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This is also a good deal. \n     \n      Let's consider one more offer:\n     * Item 1: 1 units, value 99\n     * Item 2: 1 units, value 71\n     * Item 3: 1 units, value 41\n     * Item 4: 0 units, value 0\n     * Item 5: 1 units, value 60\n      Total: 271\n      This would be an offer of [3, 4, 3, 1, 4]\n      Discounted value = 271 * 0.9 = 243.9 This is also a good offer.\n\nLet me go with a counteroffer that is generous enough to be accepted, but still leaves me with a good outcome.

My value would be: 4 * 19 + 1 * 13 + 4 * 90 + 4 * 62 + 4 * 82 = 76 + 13 + 360 + 248 + 328 = 1025. This is a very generous offer for me, but might be difficult for Player 2 to accept.\n\n    Let's try an offer where I keep most of the high value items: offer [1, 0, 2, 1, 1] to player 2. This means I keep [3, 1, 3, 3, 3]. The value to me of this offer is:\n    3 * 19 + 1 * 13 + 3 * 90 + 3 * 62 + 3 * 82 = 57 + 13 + 270 + 186 + 246 = 772.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 5, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 3 + 88 x 1 + 32 x 5 + 19 x 1 + 63 x 4\n    which is 804 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 805. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

This means that a deal made in round 1 is worth 1.0, round 2 is worth 0.9, and round 3 is worth 0.81 to each player.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer Value:** The current offer is that I get [2, 0, 2, 2, 2].

This is still lower than my outside offer.\n    *Counteroffer C*: offer player 1 [0,0,1,0,0]. This means I will keep [4,1,4,4,4] and this will give me a value of 4*95 + 1*88+ 4*32 + 4*19+4*63 = 380+88+128+76+252=924\n    *Counteroffer D*: offer player 1 [1,0,0,0,0]. This means I will keep [3,1,5,4,4] and this will give me a value of 3*95 + 1*88+ 5*32 + 4*19+4*63 = 285+88+160+76+252=861\n    *Counteroffer E*: offer player 1 [0,0,0,0,1]. This means I will keep [4,1,5,4,3] and this will give me a value of 4*95+1*88+5*32+4*19+3*63=380+88+160+76+189 = 893\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n    *   The current offer of 538 is much less than my outside offer of 805, so I should not accept.\n    *   Counteroffer A yields 956, Counteroffer C yields 924, Counteroffer D yields 861, and Counteroffer E yields 893, all of which are better than the outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer because it is less than my outside offer (Mistake 4).\n*   I should not walk away as there are counteroffers I can make that are better than my outside offer (Mistake 5).\n*   I will propose counteroffer A which is to keep everything for myself and offer [0,0,0,0,0].

This means I keep [3, 1, 4, 3, 3].\n    *   Value of keeping items: (3 * 95) + (1 * 88) + (4 * 32) + (3 * 19) + (3 * 63) = 285 + 88 + 128 + 57 + 189 = 747\n    *   Discounted value of accepting current offer = 747 * 0.9 = 672.3\n\n*  **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that provides value greater than my outside offer of 805. Since this is round 2, I must achieve a value greater than 805/0.9 = 894.44.\n\n    * I will start by proposing a counter offer that gives Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], so that I keep all items [4, 1, 5, 4, 4]\n    *  Value of keeping all items: (4 * 95) + (1 * 88) + (5 * 32) + (4 * 19) + (4 * 63) = 380 + 88 + 160 + 76 + 252 = 956\n    *  Discounted value of this counter offer for me at round 2 is 956 * 0.9 = 860.4\n\n  *   Let's try another counteroffer.  Suppose I offer [1,0,1,1,0] to Player 1. This means I keep [3, 1, 4, 3, 4]\n    *   Value of keeping items: (3 * 95) + (1 * 88) + (4 * 32) + (3 * 19) + (4 * 63) = 285 + 88 + 128 + 57 + 252 = 810\n    *   Discounted value of this counter offer for me at round 2 is 810 * 0.9 = 729\n  *   Let's try another counteroffer.  Suppose I offer [0,0,0,0,1] to Player 1. This means I keep [4, 1, 5, 4, 3]\n    *   Value of keeping items: (4 * 95) + (1 * 88) + (5 * 32) + (4 * 19) + (3 * 63) = 380 + 88 + 160 + 76 + 189 = 893\n    *   Discounted value of this counter offer for me at round 2 is 893 * 0.9 = 803.7\n\n    *   Let's try a new counteroffer, to give away a few more items. I propose to offer [1, 0, 2, 1, 1]. This means I keep [3, 1, 3, 3, 3]\n        * Value of keeping items: (3 * 95) + (1 * 88) + (3 * 32) + (3 * 19) + (3 * 63) = 285 + 88 + 96 + 57 + 189 = 715\n        * Discounted value of this counter offer for me at round 2 is 715 * 0.9 = 643.5\n\n    I should offer [0,0,0,0,0] as this yields the highest value of 860.4 > 805\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer yields 672.3, which is less than my outside option of 805. I will not accept.\n*   Walking away gives me 805. \n*   Proposing a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] gives me 860.4, which is greater than both accepting and walking away.\n\nTherefore, I should propose the counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 1 + 13 x 1 + 90 x 2 + 62 x 0 + 82 x 2\n    which is 376 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 377. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\nThe current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning Player 2 is offering me nothing. If I accept this offer, I get 0 items of each type, which is worth 0.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer value:** Accepting [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] yields a value of 0.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer (adjusted for the discount rate). Since this is round 3 and player 2 is not offering me anything, I could attempt to propose a very small number of items for them, and keep the rest. I want my counteroffer to exceed the discounted outside offer (377 * 0.81 = 305.37).\n\nLet's consider keeping the majority of items and make a counteroffer to player 2: [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] (offer them 1 item of 1, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 1 of item 5). This means I keep 3 items of item 1, 1 item of item 2, 4 items of item 3, 3 items of item 4 and 3 items of item 5. My value would be:\n(3 * 19) + (1 * 13) + (4 * 90) + (3 * 62) + (3 * 82) = 57 + 13 + 360 + 186 + 246 = 862. This is better than my discounted outside offer value of 305.37.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of 0 is terrible for me, and is worse than my outside offer, hence I will not accept. If I walk away, I receive the outside offer, which is 377. Given that it is round 3, and Player 2 has been offering nothing the last two rounds, I cannot expect them to improve their offer. If they offer anything in the last round, that is treated as a walk.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 328. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 576 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    44 x 0 + 8 x 2 + 86 x 1 + 9 x 5 + 45 x 4\n    which is 327 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 328. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best course of action for Player 1 in round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 328\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 44\n    *   Item 2: 8\n    *   Item 3: 86\n    *   Item 4: 9\n    *   Item 5: 45\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 8 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 7 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting a deal in round 2 will result in a payoff multiplied by 0.9, and in round 3 by 0.9^2. This encourages earlier deals.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table. This means we cannot assess its value and must either walk or make a counteroffer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** We need to propose a division of items.  Let's start by trying to calculate the total value of keeping all the items to ourselves. This should be the maximum possible value we could obtain from an agreement.\n    * 1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 44 = 44\n    * 8 units of item 2 = 8 * 8 = 64\n    * 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 86 = 172\n    * 7 units of item 4 = 7 * 9 = 63\n    * 4 units of item 5 = 4 * 45 = 180\n    * Total value: 44 + 64 + 172 + 63 + 180 = 523\n\n   We have 523 as the maximum possible payoff from an agreement. Since our outside offer is 328, we know that any counteroffer we make needs to result in us keeping items valued more than 328. Let's consider the possibility of offering an equal number of items to the other player, and adjust from there. Since some items do not divide easily, we will try this initial offer and adjust.\n\n   Let's offer the following to Player 2:\n      - Item 1: 0\n      - Item 2: 4\n      - Item 3: 1\n      - Item 4: 3\n      - Item 5: 2\n      \n   This means we keep:\n      - Item 1: 1\n      - Item 2: 4\n      - Item 3: 1\n      - Item 4: 4\n      - Item 5: 2\n\n   Value of kept items = (1 * 44) + (4 * 8) + (1 * 86) + (4 * 9) + (2 * 45) = 44 + 32 + 86 + 36 + 90 = 288.\n\n    This is less than our outside option. Therefore this counter offer is not valid (mistake #2).  Let's try a different division.\n\n   Let's try offering the following to Player 2:\n      - Item 1: 0\n      - Item 2: 2\n      - Item 3: 0\n      - Item 4: 1\n      - Item 5: 1\n      \n   This means we keep:\n      - Item 1: 1\n      - Item 2: 6\n      - Item 3: 2\n      - Item 4: 6\n      - Item 5: 3\n    \n    Value of kept items: (1 * 44) + (6 * 8) + (2 * 86) + (6 * 9) + (3 * 45) = 44 + 48 + 172 + 54 + 135 = 453. This is a valid offer since it exceeds the outside value of 328.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nBased on our analysis, here's what we should do:\n\n*   We will not walk away, since a counter offer is available with a better value than our outside option\n*   We will not accept, since there is no current offer.\n*   We will make the counteroffer calculated above, since it is the first valid counteroffer that exceeds our outside option.\n\nTherefore, we will make the counteroffer of [0, 2, 0, 1, 1].\nOur value for keeping the remaining items would be 453, which is greater than our outside offer of 328.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    44 x 0 + 8 x 2 + 86 x 1 + 9 x 5 + 45 x 4\n    which is 327 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 328. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 328. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 44\n    *   Item 2: 8\n    *   Item 3: 86\n    *   Item 4: 9\n    *   Item 5: 45\n*   **Total item pool:** 1 unit of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of accepting it in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer (Player 2 offers me):** [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for the current offer: 0 * 44 + 1 * 8 + 0 * 86 + 0 * 9 + 0 * 45 = 8\n    *   Since this value (8) is much lower than my outside offer of 328 and it's also lower than what I would expect from a fair deal, I should definitely not accept it.\n\n*   **My previous offer to Player 2 in Round 1:** [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]. This means I kept [1, 6, 2, 6, 3] for myself.\n        My value: 1*44 + 6*8 + 2*86 + 6*9 + 3*45 = 44 + 48 + 172 + 54 + 135 = 453. This value was multiplied by 1 in round 1.\n    My current value if I were to accept player 2's offer would be 8, which will be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to come up with a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer of 328.\n\nLet's consider several counteroffers. I'll try to offer the player 2, more of what they seem to want: item 2 and then try to keep more of items 3 and 5 which I value highly.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 1 (offer more item 2):** [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. I keep: [1, 5, 2, 7, 4].\n    *   My value: 1*44 + 5*8 + 2*86 + 7*9 + 4*45 = 44 + 40 + 172 + 63 + 180 = 499. Discounted value: 499*0.9 = 449.1 > 328 (outside offer)\n\n*   **Counteroffer 2 (offer more item 2 and item 4):** [0, 3, 0, 1, 0] . I keep: [1, 5, 2, 6, 4].\n    *   My value: 1*44 + 5*8 + 2*86 + 6*9 + 4*45 = 44 + 40 + 172 + 54 + 180 = 490. Discounted value: 490*0.9 = 441 > 328\n\n*   **Counteroffer 3 (offer some of each item):** [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]. I keep: [1, 6, 1, 6, 3].\n    *   My value: 1*44 + 6*8 + 1*86 + 6*9 + 3*45 = 44 + 48 + 86 + 54 + 135 = 367. Discounted value: 367*0.9 = 330.3 > 328\n\nCounteroffer 3 still beats my outside offer and offers the player more of an item that is more valuable to me.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n*   I will make a counteroffer. Counteroffer 3 gives me a discounted value of 330.3, which is greater than my outside offer. This is an improvement.\n*   I want to offer [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 0 + 28 x 0 + 49 x 0 + 35 x 1 + 90 x 5\n    which is 485 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 486.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 0 + 28 x 0 + 49 x 0 + 35 x 1 + 90 x 5\n    which is 485 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 486. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since this is round 2, the discount factor is gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I would get all items.\n    *   My value for this offer:\n        *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 29 = 29\n        *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 28 = 56\n        *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 49 = 98\n        *   6 units of item 4: 6 * 35 = 210\n        *   6 units of item 5: 6 * 90 = 540\n        *   Total value: 29 + 56 + 98 + 210 + 540 = 933\n    *   Discounted value: 933 * 0.9 = 839.7\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   I need to consider what would be a reasonable counteroffer.  It's not useful to accept the current offer (which gives me everything), but I can't make an offer that gives me less than my outside option. Given there are 5 items, and the player 2's previous offer was [0,0,0,0,0], a reasonable starting point is to propose to split the items evenly or at least in some fashion that would not make it obviously the same offer. I need a counteroffer that results in a discounted value higher than 486.\n    *   Let's try a split of [0,1,1,3,3], which keeps for me [1,1,1,3,3].\n         *   My value if I offer the other party [0,1,1,3,3]:\n              * 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 29 = 29\n              * 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 28 = 28\n              * 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 49 = 49\n              * 3 unit of item 4: 3 * 35 = 105\n              * 3 unit of item 5: 3 * 90 = 270\n              * Total value: 29 + 28 + 49 + 105 + 270 = 481\n        *  Discounted value: 481 * 0.9 = 432.9. This is less than my outside offer, so I cannot propose this.\n    * Let's try offering the other party [0, 0, 1, 2, 2].\n          *  My value if I offer the other party [0, 0, 1, 2, 2]:\n              * 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 29 = 29\n              * 2 unit of item 2: 2 * 28 = 56\n              * 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 49 = 49\n              * 4 unit of item 4: 4 * 35 = 140\n              * 4 unit of item 5: 4 * 90 = 360\n              * Total Value: 29 + 56 + 49 + 140 + 360 = 634\n          * Discounted value: 634 * 0.9 = 570.6.  This is better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] yields a discounted value of 839.7.\n*   Offering [0, 0, 1, 2, 2] yields a discounted value of 570.6.\n*   I should not walk away as I have not yet considered all possibilities.\n*   Since I have not made any mistakes and I should propose an offer that is more favorable, I will offer [0, 0, 1, 2, 2]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 486. This is my guaranteed fallback if we don't reach an agreement.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 29\n    *   Item 2: 28\n    *   Item 3: 49\n    *   Item 4: 35\n    *   Item 5: 90\n*   **Total item pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 6 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 3, the discount factor to apply to the final value is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81. This means accepting a deal now is less valuable than the same deal in a previous round. However, if we walk, that is equivalent to a round 3 deal with no discount.\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer on the table is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would get all of the items, so my value is what I calculated as the total value of all items in the introduction which is 933.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Value of current offer:** If I accept [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], I would receive all of the items.  My value is therefore \n    (1 * 29) + (2 * 28) + (2 * 49) + (6 * 35) + (6 * 90) = 29 + 56 + 98 + 210 + 540 = 933. This value would be discounted by the discount factor at the current round 0.81. Therefore the value if we accept would be 933 * 0.81 = 755.73\n*   **Value of walking away:** If I walk away, I get my outside offer, which is 486 and no discount is applied.\n*   **Value of potential counteroffers:** Since it is round 3, I could make a counteroffer, but it will be ignored by player 2 and they will walk away. Therefore I won't analyze this any further.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The value of accepting the current offer after the discount factor (755.73) is greater than my outside offer (486).\n*   Since this is round 3, if player 2 were to make a counter offer it would be treated as a walk. I therefore should accept the offer as it provides me with the greatest payoff.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 447. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 741 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 0 + 40 x 0 + 15 x 1 + 64 x 4 + 35 x 5\n    which is 446 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 447. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step and determine the optimal action for Player 1 in round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 447\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 93\n    *   Item 2: 40\n    *   Item 3: 15\n    *   Item 4: 64\n    *   Item 5: 35\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 4\n    *   Item 5: 12\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1, so there is no reduction in value for any negotiation outcome this round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what offers I could make to Player 2 while ensuring I retain at least 447 worth of value. This requires experimenting with some potential offers and calculating their value.\n    Let's start with an equal division, which is not possible, as we can only give away whole numbers of items to Player 2, so instead lets do a close approximation to an equal division by giving player 2 half of all the available items in each category (rounding up if necessary):\n        * Offer [2, 2, 2, 2, 6] to Player 2, keep the rest.\n        * Keep [1, 2, 2, 2, 6]\n        * 1 * 93 + 2 * 40 + 2 * 15 + 2 * 64 + 6 * 35 = 93 + 80 + 30 + 128 + 210 = 541. Since 541 is greater than our outside offer we should proceed by checking if another alternative would give us a better payoff.\n    Let us try offering an increasing number of each item to player 2:\n        * Offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n        * Keep [2, 3, 3, 3, 11]\n        * 2*93 + 3*40 + 3*15 + 3*64 + 11*35 = 186+120+45+192+385 = 928 (Good offer as 928 > 447)\n        * Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n        * Keep [3, 4, 4, 4, 12]\n        * 3*93 + 4*40 + 4*15 + 4*64 + 12*35 = 279 + 160 + 60 + 256 + 420 = 1175\n        * Offer [1, 2, 2, 2, 6]\n        * Keep [2, 2, 2, 2, 6]\n        * 2*93 + 2*40 + 2*15 + 2*64 + 6*35 = 186 + 80 + 30 + 128 + 210 = 634\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince this is the first round, I should propose an offer to player 2, but I want to try and keep as much value as I can for myself, so my best play would be to offer [1,2,2,2,6], which gives me a value of 634. \nLet's test giving a little less. Try offering [1,1,1,1,1] which gave us 928 in the calculations above, which is better than 634.\nLet's try offering [0,0,0,0,0] which gives us our total value which is 1175, this offer will be declined by player 2, but it might provide a strategic advantage to me to be so aggressive from the start.\n\nSince player 2 is going to act reasonably, we know that they will likely try to get a deal which gives them at least an offer above their outside offer. Thus, if I offer them [1,1,1,1,1] I am offering them all the items they are going to likely try to negotiate to get (as I assume they will use the same reasoning as me), but this is also better than offering them zero items. Therefore, it would make sense to offer them [1,1,1,1,1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 184. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 618 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 0 + 34 x 1 + 25 x 2 + 44 x 1 + 53 x 1\n    which is 181 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 184. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1 in the first round.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 184. This is my guaranteed fallback position.\n*   **Item Values:** My per-unit values are:\n    *   Item 1: 50\n    *   Item 2: 34\n    *   Item 3: 25\n    *   Item 4: 44\n    *   Item 5: 53\n*   **Total Item Pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 6 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*  **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9.  This means that an offer accepted in round 2 will be worth 90% of its value, and an offer accepted in round 3 will be worth 81% of its value. The value of accepting in round 1 is not discounted.\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Since there is no current offer, I cannot calculate the value of accepting.\n*  **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to construct a counteroffer that is worth more to me than my outside offer. A counteroffer represents how many of each item I offer to Player 2 (meaning I keep the rest). It must include a valid number of items according to the item pools available. Let's consider a few options, keeping in mind we want to maximize our value but also start with a reasonable offer to avoid walking away. Remember that if the other agent makes a counteroffer in the final round it is treated as if they WALK, this means it is advantageous to make a deal before the last round.\n   * Offer 1: [2, 1, 0, 0, 2] (offer 2 units of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 2 of item 5 to Player 2).\n       * I keep: [4, 3, 2, 1, 4]\n       * My Value: (4 * 50) + (3 * 34) + (2 * 25) + (1 * 44) + (4 * 53) = 200 + 102 + 50 + 44 + 212 = 608\n       * This is better than my outside offer of 184.\n   * Offer 2: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n        * I keep [5,4,2,1,5]\n        * My value: (5 * 50) + (4 * 34) + (2 * 25) + (1 * 44) + (5 * 53) = 250 + 136 + 50 + 44 + 265 = 745\n        * This is better than my outside offer of 184, but might be too generous to my opponent.\n   * Let's consider an offer that is more beneficial to us, but still not too extreme to start with: Offer 3: [3, 2, 1, 0, 3]\n       * I keep [3, 2, 1, 1, 3]\n       * My Value: (3 * 50) + (2 * 34) + (1 * 25) + (1 * 44) + (3 * 53) = 150 + 68 + 25 + 44 + 159 = 446\n       * This is better than my outside offer.\n   * Let's try an even better one: Offer 4: [4, 3, 1, 0, 4]\n        * I keep [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n        * My Value: 100 + 34 + 25 + 44 + 106 = 309\n        * This is better than my outside offer.\n\n    It appears as if it would be beneficial to make a counteroffer in the first round. Let's choose offer 3 to begin as a reasonable starting point. We can iterate on that as the game continues if we don't get acceptance.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will make a COUNTEROFFER with the items specified in offer 3 to Player 2.\n   *  Offering [3, 2, 1, 0, 3] to Player 2, which allows me to keep [3, 2, 1, 1, 3].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 1, 0, 3]}\n```\n",

My value: 4 * 36 + 3 * 70 + 1 * 24 + 1 * 40 + 4 * 2 = 144 + 210 + 24 + 40 + 8 = 426.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 1, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 184\n*   **My item values:** 50 for item 1, 34 for item 2, 25 for item 3, 44 for item 4, 53 for item 5.\n*   **Total pool of items:** 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in the current round (round 2) will yield a value multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [2, 1, 1, 0, 2].  This means I keep 6-2=4 of item 1, 4-1=3 of item 2, 2-1=1 of item 3, 1-0=1 of item 4, and 6-2=4 of item 5. The value for me is:\n    (4 * 50) + (3 * 34) + (1 * 25) + (1 * 44) + (4 * 53) = 200 + 102 + 25 + 44 + 212 = 583\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 583 * 0.9 = 524.7. This is much better than my outside offer value of 184.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Before I look at potential counteroffers, I can already see that the current offer is quite good. Let's consider a potential counteroffer which is more favorable to myself. I should always offer player 2 at least 0 of each item in order to not make mistake 3. Let's try offering player 2 1 unit of items 1, 2 and 5, and 0 of items 3 and 4: [1,1,0,0,1]. This means I get 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 5 units of item 5. The value for me is:\n     (5 * 50) + (3 * 34) + (2 * 25) + (1 * 44) + (5 * 53) = 250 + 102 + 50 + 44 + 265 = 711\n    The discounted value in round 2 is 711 * 0.9 = 639.9, so even if I were able to get this accepted, it is not much better than the 524.7 value I'd get from accepting the current offer.\n     Let's try an offer that does not seem very reasonable but might be worth exploring. I will try [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].  This means I get 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 6 units of item 5. The value for me is:\n      (6 * 50) + (4 * 34) + (2 * 25) + (1 * 44) + (6 * 53) = 300 + 136 + 50 + 44 + 318 = 848\n    The discounted value in round 2 is 848 * 0.9 = 763.2. This is much more than the current deal, but player 2 will most likely walk away if I offer this. Since the negotiation is already in round 2, and I am player 1, I will not risk the deal and the high value of the current offer, and therefore I will not walk away from the current offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer gives me a discounted value of 524.7, which is greater than my outside offer of 184, and it's a good deal in general.\n*   The potential counteroffers explored don't offer a significantly better outcome given they might not be accepted. It would be too risky to try and get something much better at this stage in the negotiation.\n\nTherefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 500. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 500. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that any deal reached in later rounds is worth less in present value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer, i.e. decide how many items to offer Player 2.  My objective is to keep more valuable items, while still being generous enough that they may accept. I need to make sure that whatever I keep is worth more than my outside offer, or I will be better off walking. Let's consider a range of offers, calculating their value for me. Let's also consider what happens if we offer equal divisions.\n\n  * Equal division means offering [1,1,2,2,1] - let's calculate what that leaves for me:\n    [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] = 2 * 81 + 2 * 84 + 2 * 69 + 2 * 6 + 2 * 51 = 162 + 168 + 138 + 12 + 102 = 584. This is greater than my outside offer, so this is ok. \n  * I could be more aggressive. Let's try offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n      My values = 3*81 + 3*84 + 4*69 + 4*6 + 3*51 = 243 + 252 + 276 + 24 + 153 = 948. This is much better than my outside offer. But would the other player ever accept this? Probably not.\n  * Let's consider an offer where I am more generous in items that are less valuable to me, such as item 4.\n        Offer [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]. My values = 3*81 + 3*84 + 4*69 + 0*6 + 3*51 = 243 + 252 + 276 + 153 = 924 which is better than my outside offer.\n  * Let's try an offer with some of each item, but less than half of each:  Offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. My value = 2*81+2*84+3*69+3*6+2*51 = 162+168+207+18+102= 657, which is greater than my outside offer.\n    \nI want to be generous enough that the other player might accept, but not so generous that I am worse off than my outside offer. I will aim for a roughly equal split in the most valuable items but I'll keep a larger amount of my most valuable items. Let's try offering [1, 1, 2, 2, 1] as a starting offer. This is a reasonable starting point.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer of [1, 1, 2, 2, 1].

Since it's round 1, the discount factor doesn't yet apply (0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1).  It will come into play in subsequent rounds if we don't reach a deal this round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [1, 1, 2, 2, 1], meaning I receive 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5.

Let's do that.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 514, which is less than my outside offer of 971.\n*  The counteroffer of [0,0,0,0,1] gives me a value of 1136, which is above my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 500. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 0 + 84 x 3 + 69 x 1 + 6 x 4 + 51 x 3\n    which is 498 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 500. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 500\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 81, Item 2: 84, Item 3: 69, Item 4: 6, Item 5: 51\n*   **Total pool of items:** 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. We are in round 2, so the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means that any deal we make this round will be worth 90% of the same deal in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I would receive 1 unit of item 5. My value for this offer is 1 * 51 = 51.\n    Adjusting for discount factor, the present value of the offer is 51 * 0.9 = 45.9\n*   **Comparing to my outside offer:** My current offer value of 45.9 is significantly lower than my outside offer of 500. Accepting this would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer that gives me a value *greater* than my outside offer value, adjusted for the discount factor (500/0.9= 555.56 if offered this round). Let's start by seeing what my total value would be if I kept everything, and offer nothing:\n    - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 81 = 243\n    - 3 units of item 2: 3 * 84 = 252\n    - 4 units of item 3: 4 * 69 = 276\n    - 4 units of item 4: 4 * 6 = 24\n    - 3 units of item 5: 3 * 51 = 153\n    - Total value: 243 + 252 + 276 + 24 + 153 = 948\n    - Discounted value: 948 * 0.9 = 853.2\n    Since I know my maximum value, I'll aim for an offer that gets me most of it, and not make a mistake like mistake 2, by offering too much away. I'll try offering the same items as in the first round, [1, 1, 2, 2, 1], as Player 1 did, and keep the rest.\n    - My items: [3-1, 3-1, 4-2, 4-2, 3-1] = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n    - My value: 2 * 81 + 2 * 84 + 2 * 69 + 2 * 6 + 2 * 51 = 162 + 168 + 138 + 12 + 102 = 584\n    - Discounted value: 584 * 0.9 = 525.6. This is better than my outside offer if accepted this round but not better than it would have been if accepted last round\n    This is better than my outside offer of 500, even after discounting, which would be 500/0.9 = 555.56.\n\n* I want to offer a bit more to keep the negotiation alive for a bit and to make sure it is not immediately rejected.\n    Let's try offering [1, 1, 2, 3, 2]\n    - My items: [3-1, 3-1, 4-2, 4-3, 3-2] = [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n    - My value: 2 * 81 + 2 * 84 + 2 * 69 + 1 * 6 + 1 * 51 = 162 + 168 + 138 + 6 + 51 = 525\n    - Discounted value: 525 * 0.9 = 472.5. This is worse than my outside offer. I'll try an offer that is better than this.\n    Let's try offering [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n    - My items: [3-0, 3-0, 4-1, 4-1, 3-1] = [3, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n    - My value: 3*81+3*84+3*69+3*6+2*51 = 243 + 252 + 207 + 18 + 102 = 822\n    - Discounted value: 822*0.9 = 739.8. This is better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible.\n*   Walking away would give me 500.\n*   Offering [0, 0, 1, 1, 1] gives me 739.8 if accepted. This is the best option.\n\n**Action:**\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 4 + 50 x 0 + 99 x 0 + 22 x 0 + 51 x 1\n    which is 63 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 65. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step and determine my optimal action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 65\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 50\n    *   Item 3: 99\n    *   Item 4: 22\n    *   Item 5: 51\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6\n    *   Item 2: 5\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 6\n    *   Item 5: 7\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.  The discount factor becomes relevant in subsequent rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so there is no value to assess.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what offers I could make. I need to propose an offer that gives some of the items to player 2 and keeps some for myself. I also need to calculate the value of that offer to me, and make sure that it exceeds my outside offer value.\n\n    Let's start by considering an offer where I keep most of the high-value items and give away the lower-value ones. A potential initial offer is to offer 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 to the other player. The remaining items (4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5) go to me. The value to me would be:\n    * 4 * 3 + 5 * 50 + 4 * 99 + 4 * 22 + 5 * 51 = 12 + 250 + 396 + 88 + 255 = 1001\n\n    Since this is greater than my outside offer of 65, this is a viable offer. I can propose giving the other player 2 units of each of item 1, item 4, and item 5. This means I am keeping 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5. This results in a value of 1001, which is greater than my outside offer of 65, so it is a reasonable starting offer.\n\n    Before making my decision, let's consider another possibility: what happens if I give away more? What if I offer 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. This would leave me with:\n    * 3 units of item 1: 3 * 3 = 9\n    * 4 units of item 2: 4 * 50 = 200\n    * 4 units of item 3: 4 * 99 = 396\n    * 3 units of item 4: 3 * 22 = 66\n    * 4 units of item 5: 4 * 51 = 204\n    The total value to me would be 9 + 200 + 396 + 66 + 204 = 875. This is also above my outside offer.\n\n    Let's go with the first offer (2 of items 1,4, and 5) which gives me 1001.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is none. \n*   My outside offer is 65.\n*   The offer of [2, 0, 0, 2, 2] is an offer that provides me with a value of 1001, which is greater than my outside offer.\n*   I will make a counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

This round's discount factor will not play a role in our valuation yet, but will in future rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 0, 0, 2, 2].

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 4, 6, 7]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 4, 6, 7]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 65\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 50\n    *   Item 3: 99\n    *   Item 4: 22\n    *   Item 5: 51\n*   **Total item pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 6\n    *   Item 2: 5\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 6\n    *   Item 5: 7\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, if we make a deal, its value will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [2, 1, 4, 6, 7].  This means they are keeping [4, 4, 0, 0, 0]. My value for this offer is:\n    *   2 * 3 + 1 * 50 + 4 * 99 + 6 * 22 + 7 * 51 = 6 + 50 + 396 + 132 + 357 = 941\n    *   Since we are on round 2, we need to discount this by 0.9: 941 * 0.9 = 846.9\n*    This is much better than my outside offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider an offer where I try to get more of the high value items 2, 3 and 5. Let's try to get as much as I can without making a mistake. \n    * Lets keep 3 units of item 2 and 2 units of item 3. To calculate what we need to offer the other player to keep this:\n        * Item 1: we will offer them 6 -0 = 6\n        * Item 2: we will offer them 5 - 3 = 2\n        * Item 3: we will offer them 4 - 2 = 2\n        * Item 4: we will offer them 6 - 0 = 6\n        * Item 5: we will offer them 7- 0 = 7\n    * My value would be :\n         0 * 3 + 3 * 50 + 2 * 99 + 0 * 22 + 0 * 51 = 0+150+198+0+0 = 348\n    *  Since we are on round 2, we need to discount this by 0.9 : 348 * 0.9 = 313.2\n    * This is much better than my outside offer of 65 so is a possible counter offer\n     * To be sure to avoid mistake 2. Lets try a very modest offer to see if we are better than the outside offer. If i kept only 1 of item 2 and 1 of item 3, I would be in a better place than my outside offer. \n        * Item 1: we will offer them 6 -0 = 6\n        * Item 2: we will offer them 5 - 1 = 4\n        * Item 3: we will offer them 4 - 1 = 3\n        * Item 4: we will offer them 6 - 0 = 6\n        * Item 5: we will offer them 7 - 0 = 7\n        My value for this offer:\n        * 0 * 3 + 1 * 50 + 1 * 99 + 0 * 22 + 0 * 51 = 0 + 50 + 99 + 0 + 0= 149\n        * 149 * 0.9 = 134.1\n         This is better than my outside offer\n        * This should be a safe bet to avoid making any mistakes so lets stick with this.\n    \n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is valued at 846.9, which is much higher than my outside offer of 65. The counter offer I made is also worth more than 65. Based on the above analysis, the best strategy is to ACCEPT the current offer because it will provide the most value for me.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 9. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 684 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 17 x 0 + 33 x 0 + 57 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 9. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 9\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 39\n    *   Item 2: 82\n    *   Item 3: 17\n    *   Item 4: 33\n    *   Item 5: 57\n*   **Total items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 2\n    *   Item 4: 4\n    *   Item 5: 1\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1\n    My value for this offer: (2 * 39) + (3 * 82) + (2 * 17) + (3 * 33) + (1 * 57) = 78 + 246 + 34 + 99 + 57 = 514\n    Adjusted value after the discount rate: 514 * 0.9 = 462.6.\n    This offer is better than my outside offer of 9.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider some potential counteroffers. I want to make sure any offer I propose is better than my outside option, but not worse than any previous offer (mistake 1), and doesn't involve offering all or no items (mistake 3).\n\n    Let's analyze offering 1 less item of each type compared to the current offer (and keep one more of each):\n    \n        If I keep [1, 2, 1, 2, 0], and offer [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]:\n    My value would be: (1*39) + (2*82) + (1*17) + (2*33) + (0*57) = 39 + 164 + 17 + 66 + 0 = 286\n    286 * 0.9 = 257.4 which is much better than my outside offer of 9.\n\n    If I keep [2, 3, 2, 3, 1], and offer [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] (which is my current offer from Player 2):\n    My value would be: (2*39) + (3*82) + (2*17) + (3*33) + (1*57) = 78 + 246 + 34 + 99 + 57= 514\n    514 * 0.9 = 462.6, which we already know is good for me, and better than my outside option of 9.\n\n     If I keep [1, 3, 1, 3, 0], and offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]:\n        My value is: (1*39) + (3*82) + (1*17) + (3*33) + (0*57) = 39 + 246 + 17 + 99 + 0 = 401\n        401 * 0.9 = 360.9, which is still good and better than my outside option of 9, but worse than keeping the current offer.\n\n    I will propose a counteroffer that yields a better value than both my outside option and previous rounds, with the goal to optimize my outcome without being overly greedy.\n\n    Let's try keeping 1 less than the current offer:\n    My counter offer will give Player 2 [1, 2, 1, 2, 0]\n    Which means I keep [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n    My value if I keep these is: (1*39) + (2*82) + (1*17) + (2*33) + (1*57) = 39+164+17+66+57=343\n    343 * 0.9 = 308.7\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer yields a value of 462.6, which is excellent and much greater than my outside offer of 9. My counteroffer yields a value of 308.7, which is better than my outside offer, but still worse than accepting the current offer. There is no need to counter offer at this time, as it would be detrimental. I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 3, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 3 + 74 x 5 + 29 x 3 + 47 x 1 + 27 x 4\n    which is 621 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 627. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 627\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 74, Item 3: 29, Item 4: 47, Item 5: 27\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round results in a lower total value due to the discount.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    My value for this offer is: (0 * 3) + (1 * 74) + (0 * 29) + (0 * 47) + (1 * 27) = 74 + 27 = 101.\n*   **Value of Current offer, discounted:** Since this is Round 1, there is no discount. 101 * 0.9^(1-1) = 101.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what I can offer that would both be better for me than my outside offer and also potentially acceptable to Player 1. I need to offer Player 1 some items and retain some items for myself. I'll start by trying to keep the items I value more highly and offer more items that I value less. I want to make a counteroffer that gives player 1 some items, but keeps enough for myself that it is higher value than my outside offer. I will start by assuming I keep all of Item 2 and all of Item 4. I will also want to keep as much of Item 3 and Item 5 as possible, but perhaps offer Player 1 1 of each to make it look like a real offer and get the negotiation started. Let's propose to give the other player 1 of each item, except Item 2 and Item 4. I keep the rest. That is: I offer them [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]. This means I keep [2, 5, 2, 2, 3]. My value would be: (2 * 3) + (5 * 74) + (2 * 29) + (2 * 47) + (3 * 27) = 6 + 370 + 58 + 94 + 81 = 609. This is less than my outside offer of 627.\n\nLet's try keeping 3 units of Item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5. My value would be 3 * 3 + 4 * 74 + 2 * 29 + 2 * 47 + 3 * 27 = 9 + 296 + 58 + 94 + 81 = 538. This is too low.\n\nLet's try keeping 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 3 units of item 5. This is giving [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]. My value would be 3 * 3 + 5 * 74 + 2 * 29 + 1 * 47 + 3 * 27 = 9 + 370 + 58 + 47 + 81 = 565. Still too low.\n\nLet's try keeping 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5. This is giving [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]. My value would be 2 * 3 + 5 * 74 + 2 * 29 + 2 * 47 + 3 * 27 = 6 + 370 + 58 + 94 + 81 = 609. Still too low.\n\nLet's try keeping 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5. This is giving [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]. My value would be 2 * 3 + 5 * 74 + 3 * 29 + 2 * 47 + 3 * 27 = 6 + 370 + 87 + 94 + 81 = 638. This is greater than the outside offer! So I will propose this. \n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of 101 is less than my outside offer of 627. I will make a counteroffer.\nMy counteroffer is that I give Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

We have total items 3, 5, 3, 2, and 4. This means giving all items to player 2 is [3,5,3,2,4]. I will consider a few options, focusing on keeping the higher-value items.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step and decide on the best action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 627\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 74, Item 3: 29, Item 4: 47, Item 5: 27\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of Item 1: 1 * 3 = 3\n    *   2 units of Item 2: 2 * 74 = 148\n    *   1 unit of Item 3: 1 * 29 = 29\n    *   1 unit of Item 4: 1 * 47 = 47\n    *   2 units of Item 5: 2 * 27 = 54\n    *   **Total value of current offer:** 3 + 148 + 29 + 47 + 54 = 281\n    *  **Discounted Value of current offer**: 281 * 0.9 = 252.9\n    *   This is way less than my outside option of 627, and accepting this would be Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *  Since it is round 2, I must now consider that if I offer a counter offer I will need to make it a good offer because that will be the end of the negotiation if they reject it or if I accept their counter offer.\n\n    *   Let's start with seeing if giving them [1, 0, 0, 0, 1] is a better counter offer.\n        *  My take: [2, 5, 3, 2, 3].\n        *  Value for me:  2 * 3 + 5 * 74 + 3 * 29 + 2 * 47 + 3 * 27 = 606. This is discounted to 606 * 0.9 = 545.4. This is still less than my outside offer, and thus would be Mistake 2.\n\n    *  Let's try to take all of the item 2, which has the highest value for me, and give all of the lower value items. [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n        * My take: [1, 5, 1, 1, 2]\n        * Value for me: 1 * 3 + 5 * 74 + 1 * 29 + 1 * 47 + 2 * 27 = 521. This is discounted to 521 * 0.9 = 468.9. Still a bad idea\n\n    *  Lets try offering almost everything to player 1 and see if that is better for me: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. \n        * My take: [3, 4, 3, 2, 4]\n        * Value for me: 3 * 3 + 4 * 74 + 3 * 29 + 2 * 47 + 4 * 27 = 576. This is discounted to 576 * 0.9 = 518.4. Still not good enough.\n\n    *   Let's try offering a very minimal counter offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This would avoid mistake 3, but it may not get accepted.\n        * My take: [3, 5, 3, 2, 4]\n        * Value for me: 3*3 + 5*74 + 3*29 + 2*47 + 4*27 = 668. This is discounted to 668 * 0.9 = 601.2. Not great.\n\n    * I think giving them all the item 1 and 3, and none of 2 might be better for me [3, 0, 3, 0, 0].\n        * My take: [0, 5, 0, 2, 4]\n        * Value for me: 0*3 + 5*74 + 0*29 + 2*47 + 4*27 = 499. Discounted: 499*0.9 = 449.1. Not good enough.\n\n    * I think keeping all item 2 and 4 might be better [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n        * My take: [3, 5, 3, 2, 4]\n        * Value for me: 3*3 + 5*74 + 3*29 + 2*47 + 4*27 = 668. Discounted: 668 * 0.9 = 601.2. Not good enough.\n\n    * I think the best thing to do is to give them as little as possible. Thus [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is the best counter offer to propose and it will lead to a discounted value of 601.2.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth less than my outside option.\n*   My outside offer is 627. \n*   All the counter offers above that give me a share of the items provide a discounted value below my outside option.\n*  Because this is the last round, If I counter offer and the player rejects it, I get my outside offer of 627, but I should try to negotiate a deal if possible.\n*   Because of this, I should make my best counter offer of giving them [0,0,0,0,0] items, and hope they accept.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 108. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 108. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 564 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 0 + 71 x 0 + 19 x 0 + 46 x 1 + 20 x 3\n    which is 106 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 108. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 73. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 73. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 633 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 3 + 95 x 0 + 20 x 1 + 61 x 0 + 27 x 1\n    which is 71 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 73. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 73\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 8, Item 2: 95, Item 3: 20, Item 4: 61, Item 5: 27\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1. This means that current value is not discounted.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offered me [1, 2, 1, 2, 2] of each item type. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 8 = 8\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 95 = 190\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 20 = 20\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 61 = 122\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 27 = 54\n    *   **Total value of accepting current offer:** 8 + 190 + 20 + 122 + 54 = 394\n    *   **Discounted Value:** 394 * 1 = 394\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few options (keeping in mind my outside offer of 73):\n\n    *   **Option 1:**  Keep [2, 2, 2, 3, 3] for myself, giving [1, 2, 1, 2, 2] to player 1. My value: (2 * 8) + (2 * 95) + (2 * 20) + (3 * 61) + (3 * 27) = 16 + 190 + 40 + 183 + 81 = 510\n        Since the offer to the other player is the same as the current offer, I should make a different offer.\n    *   **Option 2:**  Keep [3, 3, 3, 5, 5] for myself, giving [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] to player 1. My value: (3 * 8) + (3 * 95) + (3 * 20) + (5 * 61) + (5 * 27) = 24 + 285 + 60 + 305 + 135= 809\n    *   **Option 3:** Keep [2, 4, 2, 3, 3] for myself and give [1, 0, 1, 2, 2]. My value: 2 * 8 + 4 * 95 + 2 * 20 + 3 * 61 + 3 * 27 = 16+380+40+183+81=700\n    *  **Option 4** Keep [1,3,1,3,3] giving [2,1,2,2,2]. 1*8+3*95+1*20+3*61+3*27=8+285+20+183+81 = 577\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Accepting the current offer (394) is significantly better than my outside offer (73).\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 394, which is greater than my outside offer of 73.  It seems sensible, and a counteroffer would only delay the outcome.\n    If I proposed a counteroffer that is beneficial to me, then the other player would have to reject it, since it would have a lower value to them.\n    Therefore, it's sensible to accept the offer.\n    \n    \n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 333. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1218 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 0 + 66 x 0 + 88 x 3 + 67 x 1 + 94 x 0\n    which is 331 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 333. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n\n    My value for this offer would be:\n    2 * 91 + 2 * 66 + 4 * 88 + 3 * 67 + 4 * 94 = 182 + 132 + 352 + 201 + 376 = 1243\n    This is the value without discounting.  With the discount, it becomes 1243 * 0.9 = 1118.7\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    I need a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, which means it needs to have a value greater than 333.

This is good.\n\n    Let's calculate my value if I were to keep all items:\n    3 * 91 + 2 * 66 + 5 * 88 + 4 * 67 + 4 * 94 = 273 + 132 + 440 + 268 + 376 = 1489.\n     Discounted value: 1489 * 0.9 = 1340.1\n\n     Since I can get 1118.7 by accepting, and my outside option is 333, I should not walk away.\n\n   Let's see what happens if I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This is a possible move.\n    My value then is 1489.

If I were to make that offer now, my value would be 1218 * 0.9 = 1096.2.\n\nSince the discounted value of the current offer is better than my previous offer of [1,1,2,2,2] * 0.9, and it is already above my outside option, I should accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This means that accepting an offer in later rounds has a lower present value. I should aim for a good deal early on rather than delay.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since I have to make the first move, I need to evaluate potential counteroffers. I want to aim for a deal that is better than my outside offer, taking the discount factor into account. The discount factor is not relevant to the value at round 1, but it is relevant to making sure I don't make an offer which will make me want to wait for a future round.\n\n    Let's start with an offer that is very favorable to me: I keep most of the valuable items and offer less valuable items to Player 2. Specifically, I'll try offering Player 2 the following:\n    * Item 1: 2\n    * Item 2: 0\n    * Item 3: 1\n    * Item 4: 1\n    * Item 5: 2\n    \n    This means that I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 0\n    *   Item 4: 4\n    *   Item 5: 7\n\n    My value is then: \n    4 * 55 + 2 * 67 + 0 * 5 + 4 * 76 + 7 * 57 = 220 + 134 + 0 + 304 + 399 = 1057. This is lower than my outside offer of 1302. This is not an acceptable counteroffer. \n    Let's try a more generous offer to player 2:\n    * Item 1: 1\n    * Item 2: 0\n    * Item 3: 0\n    * Item 4: 1\n    * Item 5: 1\n    \n    This means that I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 1\n    *   Item 4: 4\n    *   Item 5: 8\n\n    My value is then: \n    5 * 55 + 2 * 67 + 1 * 5 + 4 * 76 + 8 * 57 = 275 + 134 + 5 + 304 + 456 = 1174. This is still less than my outside offer of 1302. This is not an acceptable counteroffer.\n    Let's try offering:\n     * Item 1: 0\n     * Item 2: 0\n     * Item 3: 0\n     * Item 4: 0\n     * Item 5: 0\n\n    This means that I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 6\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 1\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 9\n\n    My value is then: \n    6 * 55 + 2 * 67 + 1 * 5 + 5 * 76 + 9 * 57 = 330 + 134 + 5 + 380 + 513 = 1362. This is above my outside offer. This may be a viable counteroffer.\n    Let's try offering:\n     * Item 1: 1\n     * Item 2: 1\n     * Item 3: 0\n     * Item 4: 1\n     * Item 5: 1\n\n    This means that I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5\n    *   Item 2: 1\n    *   Item 3: 1\n    *   Item 4: 4\n    *   Item 5: 8\n\n    My value is then: \n    5 * 55 + 1 * 67 + 1 * 5 + 4 * 76 + 8 * 57 = 275 + 67 + 5 + 304 + 456 = 1107. This is less than my outside offer. This is not a good offer.\n\n    Based on this analysis, I should start by offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. \n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI should not accept the current offer as there is no current offer, and making a reasonable counteroffer gives a value larger than the outside option.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 765. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 765. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 942 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 0, 4, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    55 x 2 + 52 x 2 + 89 x 0 + 79 x 4 + 39 x 6\n    which is 764 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 765. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 765\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 55, Item 2: 52, Item 3: 89, Item 4: 79, Item 5: 39\n*   **Total items:** 6 units of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 9 of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that if the negotiation continues to round 2, the value of the outcome will be multiplied by 0.9. Round 3 will multiply by 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning Player 1 offers me nothing. If I accept this, I would receive 0 value. This is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to come up with a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. I need to keep enough items to achieve this.\n\nLet me calculate the value of keeping all items for myself, and offering nothing:\n(6 * 55) + (2 * 52) + (1 * 89) + (5 * 79) + (9 * 39) = 330 + 104 + 89 + 395 + 351 = 1269\n\nThis is clearly better than my outside offer of 765, as is any offer where I receive some items and the total value is above 765. \n\nSince this is round 1, I should make a counteroffer, rather than walking away (which would give me my outside offer, only discounted by 0.9^0 = 1, and there is still the potential for more value in a second round if I don't make a bad offer). I also don't want to accept the current offer, as it is worth 0.\n\nI'll start by offering something, rather than offering everything to player 1 or nothing. Let's make an offer where I keep most of the items, but give something to Player 1, such as half of items 1, 2, 4, and 5 and no item 3. I will then calculate the value of what I keep. So I will offer Player 1 [3, 1, 0, 2, 4], meaning I keep [3, 1, 1, 3, 5]\n\nValue to me of this offer:\n(3 * 55) + (1 * 52) + (1 * 89) + (3 * 79) + (5 * 39) = 165 + 52 + 89 + 237 + 195 = 738.\nThis is worse than my outside offer, so I should modify it\n\nI will offer [2, 0, 0, 1, 2] to player 1, keeping [4, 2, 1, 4, 7]:\nValue to me:\n(4 * 55) + (2 * 52) + (1 * 89) + (4 * 79) + (7 * 39) = 220 + 104 + 89 + 316 + 273 = 1002\n\nThis is better than my outside offer. I'll use this as my counteroffer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI should not accept the current offer, as it gives me a value of 0, which is much worse than my outside offer of 765. I should not walk away, as I can get a better result with a counteroffer and future negotiations. Therefore, I should make a counteroffer to try to secure a better outcome for myself.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 1, 2]}\n",

Since it's round 2, the discount factor for this round is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [2, 0, 0, 1, 2]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 6 - 2 = 4\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Item 5: 9 - 2 = 7\n    My value for this offer is (4 * 55) + (2 * 67) + (1 * 5) + (4 * 76) + (7 * 57) = 220 + 134 + 5 + 304 + 399 = 1062.\n    The discounted value is 1062 * 0.9 = 955.8\n    \n*  **Potential counteroffers:** I need an offer that provides me a value greater than my outside offer after discounting. I'll start by calculating the value if I keep 1 unit of all items.\n    Keeping [1,1,1,1,1] would mean offering [5,1,0,4,8] and get: 55 + 67 + 5 + 76 + 57 = 260, which gives me 260 * 0.9 = 234 which is far lower than 1302.\n    \n   Since round 2 is the penultimate round, I should try for a good offer as if it were the last round. Let's try to give the other player only the items that are low value to me. So i'll offer [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]. This means I would keep [5, 2, 0, 5, 8].

I'll try keeping most items with a higher value. Let's try to offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 5]. Keeping [5, 1, 0, 4, 4]. The value is (5 * 55) + (1 * 67) + (0 * 5) + (4 * 76) + (4 * 57) = 275 + 67 + 0 + 304 + 228 = 874, giving a discounted value of 874*0.9 = 786.6\n    Let's try to offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 3], keeping [6, 2, 1, 4, 6] getting 330 + 134 + 5 + 304 + 342 = 1115.  Discounted is 1115 * 0.9 = 1003.5.\n    Let's try offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], keeping [6, 2, 1, 5, 8] = 330 + 134 + 5 + 380 + 456 = 1305. Discounted is 1305 * 0.9 = 1174.5.\n    Let's try to offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], keeping [6, 2, 1, 4, 9] = 330+134+5+304+513=1286. Discounted is 1286 * 0.9 = 1157.4\n   Let's try to keep a lot of the high value items. Let's try offering [1,1,0,2,2]. Keeping [5,1,1,3,7]. Value of 275 + 67+ 5 + 228+ 399= 974, 876.6.\n   Let's try an offer of [1, 0, 0, 0, 1], keeping [5, 2, 1, 5, 8].  Value of 275 + 134 + 5 + 380 + 456= 1250. Discounted of 1250 * 0.9 = 1125. \n   Let's try an offer of [0,0,0,1,2]. Keeping [6, 2, 1, 4, 7]. Value is 330 + 134 + 5 + 304 + 399 = 1172. Discounted value is 1054.8.\n    If I offer [1,0,0,1,0] I would keep [5,2,1,4,9] value = 275 + 134 + 5 + 304 + 513 = 1231. Discounted value is 1107.9\n   It seems hard to beat my outside offer with a better counteroffer. Let's try an offer that is close to my outside offer. Let's try keeping [6,2,1,5,6]. Offering [0,0,0,0,3]. This is a value of 330+134+5+380+342=1191, discounted is 1071.9\n    I think its best to try to get as many high value items as possible and offer the low value item 3.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 1 + 79 x 0 + 22 x 1 + 3 x 4 + 43 x 0\n    which is 59 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 62. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that offers in later rounds are worth slightly less (in present value terms).\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since I'm Player 1 and it's round 1, I need to make the first offer. I want to make an offer that is better than my outside offer and also leaves the potential for the other player to accept. My goal isn't to maximize my present value immediately, but to maximize the chance of acceptance in the end while ensuring the present value of the deal is at least as high as the outside option if accepted. I'm aiming to give them enough that they would not WALK, so it must be at least as good for them as their own outside option.\n\n   Here's how I'll proceed:\n    * I need to keep items whose values to me are high, and offer items that are not as valuable.\n    * I'll start by calculating my total value if I kept all the items. My total value is 6*25+1*79+2*22+4*3+4*43 = 150+79+44+12+172 = 457\n   * Now, let's consider offering some of the less valuable items first.

I offer [3,1,1,2,2]\n    My value = 3*25+0*79+1*22+2*3+2*43 = 75+0+22+6+86 = 189\n    This is good for me as it is > 62. \n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n* I have no current offer to evaluate. \n* I will not walk as I can achieve better than my outside offer with a little thought and effort.\n* I'll start by making an initial counteroffer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 62\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 25, Item 2: 79, Item 3: 22, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 43\n*   **Total item pool:** Item 1: 6, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.

This offer keeps [4,1,2,3,3].\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer's discounted value is 86.4, which is greater than my outside offer of 62.\n    *   My potential counteroffer [2, 0, 0, 1, 1] results in 361 in undiscounted value.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The discounted value of accepting the current offer (86.4) is greater than my outside offer (62). I could accept.\n*   However, I also can improve upon the current outcome with a counteroffer. Let's examine the values of the previous offers to help inform my choice of counteroffer. \n*   Previous Offer 1: [3, 1, 1, 2, 2]. This kept me [3, 0, 1, 2, 2]. This is worth (3 * 25) + (0 * 79) + (1 * 22) + (2 * 3) + (2 * 43) = 75 + 0 + 22 + 6 + 86 = 189. \n*   Previous Offer 2: [2, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This kept me [4, 1, 2, 3, 3]. This is worth (4 * 25) + (1 * 79) + (2 * 22) + (3 * 3) + (3 * 43) = 100 + 79 + 44 + 9 + 129 = 361\n*   Since I am aiming to maximize my final value, I will now aim for what appears to be my most valued items and try to offer items that I value less.\n\nI will propose the counteroffer [2, 0, 0, 1, 1] again. This keeps [4, 1, 2, 3, 3] which gives me a value of 361 which is much better than accepting the other offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Since this is round 3, the discount factor will be applied to the power of (3-1) = 2, so it will be 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer gives me [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, and 0 units of everything else. This has a value of 1 * 25 + 0 * 79 + 0 * 22 + 0 * 3 + 0 * 43 = 25.  My discounted value for this offer is 25 * 0.81 = 20.25\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to ensure my counteroffer is greater than my outside offer, when discounted for this round.  I could keep a large proportion of the items and offer the minimum acceptable. My outside offer is 62 and discounted for this round it would be 62 * 0.81 = 50.22.  I can make a counteroffer, but since this is the last round it doesn't matter, as any counteroffer from me on this turn will be treated as a walk if the other player makes another offer. It is therefore important to consider what counteroffer would be better for me than walking away, but there is no point offering more than I would be prepared to accept given that I need to keep the majority of the items for myself. A simple option is for me to offer the other player all of the items they previously offered me, which would be [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This leaves me with [5, 1, 2, 4, 4].\n    * The value of [5, 1, 2, 4, 4] is 5 * 25 + 1 * 79 + 2 * 22 + 4 * 3 + 4 * 43 = 125 + 79 + 44 + 12 + 172 = 432.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. Therefore, my value of this offer is:\n    (0 * 89) + (1 * 91) + (0 * 62) + (0 * 67) + (0 * 86) = 91.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 91 is less than my outside offer of 118. Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\nLet's evaluate some potential counteroffers to make sure we are making a good one. \n*   **Counteroffer 1**: Keeping everything, offer [0,0,0,0,0] to player 1. My value would be (2 * 89) + (5 * 91) + (0 * 62) + (3 * 67) + (3 * 86) = 178 + 455 + 0 + 201 + 258 = 1092.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 848. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1017 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

However, accepting the current offer is not optimal because it results in making an offer worse than my previous offer.\n*   Offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] yields me a value of 900.9, which is still far greater than my outside offer.\n\n**Final Action:**\n\nSince accepting the current offer would be a mistake, I should propose a counteroffer that gives Player 1 some items, but still leaves me with more than my outside option. I choose to counteroffer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 12 for item 1, 97 for item 2, 72 for item 3, 61 for item 4, 97 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 983. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 848. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 848. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1017 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 97 x 5 + 72 x 0 + 61 x 1 + 97 x 3\n    which is 837 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 848. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 848\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 12\n    *   Item 2: 97\n    *   Item 3: 72\n    *   Item 4: 61\n    *   Item 5: 97\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 0 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 3, the discount factor will be 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 2\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 0\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 3\n    \n    My value for this is: (2 * 12) + (4 * 97) + (0 * 72) + (3 * 61) + (3 * 97) = 24 + 388 + 0 + 183 + 291 = 886\n    This is without considering the discount factor, so the discounted value is 886 * 0.81 = 717.66\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what a better offer might look like. Since this is the last round, player 2's counteroffer if I don't accept will be treated as a walk. I should be making an offer that maximizes my value. It makes sense to give the other player the items I value the least.\n    Let's examine some counteroffers I could consider. For now, I'll calculate value without the discount factor, to compare it to my outside offer, before applying the discount.\n    * Keep [2, 5, 0, 3, 3]: My value is 2 * 12 + 5 * 97 + 0 * 72 + 3 * 61 + 3 * 97 = 24 + 485 + 0 + 183 + 291 = 983 - This is the best possible for me, but it doesn't involve offering anything to player 2. I should be making an offer that benefits both parties.\n    * Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]: My value is 983, discounted by 0.81 = 796.23\n    * Offer [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]: My value is (1*12 + 4*97 + 0*72 + 2*61 + 2*97) = 12 + 388 + 0 + 122 + 194= 716. Discounted value = 716 * 0.81 = 579.96\n    * Offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]: My value is (2 * 12) + (4 * 97) + (0 * 72) + (3 * 61) + (3 * 97) = 24+388+0+183+291= 886. Discounted value = 717.66\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer gives me a discounted value of 717.66, which is LESS than my outside offer of 848.\n    *    The best counteroffer value I can obtain is 983 and discounted is 796.23.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is bad for me as it values at less than my outside offer. I need to choose between walking away or providing a counteroffer. Since this is the last round and player 2's counteroffer will be treated as a walk, I should walk away if I have no better alternatives. My best counteroffer has a value of 796.23, which is also lower than my outside offer, therefore I must walk away.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",
