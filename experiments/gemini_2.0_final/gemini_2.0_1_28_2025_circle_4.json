                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step and determine my optimal action for round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 144\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 39\n    *   Item 2: 1\n    *   Item 3: 87\n    *   Item 4: 97\n    *   Item 5: 11\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 10 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 9 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means future rounds are worth 0.9 times the value of the current round. In round one, the discount factor has no impact (0.9^0 = 1).\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since this is the first round, I need to decide what to offer Player 2. I want to maximize my value but be strategic about it. Let's consider some options that do not fall into the list of errors. Mistake 3 is to offer 0 or all. So, I should offer something between 0 and total. It is the first turn so there is no information about the other player's value, so I can start with a reasonable offer that is fair. Offering a close to equal amount of items seems a good strategy, so an offer of half or less could be an option. Let's try offering half of the items:\n    *   Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 4 units of item 5\n    *   This would leave me with: 1 unit of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 unit of item 4 and 5 units of item 5.\n     *   My value would be: (1 * 39) + (5 * 1) + (3 * 87) + (2 * 97) + (5 * 11) = 39 + 5 + 261 + 194 + 55 = 554\n   *Let's try offering a little bit less, but taking most of the high value items. An example of this is:\n     * Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4 and 7 units of item 5\n     * This would leave me with: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\n     * My value would be: (1 * 39) + (2 * 1) + (4 * 87) + (3 * 97) + (2 * 11) = 39 + 2 + 348 + 291 + 22 = 702.\n      * This looks like a more reasonable starting offer.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is 144. Both example offers have a value over 144, so I would not be making a mistake if I proposed them, and they leave room to negotiate. I should start by making a counteroffer. The second offer seems to have a good value and leaves a good margin to negotiate.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nBased on this analysis, I should propose the second counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 8, 1, 0, 7]}\n```\n",

This means that an outcome in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times the value of the same outcome in round 1, and an outcome in round 3 will be worth 0.81 times the value of the same outcome in round 1. Since it is round 1, the discount is (0.9 ^ (1-1)) = 1, there is no discount.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate my total value for different divisions. I can start by considering a counteroffer where I keep a good portion of the valuable items and give away some of the less valuable items. Let me start with a relatively balanced split, offering half of the items, and giving away 1 unit of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5 to Player 2. My values for what I keep would be:\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 7 = 7\n    *   Item 2: 2 * 46 = 92\n    *   Item 3: 3 * 86 = 258\n    *   Item 4: 1 * 69 = 69\n    *   Item 5: 1 * 4 = 4\n    *   Total value: 7 + 92 + 258 + 69 + 4 = 430\n\n    I should also consider an offer where I keep a large portion of the items: offer 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5 to Player 2. My value for what I keep would then be:\n    *   Item 1: 2 * 7 = 14\n    *   Item 2: 3 * 46 = 138\n    *   Item 3: 4 * 86 = 344\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 69 = 138\n    *   Item 5: 1 * 4 = 4\n    *   Total value: 14 + 138 + 344 + 138 + 4 = 638\n\n    Let's also consider a more extreme offer where I keep most of the items of high value: offer 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5 to Player 2. My value for what I keep is:\n    *   Item 1: 2 * 7 = 14\n    *   Item 2: 2 * 46 = 92\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 86 = 172\n    *   Item 4: 1 * 69 = 69\n    *   Item 5: 1 * 4 = 4\n    *   Total value: 14 + 92 + 172 + 69 + 4 = 351\n\n    I will use the second offer (0, 0, 2, 0, 0).

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 358. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 636 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 4, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 4, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 358\n*   **My item values:** \n    *   Item 1: 7\n    *   Item 2: 46\n    *   Item 3: 86\n    *   Item 4: 69\n    *   Item 5: 4\n*   **Total items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2\n    *   Item 2: 3\n    *   Item 3: 6\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 1\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer (Player 2's offer to me):** [2, 3, 4, 2, 1]\n    *   Value of offer = (2 * 7) + (3 * 46) + (4 * 86) + (2 * 69) + (1 * 4) = 14 + 138 + 344 + 138 + 4 = 638\n    *   Discounted value = 638 * 0.9 = 574.2\n\n*   **Previous Offer (Player 1's offer to Player 2):** [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]. This means I kept [2, 3, 4, 2, 1]\n    * Value of that offer to me was (2 * 7) + (3 * 46) + (4 * 86) + (2 * 69) + (1 * 4) = 14 + 138 + 344 + 138 + 4 = 638.\n    * Discounted value of that offer for me at round 1 is 638 * 0.9^0 = 638.\n\n*   **Consider a few potential counteroffers (and value to myself if the other player accepts it):** Note that in a round 2 we can not offer something equal to zero, nor something equal to all items. This can be inferred from error 3.\n    *   Counteroffer 1: Give Player 2 [1,1,3,1,0]. That is, I keep [1,2,3,1,1]. Value to me = (1*7) + (2*46) + (3*86) + (1*69) + (1*4) = 7 + 92 + 258 + 69 + 4 = 430. Discounted value to me: 430 * 0.9 = 387\n    *   Counteroffer 2: Give Player 2 [0,1,1,0,0]. That is, I keep [2,2,5,2,1]. Value to me = (2*7) + (2*46) + (5*86) + (2*69) + (1*4) = 14 + 92 + 430 + 138 + 4 = 678. Discounted value to me: 678 * 0.9 = 610.2\n    *   Counteroffer 3: Give Player 2 [1,2,3,0,0]. That is I keep [1,1,3,2,1]. Value to me = (1*7) + (1*46) + (3*86) + (2*69) + (1*4) = 7 + 46 + 258 + 138 + 4 = 453. Discounted value to me: 453 * 0.9 = 407.7\n\n*   **Comparison to my outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer is worth 574.2 to me (after discounting), which is better than my outside offer of 358.\n    *   Counteroffer 1 is worth 387 which is greater than my outside offer.\n    *   Counteroffer 2 is worth 610.2 which is greater than my outside offer.\n    *   Counteroffer 3 is worth 407.7 which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 574.2 which is much greater than my outside offer of 358.\n*   Any counteroffer may cause me to lose this deal, and given this is round 2, the risk is higher since there is only one more round to play.\n*   Given that the current offer is higher than my outside offer, I should accept.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

I should aim to get as much value as possible while still leaving the other player with enough to not reject the deal outright. It is suboptimal to offer no or all items. I want to ensure I don't offer something less valuable than my outside offer (Mistake 2), which is 624.\n\nI calculate the total value of all items to me:\n(5 * 23) + (2 * 57) + (3 * 61) + (1 * 59) + (2 * 88) = 115 + 114 + 183 + 59 + 176 = 647.

This gives me a value of 563.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept a current offer because there is no current offer.\n*   I should not walk away, since this would lead to my outside offer of 624, and a counteroffer of [1,0,1,0,0] will not guarantee a better deal but is an initial step in negotiation and I may get a better deal.\n*   I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since this is round 1, the discount factor will be 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1. So, there is no discount on the values in the current round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 31) + (0 * 22) + (1 * 20) + (0 * 62) + (0 * 51) = 31 + 0 + 20 + 0 + 0 = 51.\n    *   Since this is round 1, the discounted value is 51 * 1 = 51.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that will give me more value than my outside offer of 6. I want to keep as much as possible of items that have a high value for me, like item 4 and item 5.\n    * Let's analyze some potential counteroffers.\n        *   **Offer [0,0,0,0,0]:** Keeping all items would give me a value of (5 * 31) + (2 * 22) + (3 * 20) + (1 * 62) + (2 * 51) = 155 + 44 + 60 + 62 + 102 = 423. Obviously, this would be the best possible outcome, but not very likely to be accepted by Player 1.\n        *   **Offer [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]:** This would give Player 1 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2 and 1 unit of item 3 and leave me 4 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2 and 2 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 2 unit of item 5 which is worth  (4 * 31) + (1 * 22) + (2 * 20) + (1 * 62) + (2 * 51) = 124 + 22 + 40 + 62 + 102 = 350.\n        *   **Offer [2, 0, 1, 0, 1]:** This would give player 1 2 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 3 and 1 unit of item 5 and leave me with 3 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5 which is worth (3 * 31) + (2 * 22) + (2 * 20) + (1 * 62) + (1 * 51) = 93 + 44 + 40 + 62 + 51 = 290.\n        *   **Offer [3, 1, 2, 1, 1]:** This would give player 1 3 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5 and leave me with 2 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5 which is worth (2*31) + (1 * 22) + (1* 20) + (0*62) + (1*51) = 62 + 22 + 20 + 0 + 51 = 155.\n    \n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 51 which is much better than my outside offer of 6.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is much better than my outside offer (51 > 6).\n*   Since it is the first round I should propose a counteroffer, and not accept or walk.\n*   I should try to get as many of the higher value items as possible.\n\nI will try a counteroffer of [2, 0, 1, 0, 1]. This should leave me with a large fraction of the value and not be too greedy.

Since we are in round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me \\[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer: (1 * 31) + (0 * 22) + (0 * 20) + (0 * 62) + (0 * 51) = 31.\n    *   Adjusted value by discount factor 0.9: 31 * 0.9 = 27.9\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   I need to consider offers that are better than my outside offer of 6. I will need to keep in mind that round 3 is the last round and my counteroffer is considered a walk away if the game is still going to round 3. Let's compute the value of keeping all items as a baseline:\n        *   My value for keeping all items: (5 * 31) + (2 * 22) + (3 * 20) + (1 * 62) + (2 * 51) = 155 + 44 + 60 + 62 + 102 = 423.\n    *   Let's examine what the previous round offer I made yielded:\n        * I offered \\[2, 0, 1, 0, 1] to Player 1, keeping \\[3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n        * My value for keeping \\[3, 2, 2, 1, 1] is (3 * 31) + (2 * 22) + (2 * 20) + (1 * 62) + (1 * 51) = 93 + 44 + 40 + 62 + 51 = 290.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 624. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 864 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1.0. This means there is no discount on the current round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so I have no value to assess.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate the total value for me of keeping certain numbers of items. Because I have not made a prior offer, I need to ensure that I make a rational offer that is not worse than my outside offer.\n     *  A simple even split would be to give 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 to Player 2. This would leave me with 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. The total value would be (4 * 1) + (4 * 31) + (2 * 77) + (1 * 46) + (2 * 23) = 4 + 124 + 154 + 46 + 46 = 374.\n     *   Another approach would be to offer the minimum amount on the first turn, with the hope of the other player making a reasonable counter offer, and negotiating from that position. This would be to offer Player 2 1 unit of each item and keep the remainder. This gives my value:\n      Item 1: 7 * 1 = 7\n      Item 2: 7 * 31 = 217\n      Item 3: 3 * 77 = 231\n      Item 4: 1 * 46 = 46\n      Item 5: 3 * 23 = 69\n      Total: 7 + 217 + 231 + 46 + 69 = 570\n       This value of 570 is greater than my outside offer of 142, and the discount factor of 1.0 (at round 1) makes this acceptable.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Since there is no current offer, I cannot accept it.\n*   The value of making a counteroffer is 570, which is greater than my outside offer of 142, therefore, I will make a counteroffer giving away one of each item to the other player.\n*   Walking away now would give me a value of 142, which is less than 570 from the potential counteroffer, so I shouldn't walk away.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 2. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 462 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is 2.\n*   **Item Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 10\n    *   Item 2: 78\n    *   Item 3: 40\n    *   Item 4: 6\n    *   Item 5: 20\n*   **Total Item Pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 8 units\n    *   Item 2: 8 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting a deal in a later round is worth less than the same deal in an earlier round. If a deal is made in round r, the value is multiplied by gamma^(r-1). In round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1, so no discounting.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   7 units of item 1 (8-1) = 7 * 10 = 70\n    *   7 units of item 2 (8-1) = 7 * 78 = 546\n    *   3 units of item 3 (4-1) = 3 * 40 = 120\n    *   1 unit of item 4 (2-1) = 1 * 6 = 6\n    *   3 unit of item 5 (4-1) = 3 * 20 = 60\n    *   Total Value of Current Offer = 70 + 546 + 120 + 6 + 60 = 802\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer (802) is significantly better than my outside offer (2).\n* **Potential Counteroffers:** It is not necessary to fully evaluate all possible counteroffers at this moment, since the current offer is already very good. It will likely be more beneficial to attempt to improve the current offer, but not so much as to risk walking away. I will not make an offer worse for me than the current one, nor will I make an offer worse than my outside offer. I will offer my opponent an offer better than their first, as otherwise, there is no incentive for them to accept. I will offer them 2 units of item 2, and 1 unit of the remaining items.\n\n    * **Counteroffer**: [2,2,2,2,2]\n    * **My Value of Counteroffer:**\n        * Item 1: 6 * 10 = 60\n        * Item 2: 6 * 78 = 468\n        * Item 3: 2 * 40 = 80\n        * Item 4: 0 * 6 = 0\n        * Item 5: 2 * 20 = 40\n        * Total: 648\n    This is still higher than the outside offer and does not commit mistake 2.\n    This also offers my opponent a higher value of items in total, increasing their incentive to accept.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n* The current offer of 802 is very good.\n* However, it is only round 1.\n* I will propose a counteroffer that is better for my opponent than their current offer but still provides me with a high value.\n* Therefore, I should not ACCEPT the current offer, nor WALK away.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

If I propose to keep 6, 6, 2, 1, 2 and offer the remaining amounts to Player 1, my value is: (6 * 10) + (6 * 78) + (2 * 40) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 20) = 60 + 468 + 80 + 6 + 40 = 654. That is a reduction from the value I would get by taking the current deal.\n    * If I keep 8, 8, 4, 2, 4, my value would be: (8 * 10) + (8 * 78) + (4 * 40) + (2 * 6) + (4 * 20) = 80 + 624 + 160 + 12 + 80 = 956.\n    * Let's try a slightly more balanced offer that still favors me, like giving 2, 2, 1, 0, 1. This means I would keep 6, 6, 3, 2, 3. My value is: (6 * 10) + (6 * 78) + (3 * 40) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 20) = 60 + 468 + 120 + 12 + 60 = 720. Discounted 720 * 0.9 = 648.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer gives me a discounted value of 727.2.\n*   Walking away gives me a value of 2.\n*    A potential counteroffer, like 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, would give me a discounted value of 648 and is potentially risky, it's a reduction over the current offer, but it could be a step toward the ideal outcome.\n\nGiven the current offer is much better than my outside offer and the counteroffer would be worse for me and the counteroffer is in the same region and possibly lower than the current offer given the discount factor, I should accept.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This means that a deal in later rounds is worth less, but also gives me more time to negotiate a better deal.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    Since this is the first round, I will make an offer. I need to make an offer that is better for me than my outside offer of 221. I also need to make a counteroffer that isn't obviously a bad deal for player 2.\n    I will consider an offer where I take a majority of items, but offer some. Since item values vary widely, I will also favor items with higher value for me.\n\n    *   **Option A:** Offer Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n        * My value:\n        *   Item 1: 5 units * 39 = 195\n        *   Item 2: 3 units * 3 = 9\n        *   Item 3: 1 units * 42 = 42\n        *   Item 4: 5 units * 75 = 375\n        *   Item 5: 1 units * 77 = 77\n        *   Total value = 698\n    *    **Option B:** Offer Player 2: 3 units of item 1, 2 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n        * My value:\n        *   Item 1: 4 units * 39 = 156\n        *   Item 2: 2 units * 3 = 6\n        *   Item 3: 1 units * 42 = 42\n        *   Item 4: 4 units * 75 = 300\n        *   Item 5: 1 units * 77 = 77\n        *   Total value = 581\n\n    Since option A offers me a higher total value, I will choose that one. This value (698) is also significantly higher than my outside offer value (221).\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer since there isn't one\n*   I should not walk away, since I think I can get a better value than my outside offer.\n*   I will make an initial counteroffer. I will offer 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 221.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 39 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 3 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 42 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 75 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 77 per unit\n*   **Total items:** 7 units of item 1, 4 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 7 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. Since this is round 2, if I make a deal now, the value will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1)=0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [2, 1, 0, 2, 0]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 7 - 2 = 5 units * 39 = 195\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units * 3 = 9\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2 units * 42 = 84\n    *   Item 4: 7 - 2 = 5 units * 75 = 375\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 units * 77 = 154\n    *   Total value of current offer for me: 195 + 9 + 84 + 375 + 154 = 817\n    *  Discounted value of accepting current offer: 817*0.9 = 735.3\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I can offer to Player 2 and how that affects my value. I want to maximize my discounted value which should be greater than my outside offer.\n    * I have to consider whether I can achieve a better value than my current offer.\n    * In the previous round I offered the other player [2,1,1,2,1], which means I kept [5, 3, 1, 5, 1].\n    * The value of that offer to me is:\n      * Item 1: 5 * 39 = 195\n      * Item 2: 3 * 3 = 9\n      * Item 3: 1 * 42 = 42\n      * Item 4: 5 * 75 = 375\n      * Item 5: 1 * 77 = 77\n      * Total value of my previous counteroffer: 195 + 9 + 42 + 375 + 77 = 698\n    *   The value of my previous offer was 698, while the value of the current offer for me is 817. Accepting the current offer, discounted, would give me 735.3, which is greater than my outside offer of 221.\n    * It doesn't make sense to make an offer worse than the one I just received.\n    * Making an offer better for myself is unlikely given that the other player has more bargaining power in the last round.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n* The current offer is worth 735.3 to me after applying the discount factor. This is much higher than my outside offer of 221.  If I were to walk away, I would receive 221.\n* Making a counteroffer in round 2 that improves my position is unlikely since in the last round, Player 2 has more bargaining power.\n* I should accept the current offer, as it results in the highest payoff I can expect in this situation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 314.\n*   **Item values:** My values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 15\n    *   Item 2: 94\n    *   Item 3: 74\n    *   Item 4: 74\n    *   Item 5: 12\n*   **Total items:** 3 units of item 1, 10 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** Gamma is 0.9. Since it's round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means any outcome this round is worth 90% of its undiscounted value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive 1 unit of item 1 and 0 of the others. My value for this is (1 * 15) = 15. After discount, this is 15*0.9 = 13.5. This is much worse than my outside offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   Let's consider offering an even split of items, since this usually makes more sense than giving nothing or all of the items away:\n        *   Item 1: Give 1, keep 2. Value 2*15 = 30\n        *   Item 2: Give 5, keep 5. Value 5*94 = 470\n        *   Item 3: Give 1, keep 2. Value 2*74 = 148\n        *   Item 4: Give 0, keep 0. Value 0*74 = 0\n        *   Item 5: Give 2, keep 2. Value 2*12 = 24\n        *   Total value = 30 + 470 + 148 + 0 + 24 = 672.  Discounted, 672 * 0.9 = 604.8\n    *   Lets consider keeping all items:\n        * Item 1: Give 0, keep 3. Value 3*15 = 45\n        * Item 2: Give 0, keep 10. Value 10*94 = 940\n        * Item 3: Give 0, keep 3. Value 3*74 = 222\n        * Item 4: Give 0, keep 0. Value 0*74 = 0\n        * Item 5: Give 0, keep 4. Value 4*12 = 48\n        * Total value = 45 + 940 + 222 + 0 + 48 = 1255.  Discounted, 1255 * 0.9 = 1129.5\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is 13.5 and is terrible compared to my outside option of 314. An even split offer seems reasonable at 604.8 and even better is to keep all items giving me 1129.5 which is much better. I will make a counteroffer. I will keep all the items. This is a valid offer and won't be treated as a WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning they keep everything. This means I get:\n    *   0 * 30 + 0 * 84 + 0 * 87 + 0 * 86 + 0 * 95 = 0\n    *   Discounted value: 0 * 0.9 = 0. This is much worse than my outside offer of 737\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I will need to consider a counteroffer. Let's consider offering Player 1 a fraction of the items. I should aim to keep items with higher personal value. Let me evaluate offering 2 units of item 2 and 1 unit of item 5 and keeping the rest. If I give that, then I get 3 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. The value is:\n    *    3*30 + 8*84 + 3*87 + 0*86 + 3*95 = 90 + 672 + 261 + 0 + 285 = 1308\n    *  1308 * 0.9 = 1177.2\n    Since the discount factor has already been accounted for in the value calculation, my total value would be 1177.2\n    \nLet's also calculate the total value of keeping everything for myself.\n*  3*30 + 10*84 + 3*87 + 0*86 + 4*95 = 90 + 840 + 261 + 0 + 380 = 1571\n   * Discounted Value: 1571 * 0.9 = 1413.9\n    \n* Let's calculate the value of offering [0, 4, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1:\n* I get: 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. \n   *  3*30 + 6*84 + 3*87 + 0*86 + 4*95 = 90 + 504 + 261 + 0 + 380 = 1235\n   * 1235 * 0.9 = 1111.5\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0,0,0,0,0] has a value of 0 after discount, which is much worse than my outside offer value of 737.\n*   Offering [2, 1, 0, 0, 1] to the opponent is suboptimal because it has lower payoff of 1177.2 than keeping everything myself and having 1413.9\n*   I could offer [0,4,0,0,0] to the opponent (like the first offer from player 1) and still achieve a higher discounted value of 1111.5\n*  Therefore, I should propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer and is more favorable than offering [2,1,0,0,1] or [0,4,0,0,0].\n\n Given my item values, I should try to keep as many of the high valued items as I can while still offering something to Player 1. Let's offer [0, 2, 0, 0, 1]. This gives me 3 of item 1, 8 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 3 of item 5.\n    *  3*30 + 8*84 + 3*87 + 0*86 + 3*95 = 90 + 672 + 261 + 0 + 285 = 1308\n    * 1308 * 0.9 = 1177.2. This is still more favorable than my outside offer of 737.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, and does not give away all of my valuable items.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

This is the guaranteed value I get if negotiations fail, so I need to ensure any deal is worth more to me.\n*   **Item Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 79 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 97 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 72 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 25 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 65 per unit\n*   **Total Items:**\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times as much as the same deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times as much as the same deal in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so I cannot accept anything yet.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to propose an initial counteroffer that is beneficial to me. I want to maximize my value. Since I go first, I want to try to get most of the items. I will start by offering the minimum amount to the opponent that is greater than zero of each item type. This may seem like a greedy offer, but this is the first offer and I do not have any prior information about how my opponent values the items. By offering very little, I can see how they react to this offer, and decide if I should make changes to my strategy. If the other agent walks away I still get my outside offer. If they don't walk away, then the next offer will be discounted by the factor 0.9, so getting a good offer now is important.\n    * I will offer 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This leaves me with 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 unit of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. This division has a total value of (0 * 79) + (4 * 97) + (1 * 72) + (2 * 25) + (4 * 65) = 0 + 388 + 72 + 50 + 260 = 770.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 551.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 79\n    *   Item 2: 97\n    *   Item 3: 72\n    *   Item 4: 25\n    *   Item 5: 65\n*   **Total items:** 1 unit of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 79 = 0\n    *   5 units of item 2: 5 * 97 = 485\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 72 = 144\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 25 = 75\n    *   5 units of item 5: 5 * 65 = 325\n    Total value = 0 + 485 + 144 + 75 + 325 = 1029.\n    The discounted value is 1029 * 0.9 = 926.1.\n* **Round 1 Offer**: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 2. Thus, Player 1 would keep [0,4,1,2,4]. The value of this offer to Player 1 is 0*79 + 4*97 + 1*72 + 2*25 + 4*65 = 0 + 388 + 72 + 50 + 260= 770. The discounted value of this offer is 770*0.9^0=770. \n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's think about the items that are most valuable to me. Item 2 is the most valuable, followed by item 5, 3, 1 and 4. I currently have all of them (except for one unit of item 1 which they are currently offering to me). If I make an offer, I want to keep most of the value. I must give something though. Let's consider some options:\n    *   Offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]:\n        *   I get 1 item 1, 4 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 5 of item 5.\n        *   Value = 79 + 388 + 144 + 75 + 325 = 1011.\n        *   Discounted value = 1011 * 0.9 = 909.9.\n    *  Offering [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]:\n        *   I get 1 item 1, 4 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 4 of item 5.\n        *   Value = 79 + 388 + 72 + 50 + 260 = 849\n        *   Discounted value = 849 * 0.9 = 764.1\n\n    * Offering [1,2,1,2,2]:\n        * I get 0 item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 3 of item 5\n        * value = 0 + 291 + 72+ 25 + 195 = 583\n        * Discounted value = 583 * 0.9 = 524.7\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 926.1 to me, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 551.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer has a value of 926.1, significantly greater than my outside offer (551).\n*   The offer that I made in round 1 had a discounted value of 770. \n*   I don't need to make an offer worse than my previous offer so offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] is not a good idea.\n*  I should not make an offer worse than my outside offer. [1,2,1,2,2] is not a good idea. \n*  I should not offer nothing or all items at this point.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is optimal for me to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best course of action for Player 1 in round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 239. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 63\n    *   Item 2: 32\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 18\n    *   Item 5: 87\n*   **Total item pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 7 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal made in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times its face value and in round 3, will be worth 0.81 times the face value. Since it's round 1, the discount is not immediately relevant, but will become important in future rounds if we do not reach a deal in this round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to formulate a sensible counteroffer that does not violate the rules. It is best to avoid any offers that are obviously unfair to myself or to the other player and also to avoid giving away my entire stock of items, or offering none. A reasonable starting point would be to offer a somewhat even split of the items, while trying to favour the items I value less.\n\n    Let's consider offering Player 2 the following:\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 0\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 3\n\n    This leaves me with:\n     *   Item 1: 4\n    *   Item 2: 3\n    *   Item 3: 1\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 3\n\n    My value for this split is:\n    *   4 * 63 = 252\n    *   3 * 32 = 96\n    *   1 * 5 = 5\n    *   3 * 18 = 54\n    *   3 * 87 = 261\n    *  Total Value = 252 + 96 + 5 + 54 + 261 = 668\n\n    This value of 668 is substantially higher than my outside option of 239.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I will need to make a counteroffer. I will propose the split calculated above, which gives the other player a reasonable portion of the items, and keeps a lot of value for myself without risking an immediate WALK decision from the other agent. This approach gives me a good starting point from which to negotiate. I should not walk at this point.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 0, 2, 3]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Since we are in round 2, if we accept an offer in this round, our payoff is discounted by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 offers me [2, 1, 0, 1, 2]. This means:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 63 = 126\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 32 = 32\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 5 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 18 = 18\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 87 = 174\n    *   Total value of current offer: 126 + 32 + 0 + 18 + 174 = 350\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 350 * 0.9 = 315\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to calculate the value of several counteroffers and compare it to my outside offer. Let's try some scenarios:\n\n    *   **Scenario A: Counteroffer the original offer from round 1**: \n    Player 1 offered [3, 2, 0, 2, 3] to Player 2 in round 1, which means I would keep 7-3=4 of item 1, 5-2=3 of item 2, 1-0=1 of item 3, 5-2=3 of item 4, and 6-3=3 of item 5. This would give me a value of:\n        *   4 units of item 1: 4 * 63 = 252\n        *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 32 = 96\n        *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 5 = 5\n        *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 18 = 54\n        *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 87 = 261\n        *   Total value: 252 + 96 + 5 + 54 + 261 = 668\n        *   Discounted value: 668 * 0.9 = 601.2\n    * **Scenario B: Offer something closer to an even split**\n    Let's try offering [3, 2, 0, 2, 3]. This means I keep [4, 3, 1, 3, 3] and it has a discounted value of 601.2 (calculated above)\n\n    *   **Scenario C: Offer slightly worse than original offer, but better than current**\n     Offer [4, 2, 0, 2, 2]. This means I keep [3, 3, 1, 3, 4]. This would give me:\n        *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 63 = 189\n        *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 32 = 96\n        *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 5 = 5\n        *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 18 = 54\n        *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 87 = 348\n        *   Total value: 189 + 96 + 5 + 54 + 348 = 692\n         * Discounted value 692 * 0.9 = 622.8\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer has a discounted value of 315, which is greater than my outside offer of 239. Therefore, I should not walk away or reject this offer out of hand.\n*   Offer B, from Scenario B is worse for me (601.2)\n*   Offer C, from Scenario C is better for me (622.8) than either accepting the current offer (315), or my outside offer (239).\n*   Accepting current offer is better than outside offer, but there is scope to gain a better value.\n\nBased on this analysis, I should make a counteroffer. Specifically, I will offer [4, 2, 0, 2, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 0, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 0, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

I'll offer them:\n    * Item 1: 3 units\n    * Item 2: 1 unit\n    * Item 3: 2 units\n    * Item 4: 3 units\n    * Item 5: 2 units\n    This results in me getting the same offer that they proposed, which is clearly not beneficial for me.\n    \n    Let's propose offering a little more to Player 1 to see if they'll accept. Here is another counter offer, offering player 1:\n    * Item 1: 2 unit\n    * Item 2: 1 unit\n    * Item 3: 1 unit\n    * Item 4: 2 units\n    * Item 5: 1 unit\n    This leaves me with:\n    * Item 1: 4 unit * 4 = 16\n    * Item 2: 2 unit * 51 = 102\n    * Item 3: 3 unit * 54 = 162\n    * Item 4: 4 unit * 10 = 40\n    * Item 5: 3 unit * 89 = 267\n    My total value would be: 16 + 102 + 162 + 40 + 267 = 587. This is still worse than my outside offer, but I'll propose it anyway, since it might lead to a deal.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n    I should reject the current offer and propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 365\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 15, Item 2: 63, Item 3: 48, Item 4: 27, Item 5: 52\n*   **Total items:** 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n*  **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, any outcome will be multiplied by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I'm being offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    My total value from current offer is (4 * 15) + (2 * 63) + (3 * 48) + (4 * 27) + (3 * 52) = 60 + 126 + 144 + 108 + 156 = 594\n    The discounted value of this offer is 594 * 0.9 = 534.6.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to think about how much to give away to potentially get a better deal than my outside offer (and hopefully better than 534.6).\n    \n    Let's calculate the value of the previous round's Player 1 offer from my perspective. Player 1 offered [3, 1, 2, 3, 2], meaning I would keep [3, 2, 2, 3, 2], which would be:\n    (3 * 15) + (2 * 63) + (2 * 48) + (3 * 27) + (2 * 52) = 45 + 126 + 96 + 81 + 104 = 452\n    The discounted value would be 452 * 0.9 = 406.8, which is much better than walking away. The current offer is better than this one, so making an offer like this would violate the rule of making a worse offer for myself than a prior offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer's discounted value (534.6) is significantly better than my outside offer (365). Therefore, I should not walk away.\n\n*   My value from the current offer (534.6) is better than my outside offer value (365) and my previous offer (406.8). I should accept the offer if it is the case that I expect no offers better for me than this.\n\nSince we're in round 2, I anticipate that there might be another offer. However, the value of the offer on the table is greater than my outside offer, so accepting is the rational move, given the discount.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

I am making the first offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what counteroffer would be both beneficial to me and acceptable (or at least not immediately rejected) by the other player. Since I don't know the other player's values, I will make a reasonable offer that gives a good value to me. I will calculate some potential counteroffers.\n    *   **Example 1: Offering 1 unit of each item to Player 2:** This means I keep 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n        *   My value: (3 * 49) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 66) + (4 * 82) + (4 * 23) = 147 + 12 + 198 + 328 + 92 = 777.

This is greater than my outside offer value.\n    *   **Example 3: Offering 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 unit of item 5.** This means I keep 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5\n        *   My value: (2 * 49) + (2 * 6) + (2 * 66) + (2 * 82) + (2 * 23) = 98 + 12 + 132 + 164 + 46 = 452. This is worse than my outside offer.\n    \n    I'll choose Example 2 as a good compromise in the first round, which gives a value that is well above my outside offer.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *  Example 1 (offer = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]): Value = 777. This is greater than 494.\n    *  Example 2 (offer = [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]): Value = 623. This is greater than 494.\n    *  Example 3 (offer = [2, 1, 2, 3, 3]): Value = 452.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 1272\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 34\n    *   Item 2: 44\n    *   Item 3: 34\n    *   Item 4: 84\n    *   Item 5: 94\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less than current offers, so I should prefer to settle sooner rather than later if the offers are acceptable.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]. This means they are keeping [2, 2, 3, 3, 3]. \n    *   My value for what I receive from the current offer is:\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 34 = 68\n        *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 44 = 44\n        *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 34 = 34\n        *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 84 = 168\n        *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 94 = 188\n        *   Total value: 68 + 44 + 34 + 168 + 188 = 502\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer of 502 is significantly less than my outside offer of 1272. Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's calculate the value of a few potential counteroffers.  I want to keep most of the high-value items (4 and 5) and offer more of the lower-value items (1, 2, and 3) to player 1. I should also consider the total number of items.\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] - I would keep [3, 2, 3, 4, 4]\n        *   My value: 3*34 + 2*44 + 3*34 + 4*84 + 4*94 = 102 + 88 + 102 + 336 + 376 = 1004\n    *   **Counteroffer 2:** [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] - I would keep [3, 3, 3, 5, 5]\n        *   My value: 3*34 + 3*44 + 3*34 + 5*84 + 5*94 = 102 + 132 + 102 + 420 + 470 = 1226\n    *   **Counteroffer 3:** [1, 1, 1, 0, 0] - I would keep [3, 2, 3, 5, 5]\n        *   My value: 3*34 + 2*44 + 3*34 + 5*84 + 5*94 = 102 + 88 + 102 + 420 + 470 = 1182\n    *   **Counteroffer 4:** [0, 0, 0, 1, 1] - I would keep [4, 3, 4, 4, 4]\n         *  My value: 4*34 + 3*44 + 4*34 + 4*84 + 4*94 = 136 + 132 + 136 + 336 + 376 = 1116\n    *  **Counteroffer 5:** [2, 1, 2, 1, 1] - I would keep [2, 2, 2, 4, 4]\n         *   My value = 2*34 + 2*44 + 2*34 + 4*84 + 4*94 = 68 + 88 + 68 + 336 + 376 = 936\n\n    Counteroffers 2, 3, and 4 are all better than counteroffer 1 or 5. Counteroffer 2 is closest to my outside offer. It is also a valid counter offer. All of these offers are valid and give me a better outcome than the current offer. I will choose counter offer 2.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is 502 which is much worse than my outside offer of 1272.\n*   A valid counteroffer is [1, 0, 1, 0, 0], which would give me a value of 1226, which is not much less than my outside offer. This would be an improvement on the current offer on the table for me.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 494\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 49, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 66, Item 4: 82, Item 5: 23\n*   **Total items:** 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, if we accept an offer our value will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9. If no agreement is made, then we get our outside offer value with the discount factor. So if we walk away now, our value will be 494 * 0.9 = 444.6\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I would get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 49 = 49\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 6 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 66 = 66\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 82 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 23 = 0\n    *   Total value: 49 + 0 + 66 + 0 + 0 = 115\n    *   Discounted value: 115 * 0.9 = 103.5\n\n    This is significantly less than my outside offer value (494), which, if we are currently in round 2, gives a discounted value of 444.6 if we walk now. So we don't want to accept.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would get by making counteroffers. I need to ensure what I keep is worth more than my discounted outside offer value. Let's consider offering something reasonable but also favorable to myself, say I give 1 unit of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. So the offer to player 2 would be [1,0,1,0,0] and I keep 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5. This would be worth:\n    *  3 units of item 1: 3 * 49 = 147\n    *  3 units of item 2: 3 * 6 = 18\n    *  3 units of item 3: 3 * 66 = 198\n    *  5 units of item 4: 5 * 82 = 410\n    *  5 units of item 5: 5 * 23 = 115\n    *  Total value: 147+18+198+410+115=888\n    * This value is much greater than the discounted outside option so this is a reasonable offer to make\n\nLet's also consider if I was to offer more to player 2. If I offer 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 2 of item 5, then I would keep 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 3 of item 5. This would have value to me of:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 49 = 98\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 6 = 12\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 66 = 198\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 82 = 246\n    *  3 units of item 5: 3* 23 = 69\n    *   Total value: 98 + 12 + 198 + 246 + 69 = 623\n    *   This value is still much greater than my outside offer value, but this is a less good deal than the offer I considered previously.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer (103.5 after discounting) is much worse than my outside option, so I should not accept it.\n*   I should not walk away since I can make a better offer. \n*   I should propose a counteroffer. The offer I have selected is to offer [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] to Player 2.\n\n**Final Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 34 = 34\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 44 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 34 = 34\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 84 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 94 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 34 + 0 + 34 + 0 + 0 = 68\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 68 * 0.9 = 61.2\n*   **Value of my outside offer at this round:** 1272 * 0.9 = 1144.8\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   To calculate a good counteroffer, first calculate the remaining items:\n      * Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 for me\n      * Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3 for me\n      * Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3 for me\n      * Item 4: 5 - 0 = 5 for me\n      * Item 5: 5 - 0 = 5 for me\n      * My maximum value if I take all of these: 3 * 34 + 3 * 44 + 3 * 34 + 5 * 84 + 5 * 94 = 102 + 132 + 102 + 420 + 470 = 1226\n       * Discounted value of all items for me : 1226 * 0.9 = 1103.4\n    *   Since the current offer is terrible, my goal should be to get an offer worth at least my outside offer.

Giving [0,0,0,0,0] gives a total value of 1103.4, which is lower than my outside offer (1144.8). I should try to counter-offer again for the maximum amount possible without going below my outside offer. It seems that no offer makes it above my outside offer of 1144.8.  I should walk since no other counteroffer will be better than my outside offer, and the current offer is significantly lower.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is significantly below my outside offer, and I cannot find a better counteroffer, I will choose to WALK away and take my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and make a decision for round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 425\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 12\n    *   Item 2: 75\n    *   Item 3: 97\n    *   Item 4: 99\n    *   Item 5: 29\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 7 units\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*  **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) will reduce the value of any agreement in subsequent rounds. Since this is the first round, there is no discount (gamma^(1-1) = 1) so for this round discount isn't a factor.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider a reasonable initial offer. I want to maximize my value but also be realistic about getting a deal. Since there are 3 rounds, a very aggressive offer is likely to get rejected. I should be careful not to make any offers that would fall below my outside offer, because then walking away will be a better alternative. It would also be a mistake to offer everything or nothing. A good place to start is by looking at an equal split of the items. Since there is an uneven number of items, this is difficult. Let's start by offering Player 2 half of each item and round up to be a realistic starting point (while being favorable to myself). So I will offer Player 2:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 4 unit\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n    \n    This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit (1 * 12 = 12)\n    *   Item 2: 3 units (3 * 75 = 225)\n    *   Item 3: 0 units (0 * 97 = 0)\n    *   Item 4: 0 unit (0 * 99 = 0)\n    *   Item 5: 3 units (3 * 29 = 87)\n    \n    My total value for this offer to Player 2 is: 12 + 225 + 0 + 0 + 87 = 324\n\n    Let's try another offer where I am slightly more aggressive, but still far above my outside offer, since it is round 1. This will also allow player 2 a reasonable opportunity to make a counteroffer, giving me time to gauge their response. Let's try offering Player 2:\n        *   Item 1: 0 units\n        *   Item 2: 3 units\n        *   Item 3: 0 units\n        *   Item 4: 0 unit\n        *   Item 5: 2 units\n    This means I keep:\n        *   Item 1: 2 units (2 * 12 = 24)\n        *   Item 2: 4 units (4 * 75 = 300)\n        *   Item 3: 1 unit (1 * 97 = 97)\n        *   Item 4: 1 unit (1 * 99 = 99)\n        *   Item 5: 4 units (4 * 29 = 116)\n\n    My total value for this offer to Player 2 is: 24 + 300 + 97 + 99 + 116 = 636, which is much better than my outside option.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe offer above is much better than my outside offer. The previous offer was still above my outside offer, but much less than 636. I'm going to start off this negotiation by offering:\n    *   Item 1: 0 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 0 units\n    *   Item 4: 0 unit\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]}\n```\n",

This means accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting it in earlier rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me \\[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], which means I would receive these units:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit\n    The value of this offer to me is (1 * 30) + (1 * 71) + (1 * 11) + (1 * 38) + (1 * 73) = 223. This is less than my outside offer of 798.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would gain from making a counteroffer. Since it's round 1, rejecting the offer will not incur the discount factor. So I should try to make an offer that's better than 798.\n\n    I will consider keeping 3 of every item for myself, except for item 3 where I will only keep 6 and offer 1 to player 1:\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 30 = 90\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 71 = 213\n    * I will receive: 6 units of item 3 = 6 * 11 = 66\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 38 = 114\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 73 = 219\n    Total value of keeping items: 702\n     \n     I will consider keeping 3 of every item for myself, except for item 3 where I will only keep 5 and offer 2 to player 1:\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 30 = 90\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 71 = 213\n    * I will receive: 5 units of item 3 = 5 * 11 = 55\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 38 = 114\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 73 = 219\n    Total value of keeping items: 691\n     \n     I will consider keeping 3 of every item for myself, except for item 3 where I will only keep 4 and offer 3 to player 1:\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 30 = 90\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 71 = 213\n    * I will receive: 4 units of item 3 = 4 * 11 = 44\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 38 = 114\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 73 = 219\n    Total value of keeping items: 680\n\n     I will consider keeping 3 of every item for myself, and offering the remaining items to Player 1:\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 30 = 90\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 71 = 213\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 11 = 33\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 38 = 114\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 73 = 219\n    Total value of keeping items: 669\n\n    I can propose a counter offer that is better than my outside offer. A counter offer of giving [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] to Player 1 seems reasonable. I'll calculate the value for myself.\n     * I will receive: 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 30 = 90\n    * I will receive: 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 71 = 213\n    * I will receive: 6 units of item 3 = 6 * 11 = 66\n    * I will receive: 5 units of item 4 = 5 * 38 = 190\n    * I will receive: 4 units of item 5 = 4 * 73 = 292\n    Total value of this offer to me is 851, which is greater than my outside offer, 798.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer. I should not accept it. I also should not walk away. I will make a counteroffer to Player 1 to receive [3, 3, 6, 5, 4].\n\nMy counteroffer to player 1 is [1, 0, 1, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

I will calculate keeping 3 units of each of item 2 and item 5, and the rest for the other player, using the same calculation method used in the prompt:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit * 30 = 30\n    *   Item 2: 3 units * 71 = 213\n    *   Item 3: 6 units * 11 = 66\n    *   Item 4: 5 units * 38 = 190\n    *   Item 5: 3 units * 73 = 219\n    Total value: 30 + 213 + 66 + 190 + 219 = 718. This is a poor offer, since it is less than my outside offer of 798, making mistake #2.\n    Let's consider a counter offer where I offer Player 1 the following: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]. This gives me:\n    * Item 1: 4 * 30 = 120\n    * Item 2: 3 * 71 = 213\n    * Item 3: 5 * 11 = 55\n    * Item 4: 4 * 38 = 152\n    * Item 5: 4 * 73 = 292\n    Total: 120+213+55+152+292=832.\n    Discounted: 832 * 0.9 = 748.8, which is lower than my outside offer.\n  Let's consider another offer where I offer Player 1 the following: [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]. This gives me:\n    * Item 1: 3 * 30 = 90\n    * Item 2: 2 * 71 = 142\n    * Item 3: 5 * 11 = 55\n    * Item 4: 4 * 38 = 152\n    * Item 5: 3 * 73 = 219\n    Total: 90 + 142 + 55 + 152 + 219 = 658. This is also a poor offer.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Current offer (discounted): 792.9 which is less than my outside offer of 798. This offer would be a mistake to accept (mistake #4).\n    *   The counteroffers I just calculated are all worse than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer. So, I will not accept it.\n*  I calculated several counteroffers which would be a mistake (making an offer worse than my outside offer). I am in the second round, so I can make another counteroffer. Given the limited number of rounds, and the fact that I've only made one previous offer, I think a counteroffer is better than walking away right now.\n*  I will make a counteroffer that gives me my outside offer value, based on the items I value most. To find it, I will give all of Item 3 and Item 4 to Player 1. I will also give them 0 of Item 1 and Item 5. I will find out how many Item 2 I need to give them in order to match my outside offer value. Let x be the units I will offer of item 2.\n    * (4 * 30) + (3 - x) * 71 + 0 + 0 + (4 * 73) = 798/0.9 = 886.66\n    * 120 + 213 - 71x + 292 = 886.66\n    * 625 - 71x = 886.66\n    * -71x = 261.66\n    * x = -3.68. This doesn't work, since we can only give positive values of items.\n    Let's try offering 0 of Items 1 and 2, and 2 units of item 3, and 2 units of item 4. Let's solve for the remaining item (item 5). Let y be the number of units of item 5 to offer to Player 1.\n    * (4 * 30) + (3 * 71) + (5 * 11) + (4 * 38) + (4-y) * 73 = 798/0.9 = 886.66\n    * 120 + 213 + 55 + 152 + 292 - 73y = 886.66\n    * 832 - 73y = 886.66\n    * -73y = 54.66.  Again, this is a bad solution, as y would have to be a negative number.\n    Let's try giving 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 1 of item 5 to Player 1.\n      (3 * 30) + (2 * 71) + (5 * 11) + (4 * 38) + (3*73) = 90 + 142 + 55 + 152 + 219 = 658.\n    This is a bad offer again.\n\n    It's going to be very difficult to achieve the exact right value, and due to the lack of time, I will make a counteroffer that gives more to Player 1 than my previous offer. I will also give some of each item to avoid mistake 3. I will offer [2,1,2,2,2].\n      \n    \n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

This means accepting an offer in a later round will result in a discounted value of (0.9^(r-1)) * value.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 562. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 562\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 22, Item 2: 46, Item 3: 97, Item 4: 20, Item 5: 40\n*   **Total pool of items:** 7 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 7 - 1 = 6 units,  value = 6 * 22 = 132\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units, value = 3 * 46 = 138\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 1 = 4 units, value = 4 * 97 = 388\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units, value = 3 * 20 = 60\n    *   Item 5: 7 - 1 = 6 units, value = 6 * 40 = 240\n    *   Total value of current offer = 132 + 138 + 388 + 60 + 240 = 958\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (958) is much higher than my outside offer (562).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's explore some options for a counteroffer. It's important to not make an offer worse than my outside offer, and also not give away too much.\n    * Giving away [2, 1, 2, 1, 2] would mean keeping [5, 3, 3, 3, 5] with total value: 5*22 + 3*46 + 3*97 + 3*20 + 5*40 = 110 + 138 + 291 + 60 + 200 = 799\n    * Giving away [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] would mean keeping [6, 4, 4, 4, 6] with total value: 6*22 + 4*46 + 4*97 + 4*20 + 6*40 = 132 + 184 + 388 + 80 + 240 = 1024\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] has a value of 958 for me which is significantly better than my outside offer of 562. \n*   Making a counteroffer could lead to a better deal in the long run, since 958 seems like a quite modest offer for what is available in the pool, but since it's round 1, that also risks Player 1 walking away. Since I am not constrained to accepting immediately, a counteroffer seems reasonable. Let me propose an initial counteroffer that gives away more valuable items but still keeps a reasonable value.\n*   I propose giving away [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]. This would have a value of 1024 for me which is better than my value from accepting.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me at least as much value as my outside offer. Let's calculate the value of keeping most of the items for myself. I will initially consider offering [1, 0, 1, 0, 1].\n        This means I would have:\n        * Item 1: 6 units * 22 = 132\n        * Item 2: 4 units * 46 = 184\n        * Item 3: 4 units * 97 = 388\n        * Item 4: 4 units * 20 = 80\n        * Item 5: 6 units * 40 = 240\n        Total value = 132 + 184 + 388 + 80 + 240 = 1024\n        Discounted value = 1024 * 0.9 = 921.6\n       This is far better than the outside option.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer (345.6 < 562).\n*   Walking away would result in a guaranteed 562.\n*   Making a counteroffer of [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] is better than the outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 321. This is my guaranteed fallback if we don't reach an agreement.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 9 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 83 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 31 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 39 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 79 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that deals made in later rounds are worth less in present value than deals made earlier. This incentivizes reaching a deal sooner rather than later.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   My total value for all items is (3 * 9) + (3 * 83) + (4 * 31) + (1 * 39) + (4 * 79) = 27 + 249 + 124 + 39 + 316 = 755.\n    *   Since I want to maximize my value, I should try to keep the higher value items. I need to make an offer that is high enough for player 2 to consider it but that doesn't give away all the value in the items I value highly.\n    *   Let's consider an offer where I keep 2 of each item except for item 4, where i keep the only unit. This would be giving away 1 item 1, 1 item 2, 2 item 3 and 3 item 5 to the opponent. This would mean that I keep 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This would be worth (2 * 9) + (2 * 83) + (2 * 31) + (1 * 39) + (1 * 79) = 18 + 166 + 62 + 39 + 79 = 364\n    *   Let's consider an offer where I keep all the item 5 and 4s and give them 1 item 1, 1 item 2 and 2 item 3. This would be giving away 1 item 1, 1 item 2 and 2 items 3 to the opponent. This would mean that I keep 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 4 unit of item 5. This would be worth (2 * 9) + (2 * 83) + (2 * 31) + (1 * 39) + (4 * 79) = 18 + 166 + 62 + 39 + 316 = 601.\n    *   I will choose the second of these since it is greater than the other and greater than my outside offer. \n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Since there is no current offer, I will propose a counteroffer that gives player 2 1 item 1, 1 item 2 and 2 items 3. \n*   This offer gives me value 601, and this is also greater than my outside offer of 321\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Since we're in round 2, if a deal is made, our value will be multiplied by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would keep:\n    *   item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   item 2: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   item 3: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   item 4: 8 - 1 = 7 units\n    *   item 5: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    My value for keeping this is:\n    (3 * 1) + (2 * 46) + (3 * 90) + (7 * 11) + (3 * 68) = 3 + 92 + 270 + 77 + 204 = 646\n    Since this would be discounted by 0.9, the present value would be: 646 * 0.9 = 581.4.\n    This is less than my outside offer of 699.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to make sure my counteroffer is beneficial to me (greater than 699 when multiplied by 0.9 at this round). Let's analyze a few potential counteroffers that are in my favor and greater than the value of my outside offer, for example keeping the majority of each item.:\n   *   Counteroffer 1: Player 2 gets [1, 0, 1, 1, 0], meaning I get [3, 2, 3, 7, 4]. My value is (3 * 1) + (2 * 46) + (3 * 90) + (7 * 11) + (4 * 68) = 3 + 92 + 270 + 77 + 272 = 714. Discounted value: 714 * 0.9 = 642.6. This is less than my outside offer, so it's no good.\n   *  Counteroffer 2: Player 2 gets [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], meaning I get [4, 2, 4, 7, 4]. My value is (4 * 1) + (2 * 46) + (4 * 90) + (7 * 11) + (4 * 68) = 4 + 92 + 360 + 77 + 272 = 805. Discounted value: 805 * 0.9 = 724.5. This is more than my outside offer, and a fair offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n    The current offer is worse than my outside offer (581.4 < 699), so accepting is a mistake. Walking away would give me 699. A counteroffer like [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] would benefit me more than my outside offer and would be acceptable.\n\nTherefore, my best action is to make the counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 304\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 2, Item 2: 84, Item 3: 19, Item 4: 14, Item 5: 24\n*   **Total items:** 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 8 of item 4, 4 of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since it's round 2, any deal we make now will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I receive 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. My value for this is:\n    (0 * 2) + (0 * 84) + (0 * 19) + (1 * 14) + (0 * 24) = 14\n    The discounted value for this in round 2 is 14 * 0.9 = 12.6.\n    This is significantly worse than my outside offer of 304.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate the value of keeping items for myself to determine what to offer. I should not make an offer worse than my outside offer (Mistake 2), or make an offer that is worse than my previous offer (Mistake 1).\n    My previous offer was [1,0,1,1,1], meaning I would get 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 7 of item 4, 3 of item 5, giving me value: \n    (3 * 2) + (2 * 84) + (3 * 19) + (7 * 14) + (3 * 24) = 6 + 168 + 57 + 98 + 72 = 401\n    A discounted value of 401 * .9 = 360.9, which was greater than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer that is at least equal to or better than my outside offer after discounting.\n    I need to keep at least a value of 304 / 0.9 = 337.78 to be as good as my outside offer in the last round. \n    Let me calculate the total value of all my items again: (4 * 2) + (2 * 84) + (4 * 19) + (8 * 14) + (4 * 24) = 8 + 168 + 76 + 112 + 96 = 460. \n\n    Let's try a counteroffer where I keep most of the high value items. For example, If I offer player 1 [1,0,1,1,1], this is my previous offer and will result in a payoff to me of 360.9.\n\n    Let's try a new offer where I offer Player 1 a little bit more of the lower value items and less of the high-value item. If I offer Player 1 [2, 1, 2, 3, 2]  I would keep [2, 1, 2, 5, 2] which will have a value to me of:\n    (2*2) + (1*84) + (2*19) + (5*14) + (2*24) = 4 + 84 + 38 + 70 + 48 = 244\n    This offer is worse than my outside offer after discounting of 304 (.9 * 244 = 219.6), so this will not work.\n\n    I could offer Player 1 more of the low value items and still get better than my outside offer. If I offer Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 2, 1], that means I keep [3, 2, 3, 6, 3], giving me: \n    (3*2) + (2*84) + (3*19) + (6*14) + (3*24) = 6+ 168 + 57 + 84 + 72 = 387.\n    387 * 0.9 = 348.3. This is greater than my outside offer.\n  \n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer. I should reject it. I should not accept it as it would be a Mistake 4. A better option is to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. I should not Walk away (mistake 5) because a better counteroffer is available to me.\n\nI will make the counteroffer [1, 0, 1, 2, 1] as it is better than my previous offer and has more value to me than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

This is my guaranteed fallback if we fail to reach an agreement.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 78 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 42 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 80 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 77 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 98 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   5 units of Item 1\n    *   2 units of Item 2\n    *   2 units of Item 3\n    *   3 units of Item 4\n    *   7 units of Item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of a deal in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** As this is round 1, I'm making the initial offer, so I don't yet have an offer to assess. I want to make a good counteroffer. I want to offer something that is likely to be accepted. If my offer is too greedy, I will be counteroffered and the discount rate will kick in, so I will end up receiving less. I must also consider what my worst offer is. I must make sure that my value under the offer is greater than my outside offer of 1484. Lets try several different possible counteroffers to determine which would be best.\n\n     *   If I offered 2 units of each item:\n          *   Player 1:\n                *   Item 1: 3 * 78 = 234\n                *   Item 2: 0 * 42 = 0\n                *   Item 3: 0 * 80 = 0\n                *   Item 4: 1 * 77 = 77\n                *   Item 5: 5 * 98 = 490\n            *    Total value: 234 + 0 + 0 + 77 + 490 = 801\n             * This is bad, as it is less than my outside offer and so would constitute Mistake 2.\n     *   If I offered 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5, so I keep:\n        *  Player 1:\n           * Item 1: 4 * 78 = 312\n           * Item 2: 1 * 42 = 42\n           * Item 3: 1 * 80 = 80\n           * Item 4: 2 * 77 = 154\n           * Item 5: 6 * 98 = 588\n           * Total value: 312 + 42 + 80 + 154 + 588 = 1176. This is not good as it is less than my outside offer.\n     *  If I offered 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5, so I keep everything.\n          * Total value: (5 * 78) + (2 * 42) + (2 * 80) + (3 * 77) + (7 * 98) = 390 + 84 + 160 + 231 + 686 = 1551. I could keep everything.\n          * This is risky, as Player 2 will very likely counteroffer.\n     * I need to come up with something that is reasonable to player 2, and better than my outside offer. A good heuristic is to try to give away approximately half of the total value. Since my total value is 1551, half of this is 775.5. I will aim to give this away, more or less. It would be ideal to make it as palatable as possible for player 2, which will mean giving away the lowest value items.\n         * Lets try offering 2 units of Item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 4 units of item 5. This gives value to player 2 of  (2 * 78) + (1 * 42) + (1 * 80) + (1 * 77) + (4 * 98) = 156 + 42 + 80 + 77 + 392 = 747. \n         * So I keep:\n             * Item 1: 3 * 78 = 234\n             * Item 2: 1 * 42 = 42\n             * Item 3: 1 * 80 = 80\n             * Item 4: 2 * 77 = 154\n             * Item 5: 3 * 98 = 294\n            * Total value: 234+42+80+154+294 = 804. This is not better than my outside offer. Let's try it again, but less greedy.\n         * Lets try offering 1 unit of Item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n             * Item 1: 4 * 78 = 312\n             * Item 2: 1 * 42 = 42\n             * Item 3: 1 * 80 = 80\n             * Item 4: 2 * 77 = 154\n             * Item 5: 4 * 98 = 392\n             * Total value 312 + 42 + 80 + 154 + 392 = 980.\n          * This is bad as it is less than my outside offer.\n         * Let's try 1 unit of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 2 of item 5. This gives player 2:\n             * (1 * 78) + (1 * 42) + (0 * 80) + (1 * 77) + (2 * 98) = 78 + 42 + 0 + 77 + 196 = 393.\n              * So I get:\n             * Item 1: 4 * 78 = 312\n             * Item 2: 1 * 42 = 42\n             * Item 3: 2 * 80 = 160\n             * Item 4: 2 * 77 = 154\n             * Item 5: 5 * 98 = 490\n             * Total: 312 + 42 + 160 + 154 + 490 = 1158.\n          * This is bad.\n         * Let's try 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 2 of item 5. This gives player 2\n            * 0 * 78 + 1 * 42 + 1 * 80 + 1 * 77 + 2 * 98 = 42 + 80 + 77 + 196 = 395.\n           * So I get\n            * 5 * 78 = 390\n            * 1 * 42 = 42\n            * 1 * 80 = 80\n            * 2 * 77 = 154\n            * 5 * 98 = 490\n            * Total = 390 + 42 + 80 + 154 + 490 = 1156.

This gives player 2 a value of 1 * 78 + 1 * 42 + 0 * 80 + 0 * 77 + 2 * 98 = 78 + 42 + 0 + 0 + 196 = 316.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1053. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1173 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

However, by making a counteroffer I could get an outcome with a value that is potentially higher.\n*   If I reject this offer I risk having a worse outcome due to the discount factor in future rounds, as I am not certain of a better outcome with a counteroffer from Player 1, even if I make an optimal counteroffer.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will make a counteroffer that aims for a more favorable distribution, but not so aggressively that it would risk the negotiation. I will offer Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] to try and see if they will move closer to my desired offer. This value for me is still significantly higher than the current offer and my outside offer, while leaving room for negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 627\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 43\n    *   Item 2: 74\n    *   Item 3: 29\n    *   Item 4: 98\n    *   Item 5: 22\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n*   **Discount factor (gamma):** 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value if accepted in round 1, and in round 3 it would be worth 0.9^2 times its value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I would get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 43 = 43\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 74 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 29 = 29\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 98 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 22 = 0\n    *   Total value: 43 + 0 + 29 + 0 + 0 = 72\n    *   Since it's round 2, this offer's value is discounted: 72 * 0.9 = 64.8\n    This is a terrible offer for me, as my outside option is 627.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer that would be good for me. I will need to calculate the value of keeping different quantities of items and ensure that my total value is at least as good as my outside offer.  I will aim for a counteroffer that is also attractive enough to the other player such that they would consider accepting it (instead of rejecting or walking away).\n\n    I will calculate how many units of each item to offer to Player 2. I'll start by keeping most of the high-value items for myself (items 4 and 2) and try to balance the offer. To start, consider keeping 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 1 of item 5:\n     * My items: \n         * Item 1: 3 * 43 = 129\n         * Item 2: 2 * 74 = 148\n         * Item 3: 4 * 29 = 116\n         * Item 4: 2 * 98 = 196\n         * Item 5: 1 * 22 = 22\n     * Total value to me: 129 + 148 + 116 + 196 + 22 = 611\n     This is still less than my outside option, so I will try to increase my share of valuable items. I will consider offering Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This means I keep: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n    *   My items:\n        *   Item 1: 4 * 43 = 172\n        *   Item 2: 2 * 74 = 148\n        *   Item 3: 4 * 29 = 116\n        *   Item 4: 3 * 98 = 294\n        *   Item 5: 2 * 22 = 44\n    *   Total value to me: 172 + 148 + 116 + 294 + 44 = 774. This is better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is far worse than my outside offer, and worse than my initial offer. Therefore, I should not accept it.\nA counteroffer of [1, 1, 2, 0, 0] would give me value of 774, which is higher than my outside option of 627. This is also somewhat balanced, so it is potentially acceptable to the other player.\n\nTherefore, I will make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Since it's round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]. This means they are giving me 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5.

This offer will be less than my outside option when discounted.\n        *   **Offer 2:** [1,0,1,0,0] would yield a value of 993 as discussed above. This is already discounted by 0.9 (as this is round 2), to be a value of 893.7. This is more than my outside option.\n        *   **Offer 3:** An even split (rounded up) of [3, 2, 3, 2, 1] would result in values of 2(97) + 1(72) + 3(30) + 1(88) + 1(36) = 194 + 72 + 90 + 88 + 36 = 480 which is way too low.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer has a discounted value of 889.2, which is greater than my outside offer of 886. \n*   Making a counteroffer has the potential to give me more value than 889.2, so I will make a counteroffer instead of accepting.\n*   I should not offer worse than my previous offer [1,0,1,0,0] which had a value of 993 or 893.7 when discounted, so this will be my basis.\n*   As the previous offers have been a bit below my preferred offers, I will make a counteroffer that is in my favor, without going too far.\n*   I will try to gain back one unit of item 2.\n\n**Action:**\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best action for Player 1 in round 3.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 627.\n*   **Item Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 43 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 74 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 29 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 98 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 22 per unit\n*   **Total Pool of Items:** 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since it is round 3 the discount factor has to be calculated to the power of 3-1 = 2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81. This means any deal I make this round will be multiplied by 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer Value:** The current offer to me is [1, 0, 1, 1, 0], meaning I get 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. The remaining items go to Player 2.\n\n    *   My value for the current offer:\n        *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 43 = 43\n        *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 74 = 0\n        *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 29 = 29\n        *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 98 = 98\n        *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 22 = 0\n        *   Total value of the current offer before discounting: 43 + 0 + 29 + 98 + 0 = 170\n    *  Total value after discounting: 170 * 0.81 = 137.7\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since this is the final round, if I make a counteroffer, it will effectively be a WALK for me, as any counteroffer by player 2 will be treated as a WALK. This makes the decision simple: compare the discounted value of the current offer (137.7) to my outside offer (627) and determine whether to accept or walk away.\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer's discounted value (137.7) is significantly *less* than my outside offer of 627.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\nSince the discounted value of the current offer is much less than my outside offer, it is not beneficial to accept it. I will choose to walk away and take my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

Since we can't have half items, I'll use this concept as a guide to decide on a counter offer. I need to keep more than 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 0 unit of item 5, to get me over 344.\n    *   Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep a larger share of the higher-value items (items 1 and 5).

Accepting it would be a Mistake 4.\n*   Walking away now is a possibility because it guarantees me 344.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 743. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 825 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 9 - 3 = 6\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1\n    My value for the current offer: (6 * 18) + (2 * 63) + (3 * 58) + (3 * 70) + (1 * 66) = 108 + 126 + 174 + 210 + 66 = 684\n    My discounted value = 684 * 0.9 = 615.6\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** We will evaluate some options in the next step to see if we can do better, but we know from the prior round that [2, 1, 1, 1, 0] is worth less, since it was rejected.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer has a discounted value of 615.6, which is less than my outside offer value of 743. Accepting now would be a mistake since it yields less value than my outside offer. Therefore I should not ACCEPT.\n\nI should not WALK either, as there is still an opportunity to receive a better offer in the next round.\n\nI will propose a counteroffer that aims to achieve a value better than my outside offer. I should ask for more of each item. Let's propose offering the other player [2, 1, 1, 1, 0], which was my previous offer, and evaluate a possible better offer in the third round. My value would be:\n*   Item 1: 9 - 2 = 7\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1\n    My value for this: (7 * 18) + (3 * 63) + (4 * 58) + (4 * 70) + (1 * 66) = 126 + 189 + 232 + 280 + 66 = 893\n    My discounted value at round 2: 893 * 0.9 = 803.7.

So accepting the offer is a valid option.\n\n* However, since the discount factor for this round is 0.9, and since I have already made a prior counteroffer, we will try to push Player 1 slightly with a new offer.

This is greater than my outside offer and seems like a good starting position.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer, as there is no current offer.\n*   I should not walk away, as I can propose a reasonable counteroffer that benefits me.\n*   I should propose the counteroffer calculated above, as it gives me a value of 491 > 373, my outside offer, and should give me a better chance of negotiating a good outcome.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 373\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 67, Item 2: 74, Item 3: 8, Item 4: 88, Item 5: 2\n*   **Total pool of items:** 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** Gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]. This means I get to keep 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. Let's calculate its value:\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 67 = 67\n    *   Item 2: 2 * 74 = 148\n    *   Item 3: 1 * 8 = 8\n    *   Item 4: 3 * 88 = 264\n    *   Item 5: 3 * 2 = 6\n    *   Total value of current offer: 67 + 148 + 8 + 264 + 6 = 493\n    *   Discounted value of the current offer: 493 * 0.9 = 443.7\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer that gives player 2 less, for example, [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This would mean I keep 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. \n    *   Item 1: 1 * 67 = 67\n    *   Item 2: 3 * 74 = 222\n    *   Item 3: 1 * 8 = 8\n    *   Item 4: 4 * 88 = 352\n    *   Item 5: 3 * 2 = 6\n    *   Total Value of proposed offer: 67 + 222 + 8 + 352 + 6 = 655\n    *  Discounted value of this proposed counteroffer is 655 * 0.9 = 589.5\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (443.7) is greater than my outside offer value (373). The discounted value of the example counter offer(589.5) is also better than my outside offer (373)\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of [0, 1, 0, 2, 0] has a discounted value of 443.7, which is greater than my outside offer of 373. Therefore, accepting this offer is better than walking away. However, my proposed counteroffer [0,0,0,1,0] provides an even better outcome. Therefore, I should make the counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 469. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 469\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 63, Item 2: 31, Item 3: 43, Item 4: 20, Item 5: 87\n*   **Total pool of items:** 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor for this round is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 1, 0].  This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. The value to me is (0 * 63) + (0 * 31) + (0 * 43) + (1 * 20) + (0 * 87) = 20.  Since this is round 2, this is discounted to 20 * 0.9^1 = 18. This is much lower than my outside offer of 469.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate how much various counter offers would be worth and if they would be better than my outside offer. The current offer is very low so I will start by calculating what the value of an offer of giving 1 unit of each item to Player 1 would be worth to me:\n    * I would receive:\n        * Item 1: 1 - 1 = 0\n        * Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2\n        * Item 3: 1 - 1 = 0\n        * Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4\n        * Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n    * My value would be: (0 * 63) + (2 * 31) + (0 * 43) + (4 * 20) + (2 * 87) = 0 + 62 + 0 + 80 + 174 = 316\n    * This is less than my outside offer so I need to look at other offers. Let's try offering player 1 the same offer as in round 1, so [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n    * I would receive:\n        * Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1\n        * Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2\n        * Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1\n        * Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n        * Item 5: 3 - 0 = 3\n    * My value would be (1 * 63) + (2 * 31) + (1 * 43) + (3 * 20) + (3 * 87) = 63 + 62 + 43 + 60 + 261 = 489.\n    * This offer is more valuable to me than my outside offer. Discounted this is 489 * 0.9 = 440.1, but still more valuable to me than taking my outside offer in the last round. I will make this counteroffer.\n\n*   **Comparison to my outside offer:** My outside offer is 469. The current offer of 18 (discounted) is way worse. The counteroffer of 489 discounted to 440.1 would still make it less valuable than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible.\n*   Walking away would give me 469.\n*   A counteroffer of [0, 1, 0, 2, 0] has a value to me of 489, which multiplied by the discount rate is 440.1, making it slightly worse than my outside offer in the final round.\n*   Since I am in round 2 I need to choose between making a counteroffer, accepting a bad offer, or walking away. My counteroffer in the last round would be less valuable than my outside offer so it would be better to walk away. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 87 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 74 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 94 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 78 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 46 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   4 units of Item 1\n    *   2 units of Item 2\n    *   2 units of Item 3\n    *   2 units of Item 4\n    *   6 units of Item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means that offers accepted in later rounds are worth less. Specifically, an offer accepted in round 2 is only worth 0.9 * value to me, and one accepted in round 3 will be worth 0.9^2 * value to me.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what kind of counteroffer would be beneficial. I want to maximize my value but avoid making any of the five mistakes. Giving my opponent too much is bad, as it will lower my value to below my outside offer, but giving them too little may mean that they walk, or make a counteroffer worse for me. I will attempt a balanced offer that leaves me with more than my outside offer. I will calculate a potential counteroffer:\n    * Keeping 2 units of item 1,  1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n      *   Value of item 1: 2 * 87 = 174\n      *   Value of item 2: 1 * 74 = 74\n      *   Value of item 3: 1 * 94 = 94\n      *   Value of item 4: 1 * 78 = 78\n      *   Value of item 5: 3 * 46 = 138\n      *   Total value: 174 + 74 + 94 + 78 + 138 = 558.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 272. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 588 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step and determine the best action for Player 2 in round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 272\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 1\n    *   Item 2: 48\n    *   Item 3: 79\n    *   Item 4: 44\n    *   Item 5: 24\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 2\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor (gamma):** 0.9\n    *   The discount factor means that the value of any outcome in round 2 will be multiplied by 0.9, and the value of any outcome in round 3 will be multiplied by 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means Player 2 receives:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 - 0 = 6 units\n    *   Total value for Player 2: (3 * 1) + (1 * 48) + (2 * 79) + (2 * 44) + (6 * 24) = 3 + 48 + 158 + 88 + 144 = 441\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** We'll consider a potential counteroffer to see if we can get a better deal. Let's start by considering offering an even split of all items to Player 1: [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]. This is a valid offer. The value of this for Player 2 is: \n     * Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n     * Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n     * Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n     * Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n     * Item 5: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n      *  Total value for Player 2: (2 * 1) + (1 * 48) + (1 * 79) + (1 * 44) + (3 * 24) = 2 + 48 + 79 + 44 + 72 = 245. This is worse than our outside offer of 272 and also worse than the current offer on the table. Let's try to ask for more.\n      Let's try giving Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This would be the same as the current offer except we'd be keeping one more of item 2, which is valuable.\n       * Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n       * Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n       * Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n       * Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n       * Item 5: 6 - 0 = 6 units\n       *  Total value for Player 2: (3 * 1) + (2 * 48) + (2 * 79) + (2 * 44) + (6 * 24) = 3 + 96 + 158 + 88 + 144 = 489. This is a good amount above the outside offer, and is the most we can get without offering nothing to the other player.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Accepting current offer: 441 > 272 (outside offer)\n    *   Counteroffer [1,0,0,0,0] = 489. This is greater than the current offer.\n    *  It is clear it would be beneficial to attempt to get more.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] is worth 441 to us, which is already greater than our outside offer of 272. However, we can propose the counteroffer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] to get a value of 489 which is better. \nSince it is round 1, we should not walk away. Therefore, we should propose a counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 936\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 87, Item 2: 74, Item 3: 94, Item 4: 78, Item 5: 46\n*   **Total pool of items:** 4 units of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 6 units of Item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 2, if we reach a deal this round, our value is multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means they are keeping 1 unit of item 1, and I will receive 1 unit of item 1. My value for this offer is:\n\n    *   1 unit of Item 1: 1 * 87 = 87\n    *   Total value: 87\n    *   Discounted value: 87 * 0.9 = 78.3\n    *   This is much lower than my outside offer of 936, so it is not acceptable, and would be Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    * The first round offer from Player 1 gave Player 2 [1,1,0,0,0], valued at 87+74 = 161 for Player 2.\n    * The first round offer from Player 2 gave Player 1 [1,0,0,0,0], valued at 87 for Player 1.\n   \n    Let's consider a counteroffer that attempts to divide items more fairly.\n    I currently have all of the units for item types 2,3,4, and 5 and 3 units of item 1, valued at 3*87 + 2*74 + 2*94 + 2*78 + 6*46 = 261 + 148 + 188 + 156 + 276 = 1029. A better offer would be to give more away than my outside offer, as this would mean I am guaranteed to do better than my walkaway amount. \n    I can keep 3 units of Item 1 (value 261), 1 unit of Item 2 (value 74), 1 unit of Item 3 (value 94), 1 unit of Item 4 (value 78), and 3 units of Item 5 (value 138), for a total of 645. I offer the remaining items to Player 2: 1 of Item 1, 1 of Item 2, 1 of Item 3, 1 of Item 4, and 3 of Item 5. This offer would be [1,1,1,1,3]. This gives me a value of 645 this round.\n    The value of this offer for me is 645 * 0.9 = 580.5 This is less than my walk away amount, and therefore Mistake 2.\n\n    I need to make an offer that is better than my walk away amount. If I offer half of all items, that will be less than half of the total value, so that is no good.\n    Let's aim for an offer that is at least 936/0.9 = 1040 in the end. This requires 1040 = x*87 +y*74 + z*94+a*78+b*46. I currently have 261 + 148+188+156+276 = 1029. I need to keep 1040/0.9 =1155 value to beat my walkaway amount. That isn't going to work. Let's try offering nothing and keeping all the items. Then I have 1029 * 0.9 = 926.1, which is less than my walkaway. My previous calculation was wrong, I only need to beat my walkaway in total, not each individual round. \n    I will make a counteroffer giving away [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], i.e. offering nothing and keeping everything, for a total value of 1029, and after discounting 926.1, which is less than my walk away amount of 936, which is Mistake 2.\n    To improve this, I will make an offer that keeps just more than my walk away amount, so that if I end up being forced to accept a worse counteroffer in the following round, I can still walk away.\n    I'll try keeping 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5, with a total value of 87. I'll give the other player [3,2,2,2,6], with a total value for me of (3*87 + 2*74 + 2*94 + 2*78 + 6*46) = 261 + 148 + 188 + 156 + 276 = 1029, less the 87 I keep which is 942. This isn't high enough. \n    Let's aim for 936/0.9 = 1040 value, and keep 1040, this means giving away items worth 1029 - 1040 = -11 units. Impossible. \n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [1,0,0,0,0] is worth 78.3 to me, which is significantly lower than my outside offer value of 936.\n*   My previous attempts at making counteroffers have resulted in making offers worse than my walk away amount.\n*   I need to make an offer that is at least as good as my outside offer after the discount.\n*   I will make a counteroffer that gives away nothing and keeps all items.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 272\n*   **My item values:** \n    *   Item 1: 1\n    *   Item 2: 48\n    *   Item 3: 79\n    *   Item 4: 44\n    *   Item 5: 24\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, any deal we make now will be multiplied by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 0 units of all items. My total value from this offer would be 0. Since 0 is less than my outside offer of 272, and my outside offer will not be discounted, accepting this is not beneficial.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    Let's consider a few potential counteroffers to see their values:\n        *   **Counteroffer 1: Keep all items:** Offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This would mean I keep all the items:\n            * 4 * 1 (item 1) + 2 * 48 (item 2) + 2 * 79 (item 3) + 2 * 44 (item 4) + 6 * 24 (item 5) = 4 + 96 + 158 + 88 + 144 = 490.\n            * Discounted value: 490 * 0.9 = 441. This is better than my outside offer, so we need to avoid giving away too many items.\n        *   **Counteroffer 2: Offer Player 1 half of the items:** Offer Player 1 [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]. This would mean I keep:\n            * 2 * 1 (item 1) + 1 * 48 (item 2) + 1 * 79 (item 3) + 1 * 44 (item 4) + 3 * 24 (item 5) = 2 + 48 + 79 + 44 + 72 = 245\n            * Discounted value: 245 * 0.9 = 220.5. This is less than my outside offer of 272, so this is a bad offer for me.\n        *   **Counteroffer 3: Offer Player 1 the minimum from previous offers:** Offer Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n            * 3 * 1 (item 1) + 2 * 48 (item 2) + 2 * 79 (item 3) + 2 * 44 (item 4) + 6 * 24 (item 5) = 3 + 96 + 158 + 88 + 144 = 489.\n            * Discounted value: 489 * 0.9 = 440.1 This is better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] has a value of 0, which is much less than my outside offer of 272. Therefore, accepting is a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\nI will make a counteroffer. I'll offer the minimum of previous offers to player 1 which is [1,0,0,0,0]. This offer has a value to me of 489.\nDiscounting it gives us 489*0.9 = 440.1 which is greater than my outside option.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Value: 3 * 95 = 285\n    *   Item 3: Give 0, Keep 1. Value: 1 * 37 = 37\n    *   Item 4: Give 3, Keep 4. Value: 4 * 75 = 300\n    *   Item 5: Give 0, Keep 1. Value: 1 * 13 = 13\n    Total value = 130 + 285 + 37 + 300 + 13 = 765. This is below my outside offer value.\n\n    Lets consider:\n   *    Item 1: Give 3, Keep 6. Value: 6 * 26 = 156\n   *   Item 2: Give 1, Keep 4. Value: 4 * 95 = 380\n   *  Item 3: Give 0, Keep 1. Value: 1 * 37 = 37\n   *  Item 4: Give 2, Keep 5. Value: 5 * 75 = 375\n   *  Item 5: Give 0, Keep 1. Value: 1 * 13 = 13\n    Total value = 156 + 380 + 37 + 375 + 13 = 961. This is still below my outside offer value.\n\n    Lets consider:\n   *    Item 1: Give 2, Keep 7. Value: 7 * 26 = 182\n   *   Item 2: Give 1, Keep 4. Value: 4 * 95 = 380\n   *  Item 3: Give 0, Keep 1. Value: 1 * 37 = 37\n   *  Item 4: Give 1, Keep 6. Value: 6 * 75 = 450\n   *  Item 5: Give 0, Keep 1. Value: 1 * 13 = 13\n    Total value = 182 + 380 + 37 + 450 + 13 = 1062. This is above my outside offer value. This offer is a decent start.\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** I want an offer that keeps me above my outside offer (969).\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\n*   **Accept Current Offer:** There isn't one, so I can't accept.\n*   **Walk Away:** I can, but I think I can get a better deal if I make a reasonable counteroffer.\n*   **Propose Counteroffer:** Based on my calculations above, let's make the following offer: Give 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5, to Player 2. This would keep a total value of 1062 for me.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 520. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 555 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 520\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 42\n    *   Item 2: 41\n    *   Item 3: 7\n    *   Item 4: 9\n    *   Item 5: 86\n*   **Total items:**\n    *   Item 1: 9\n    *   Item 2: 5\n    *   Item 3: 1\n    *   Item 4: 7\n    *   Item 5: 1\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This means I keep:\n    * Item 1: 9 - 2 = 7\n    * Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4\n    * Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1\n    * Item 4: 7 - 1 = 6\n    * Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1\n    My value from accepting this offer: (7 * 42) + (4 * 41) + (1 * 7) + (6 * 9) + (1 * 86) = 294 + 164 + 7 + 54 + 86 = 605\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (605) is greater than my outside offer (520).\n* **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer better than my outside offer if i do not want to walk away. Given I have a better value from the current offer, I could make a worse offer and still remain above my outside option. However, offering less than what I currently have is a mistake, so I should propose an offer with a value of at least 605 or higher.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer has a value of 605, which is better than my outside option (520). Therefore, accepting would be a good move. However, I can also propose a counteroffer that is better for me. I could counteroffer in such a way that I get all the items, and Player 1 gets none.\n    This is:\n       * Item 1: 0\n       * Item 2: 0\n       * Item 3: 0\n       * Item 4: 0\n       * Item 5: 0\n    The value of this counteroffer for me is (9 * 42) + (5 * 41) + (1 * 7) + (7 * 9) + (1 * 86) = 378 + 205 + 7 + 63 + 86 = 739\n    This is better than the 605 from the current offer.\n\nGiven this analysis I will propose a counteroffer to get all the items, but I will be sure to offer a counter offer that is better for me than the current offer on the table in case the counteroffer is rejected. An offer of [2, 1, 0, 1, 0] yields me 605. Since gamma = 0.9, and there is only 2 rounds left, an offer of 605 would give 0.9*605 = 544.5. Therefore, I could give away a bit and still stay above the outside offer at a discount, but in case they counteroffer, I should stick close to the original deal value. I will offer them [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep\n* Item 1: 9 - 1 = 8\n    * Item 2: 5 - 0 = 5\n    * Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1\n    * Item 4: 7 - 0 = 7\n    * Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1\n    My value is: 8*42 + 5*41 + 1*7 + 7*9 + 1*86 = 336 + 205 + 7 + 63 + 86 = 699\n\nSo I propose the counteroffer of [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action for Player 1 in this first round.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is 236. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 13 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 35 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 13 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 10 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 5 per unit\n*   **Total Item Pool:**\n    *   3 units of Item 1\n    *   4 units of Item 2\n    *   2 units of Item 3\n    *   5 units of Item 4\n    *   6 units of Item 5\n*   **Discount Factor:** Gamma (\u03b3) = 0.9. This means that any deal made in later rounds is worth slightly less than it would be in earlier rounds (e.g., round 2 is worth 0.9 of round 1, round 3 worth 0.81 of round 1). Since it's the first round, the discount factor doesn't apply to this round's offers, but influences decisions about later rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** As Player 1, I need to consider what kind of counteroffer to propose. Since it is the first round, an aggressive offer in which I take most items is the appropriate strategy. The other player will not know my values, and I must start with a good offer to maximize my potential. If I offer 0 of all items, I get all of them.\n    * Keeping 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5 for myself:\n       * 3 * 13 = 39\n       * 4 * 35 = 140\n       * 2 * 13 = 26\n       * 5 * 10 = 50\n       * 6 * 5 = 30\n       * total = 285\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** My total item value of 285 is greater than my outside offer of 236. This means that I should attempt to get as much as possible. If a counteroffer is less than 236, it is worse than walking away.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   There is no current offer to accept.\n*   Walking away now would give me my outside offer of 236.\n*   Making an offer of all items means that I get all items.\n\nI should propose a counteroffer that gives nothing to the other player and I keep all items.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This means that if the process takes more rounds, the overall value to each player is reduced by a factor of 0.9 for each round of delay.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 of each item.  My value for this offer is:\n    (0 * 87) + (0 * 11) + (0 * 30) + (0 * 12) + (0 * 63) = 0\n    This is much less than my outside offer of 472.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate the value to myself for different proposed divisions. The total value to me if I keep all items is \n    (3 * 87) + (4 * 11) + (2 * 30) + (5 * 12) + (6 * 63) = 261 + 44 + 60 + 60 + 378 = 803.\n\n    Let's consider making a counteroffer where I propose keeping the majority of the items and offering player 1 a smaller portion of the items. For example, I offer Player 1 [1,1,1,1,1].\n\n    This means I keep [2,3,1,4,5]. My value is:\n    (2 * 87) + (3 * 11) + (1 * 30) + (4 * 12) + (5 * 63) = 174 + 33 + 30 + 48 + 315 = 600.\n    This is also larger than my outside offer of 472.\n    I can try to offer [0,1,0,1,1]. I keep [3,3,2,4,5]. My value is\n     (3 * 87) + (3 * 11) + (2 * 30) + (4 * 12) + (5 * 63) = 261 + 33 + 60 + 48 + 315= 717\n\n   Let's consider offering [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]. I keep [2, 2, 1, 3, 3]. My value is\n    (2 * 87) + (2 * 11) + (1 * 30) + (3 * 12) + (3 * 63) = 174 + 22 + 30 + 36 + 189 = 451\n    This is less than my outside offer value of 472.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** I need to make sure that the value of my counteroffer, if accepted, is higher than my outside offer of 472. It is also good to keep in mind that the value of the deal is discounted in future rounds.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is terrible for me. It's significantly worse than my outside offer, so I should not accept it.\nSince this is round 1, and I don't need to concede much to avoid having the deal discounted, I will make a counteroffer that keeps as much of the value as possible.

The discount factor will reduce the value of any deal reached in later rounds (it has no immediate effect in round 1).\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what kinds of counteroffers would be acceptable. I want to maximize my value while also ensuring that I don't make offers worse than my outside offer. Since it's round 1, I have room to try for a good deal before having to concede to a lower valued outcome in later rounds due to the discount. I should propose an offer that leaves me with value greater than 397. Since it is a first move, I should propose an offer that gives Player 2 a decent number of items to get the negotiation started.\n\n    Let's first calculate my total value if I kept all items for myself. This would be:\n    * Item 1: 7 * 21 = 147\n    * Item 2: 2 * 11 = 22\n    * Item 3: 5 * 47 = 235\n    * Item 4: 5 * 3 = 15\n    * Item 5: 5 * 25 = 125\n    * Total = 544\n\n    I want to keep more than my outside offer of 397 but also give the other player an incentive to negotiate. Let's try offering Player 2 a moderate amount of each item. How about 2 of each item? I'll calculate the value for myself:\n    *   Item 1: (7-2) * 21 = 105\n    *   Item 2: (2-2) * 11 = 0\n    *   Item 3: (5-2) * 47 = 141\n    *   Item 4: (5-2) * 3 = 9\n    *   Item 5: (5-2) * 25 = 75\n    *   Total = 330\n\n    This is lower than my outside offer, so this won't work. Let's try keeping 4 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 3 of item 5. \n     *   Item 1: 4 * 21 = 84\n    *   Item 2: 1 * 11 = 11\n    *   Item 3: 3 * 47 = 141\n    *   Item 4: 3 * 3 = 9\n    *   Item 5: 3 * 25 = 75\n    *   Total = 320. Again, this is below my outside offer.\n\nLet's try a different strategy. How about offering just 1 unit of item 1, item 2, and item 4, and 2 of items 3 and 5? This would leave me with:\n     * Item 1: (7-1) * 21 = 126\n    * Item 2: (2-1) * 11 = 11\n    * Item 3: (5-2) * 47 = 141\n    * Item 4: (5-1) * 3 = 12\n    * Item 5: (5-2) * 25 = 75\n    * Total = 365. Still not high enough.\n\nLet's be more aggressive and offer 1 unit of item 1, no units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, no units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This leaves me with\n     * Item 1: 6 * 21 = 126\n    * Item 2: 2 * 11 = 22\n    * Item 3: 4 * 47 = 188\n    * Item 4: 5 * 3 = 15\n    * Item 5: 4 * 25 = 100\n    * Total = 451. This works and is greater than 397. This seems like a reasonable opening offer.\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will propose a counteroffer to give Player 2: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] units.\n*   This gives me a value of 451, which is greater than my outside offer of 397.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1070\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 65\n    *   Item 2: 61\n    *   Item 3: 57\n    *   Item 4: 75\n    *   Item 5: 41\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 7\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that if a deal is reached in round 2, the value is multiplied by 0.9, and if a deal is reached in round 3, the value is multiplied by 0.9^2 = 0.81. So, a later deal is worth slightly less than an earlier deal.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 0 unit\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 0 unit\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit\n   My total value from this offer is (1 * 65) + (0 * 61) + (1 * 57) + (0 * 75) + (1 * 41) = 65 + 0 + 57 + 0 + 41 = 163. This is far less than my outside offer of 1070.\n    \n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer where I aim to keep a good portion of the items. A reasonable starting point is for each player to get approximately half the value. I can calculate my total item value by multiplying each item count by my value for each item: \n    (7 * 65) + (2 * 61) + (5 * 57) + (5 * 75) + (5 * 41) = 455 + 122 + 285 + 375 + 205 = 1442. Half of this value would be roughly 721.\n\n    I need to offer a portion of items to player 1, while keeping enough to make it worthwhile and better than my outside offer. I am going to propose a counteroffer giving the player 1 slightly less than half of all items to begin, which is: [3, 1, 2, 2, 2]. This will leave me with [4, 1, 3, 3, 3]. \n    My value if I were to get [4, 1, 3, 3, 3]: (4 * 65) + (1 * 61) + (3 * 57) + (3 * 75) + (3 * 41) = 260 + 61 + 171 + 225 + 123 = 840. This is not greater than my outside offer, which I want to avoid. Thus, I should keep more and reduce my offer to Player 1. \n\n    I will propose a counteroffer that gives a bit less than half to Player 1: [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]. This means I would keep [5, 2, 3, 4, 3]. \n    My value for keeping [5, 2, 3, 4, 3] = (5 * 65) + (2 * 61) + (3 * 57) + (4 * 75) + (3 * 41) = 325 + 122 + 171 + 300 + 123 = 1041. This is also below my outside offer.\n\n    I will propose a counteroffer that gives significantly less to player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], which is what Player 1 offered to me. This would leave me with [6, 2, 4, 5, 4], which has a value:\n    (6 * 65) + (2 * 61) + (4 * 57) + (5 * 75) + (4 * 41) = 390 + 122 + 228 + 375 + 164 = 1279. This is higher than my outside offer.\n    \n    I will revise the counteroffer to [2, 0, 1, 0, 1]. This will leave me with [5, 2, 4, 5, 4], which has a value:\n    (5 * 65) + (2 * 61) + (4 * 57) + (5 * 75) + (4 * 41) = 325 + 122 + 228 + 375 + 164 = 1214. This is also higher than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer (giving me a value of 163) is much worse than my outside offer of 1070. I will propose a counteroffer giving player 1 slightly less than half, but giving me a value greater than my outside offer, to avoid mistake 2.\n\nI will offer [2, 0, 1, 0, 1] to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on my action for round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 357\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 63\n    *   Item 2: 17\n    *   Item 3: 33\n    *   Item 4: 100\n    *   Item 5: 13\n*   **Total items:**\n    *   Item 1: 8\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 4\n    *   Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less to me than accepting the same offer in earlier rounds (e.g., an offer in round 2 is only worth 90% as much as round 1). This encourages finding a deal in the early rounds, since the value decreases by 10% every round that passes.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so there's no value to assess here.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what offers would be beneficial for me and also consider what the other player might be more willing to accept. Since this is round 1, I don't want to be too greedy or offer nothing and potentially end negotiations with a walk-away. I want to start with a reasonable offer. I'll calculate a few options:\n\n    *   **Option 1: 50/50 Split (roughly):** Give half of each item (or as close to half as possible) to Player 2.\n    *   Player 2 gets: [4, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n        *  I keep: [4, 2, 2, 2, 1] \n        * My Value: (4 * 63) + (2 * 17) + (2 * 33) + (2 * 100) + (1 * 13) = 252 + 34 + 66 + 200 + 13 = 565\n\n        *   **Option 2: Give slightly more to Player 2:** give a bit more of the less valuable items to Player 2.\n    *    Player 2 gets: [5, 3, 2, 2, 1]\n        *  I keep: [3, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n        * My Value: (3 * 63) + (1 * 17) + (1 * 33) + (2 * 100) + (1 * 13) = 189 + 17 + 33 + 200 + 13 = 452\n\n*   **Comparison to my outside offer:** Both of these options are significantly better than my outside offer of 357.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I shouldn't accept the current offer, as there is none to accept.\n*   I shouldn't walk away since I can potentially get a much better deal than my outside offer.\n*   I'll propose a counteroffer.

This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 8 - 4 = 4\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1\n    My value from accepting the current offer:\n    *  (4 * 63) + (3 * 17) + (2 * 33) + (3 * 100) + (1 * 13) = 252 + 51 + 66 + 300 + 13 = 682\n    Value adjusted for discount factor:\n     * 682 * 0.9^(2-1) = 682 * 0.9 = 613.8\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I'll consider a counteroffer that is fair, aiming to maximize my gain without being too greedy and causing player 2 to walk.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 613.8 to me, which is much better than my outside offer of 357. Therefore, I should not walk away, and I should not accept an offer worth less than 357.\n*   I am in round 2, and have already made an offer in round 1.\n*   Since I have rejected a previous offer, I should check that my counteroffer is not worse for me than the previous offer that I rejected. The previous offer I rejected was an offer of [4, 2, 1, 2, 1], meaning I would have received:\n   *   Item 1: 8-4=4\n   *   Item 2: 4-2=2\n   *   Item 3: 3-1=2\n   *   Item 4: 4-2=2\n   *   Item 5: 2-1=1\n   My value for this offer would have been: (4 * 63) + (2 * 17) + (2 * 33) + (2 * 100) + (1 * 13) = 252 + 34 + 66 + 200 + 13 = 565. This is less than my current offer. \n*   I want to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer and not worse than my last offer.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer: I will offer Player 2 slightly more of the items I value less and slightly less of the items I value more. My current offer is [4, 1, 1, 1, 1]. I will make an offer of [3, 2, 1, 2, 1]\nThis means I would keep:\n   *   Item 1: 8 - 3 = 5\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1\nMy value for this offer would be:\n    *  (5 * 63) + (2 * 17) + (2 * 33) + (2 * 100) + (1 * 13) = 315 + 34 + 66 + 200 + 13 = 628. This is greater than my outside offer of 357 and greater than the value for the previous offer made to me. \n\nGiven that the current offer has a higher discounted value than my outside offer, I should not walk away, and it is better to propose a counteroffer. I should also not accept an offer less than my outside offer, and my counteroffer should not be worse than my previous offer, and my counteroffer should not be worse than my outside offer, and I should not offer nothing or everything.\n\nTherefore, I will propose the counteroffer of [3, 2, 1, 2, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 148. This is my guaranteed fallback if we don't reach a deal.\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 24, Item 2: 48, Item 3: 82, Item 4: 66, Item 5: 46.\n*   **Total pool of items:** 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that the value of any deal reached in a later round is worth less than it would have been in the current round by the discount factor multiplied by (round number -1). For round 1 it is 0.9 ^ (1-1) = 1 so has no effect at this stage.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to calculate some potential divisions and see what I get.\n    *   **Example 1: Even Split.** Let's calculate the value of offering roughly half the items to Player 2 (and keeping half): I would keep 1 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 0.5 of item 4, and 3 of item 5. This is not possible given only integer quantities can be offered.  Let's try keeping 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5, offering the rest to player 2.\n        *   Value of kept items = (1 * 24) + (2 * 48) + (2 * 82) + (1 * 66) + (2 * 46) = 24 + 96 + 164 + 66 + 92 = 442\n    *   **Example 2: More aggressive offer**. Let's consider offering player 2 slightly less, keeping 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 4 of item 5 (offering the rest).\n        *   Value of kept items = (2*24) + (3 * 48) + (3 * 82) + (1 * 66) + (4 * 46) = 48 + 144 + 246 + 66 + 184 = 688.\n    *   **Example 3: Less aggressive offer**. Let's consider offering player 2 slightly more, keeping 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 1 of item 5 (offering the rest).\n        *   Value of kept items = (0 * 24) + (1* 48) + (1* 82) + (0 * 66) + (1* 46) = 0 + 48 + 82 + 0 + 46 = 176\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** All the options I have considered so far are much better than my outside offer of 148.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Since there is no current offer, I cannot accept anything.\n*   Walking away would mean receiving 148, which is suboptimal given my value for items.\n*   I should make a counteroffer. I want to propose something reasonable but still in my favor. Example 1 seemed like a reasonable starting point for negotiation, let's start there. I'll offer Player 2 1 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 2, 0, 3]}\n```\n",

That would be worth:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 24 = 48\n    *   5 units of item 2: 5 * 48 = 240\n    *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 82 = 328\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 66 = 66\n    *   5 units of item 5: 5 * 46 = 230\n    * Total = 912\n\nI could propose a new offer that gives player 2 the minimum number of items and still leave my outside offer beat. If I offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] to Player 2 then I keep:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 24 = 48\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 48 = 192\n    *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 82 = 328\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 66 = 66\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 46 = 184\n    *   Total: 818\n    * Discounted value is 818 * 0.9 = 736.2\nThis is more than my previous best offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer (482.4) is better than my outside offer (148).\n*   I can make an offer better than the previous one, that also beats the outside offer.\n*   I will make a counteroffer that gives [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] to the opponent.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 396\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 69, Item 2: 81, Item 3: 11, Item 4: 71, Item 5: 74\n*   **Total pool of items:** 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal agreed upon in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times the value of the outcome for that round for me.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 69) + (1 * 81) + (0 * 11) + (0 * 71) + (1 * 74) = 81 + 74 = 155\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 155 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 155 * 0.9 = 139.5\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I want to make an offer that is better than my outside offer of 396 after discounting. Because this is round two, I need the actual undiscounted value of my offer to be greater than 396/0.9 = 440. Given that this is round 2, I will try to make a strong offer now to get a deal done. In the next round my values will be further reduced.\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer that aims to give player 1 a minimal amount to increase my own portion significantly. Lets examine if I take all items except the current offer and provide the minimum:\n    * My offer to player 1: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] - same as current\n    * My retained: [2, 4, 4, 1, 4]\n    * My value: (2 * 69) + (4 * 81) + (4 * 11) + (1 * 71) + (4 * 74) = 138 + 324 + 44 + 71 + 296 = 873\n    This has a discounted value of 873 * 0.9 = 785.7, so is good for me.\n    Let's offer Player 1 a more balanced offer: [1, 2, 2, 0, 2]\n     * My retained: [1, 3, 2, 1, 3]\n    *  My value: (1*69) + (3*81) + (2*11) + (1*71) + (3*74) = 69 + 243 + 22 + 71 + 222 = 627\n    This is still better than 440 and is fair, so it is ok.\n\n     Let me examine [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n     * My retained: [1, 3, 3, 1, 4]\n     * My value: (1*69) + (3*81) + (3*11) + (1*71) + (4*74) = 69 + 243 + 33 + 71 + 296 = 712\n     This still seems reasonable, so lets do it. \n\n    \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    * The discounted value of accepting the current offer is 139.5, which is worse than my outside offer of 396.\n    * My proposed counteroffer is better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of 139.5 is worse than my outside offer of 396. I should not ACCEPT.\n*   I have found a good counteroffer that yields a high value and gives something reasonable to player 1: [1, 2, 1, 0, 1] which makes my value 712 which is greater than 440.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer [1, 2, 1, 0, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on my first action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 474. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item values:** My private values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 79\n    *   Item 2: 66\n    *   Item 3: 37\n    *   Item 4: 43\n    *   Item 5: 43\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 10 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1.0. This means that the present value of any offer is the same as the nominal value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to propose an initial offer. I want to maximize my value, but also ensure the other player has something to gain so they don't walk away. I don't want to offer no items, all items or an offer less than my outside offer. Therefore, I'm going to aim for a roughly balanced initial offer, making sure I keep enough for myself to stay above my outside offer.\n\n    Let's consider offering the other player half of each item (or close to half since some items have odd quantities). Specifically:\n    * Offer Player 2: 2 units of Item 1, 5 units of Item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, and 1 unit of Item 5.\n\n    This would leave me with:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit\n\n    My value for this offer would be:\n    * 2 * 79 = 158\n    * 5 * 66 = 330\n    * 1 * 37 = 37\n    * 2 * 43 = 86\n    * 1 * 43 = 43\n    Total = 158 + 330 + 37 + 86 + 43 = 654\n\n    Since 654 is greater than 474, this is a valid offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n* I will make a counteroffer as there is no current offer on the table, and I want to start negotiations.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 5, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round. Specifically, an offer in round r is worth 0.9^(r-1) times the value of the goods received\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer gives me 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n    *   My value from this offer = (0 * 26) + (0 * 37) + (1 * 64) + (1 * 9) + (0 * 81) = 73\n    *   My discounted value from the current offer = 73 * 0.9^(1-1) = 73 * 1 = 73\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer where I propose to give the other player 1 of each item except item 5, which would give the player 1 unit of items 1, 2, 3 and 4 and I keep the rest. This gives me: \n    *   2 of item 1, value = 2 * 26 = 52\n    *   2 of item 2, value = 2 * 37 = 74\n    *   4 of item 3, value = 4 * 64 = 256\n    *   4 of item 4, value = 4 * 9 = 36\n    *   3 of item 5, value = 3 * 81 = 243\n    *   Total value = 52 + 74 + 256 + 36 + 243 = 661\n    This is a high value, above the outside offer.\n    Alternatively, a very aggressive offer would be for me to keep everything.\n    Another alternative is to give only item 4, giving me:\n    * 3 of item 1, value = 3 * 26 = 78\n    * 3 of item 2, value = 3 * 37 = 111\n    * 5 of item 3, value = 5 * 64 = 320\n    * 4 of item 4, value = 4 * 9 = 36\n    * 3 of item 5, value = 3 * 81 = 243\n    * Total value = 78 + 111 + 320 + 36 + 243 = 788\n    Let's look at what happens if I give him 1 of item 3 and 1 of item 4, as in the current offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 979.\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 86, Item 2: 54, Item 3: 87, Item 4: 50, Item 5: 46.\n*   **Total pool of items:** 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means that any outcome we accept now is multiplied by 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 86 = 86\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 54 = 54\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 87 = 87\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 50 = 50\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 46 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer = 86 + 54 + 87 + 50 + 0 = 277.\n    *   Discounted value of accepting current offer = 277 * 0.9 = 249.3\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Before considering concrete counteroffers, we must remember that the value is discounted by 0.9, if we accept now, and by 0 if the game goes to round 3 (as there are no more rounds). In the final round we would accept our outside value. So a counteroffer in this round should be worth > 979/0.9 = 1087.78 approximately. To calculate some, let us calculate what happens if we take everything.\n     *   3 units of item 1 = 3 * 86 = 258\n    *   3 units of item 2 = 3 * 54 = 162\n    *   5 units of item 3 = 5 * 87 = 435\n    *   5 units of item 4 = 5 * 50 = 250\n    *   3 units of item 5 = 3 * 46 = 138\n    *   Total value of taking all items = 258+162+435+250+138 = 1243.\n     * For example, if I offer Player 2, 0 of everything this round I get 1243 * 0.9 = 1118.7.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (249.3) is significantly lower than my outside offer (979). This means I should not accept it.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer (249.3) is much worse than my outside offer (979). If we walk away we get 979 and if we make a counteroffer, it may be rejected by the other player and in that case, we will only get 979, so we should make a counteroffer that will give us a value higher than that if it's accepted, otherwise we are better walking away. Based on this, lets propose a counteroffer that is very favourable to us, with the intent that if the other player rejects it, we just accept the outside offer value on the next round. In this round, let us offer the player [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]. That leaves me with [2, 2, 3, 3, 2]. The value of this to us is:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 86 = 172\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 54 = 108\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 87 = 261\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 50 = 150\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 46 = 92\n    *  Total value: 783\n    Discounted Value of Counter Offer if accepted: 783 * 0.9 = 704.7\nThis is worse than our outside offer. So we should not propose it. Let us propose to the other player [0, 0, 1, 1, 0].\nThat leaves us with [3, 3, 4, 4, 3]. The value of this to us is:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 86 = 258\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 54 = 162\n    *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 87 = 348\n    *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 50 = 200\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 46 = 138\n    *   Total value: 1106\n     Discounted Value of counteroffer if accepted: 1106 * 0.9 = 995.4 > 979. This is better than the outside value, so let's make this offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

Since it is round 2, if a deal is made this round, it will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 1, 1, 0].

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 4, 2, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 2, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 669. This is my guaranteed fallback if we don't reach an agreement.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 52 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 62 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 82 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 59 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 56 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   3 units of item 1\n    *   6 units of item 2\n    *   3 units of item 3\n    *   6 units of item 4\n    *   4 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 2, if a deal is made this round, our value will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [2, 4, 2, 4, 0]. This means I would get:\n    * 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 52 = 104\n    * 4 units of item 2 = 4 * 62 = 248\n    * 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 82 = 164\n    * 4 units of item 4 = 4 * 59 = 236\n    * 0 units of item 5 = 0 * 56 = 0\n    Total value from current offer: 104 + 248 + 164 + 236 + 0 = 752\n    The discounted value of this offer if we accept in this round is 752 * 0.9 = 676.8\n\n    Compared to my outside offer of 669, accepting the current offer is better for me because 676.8 > 669.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few potential counteroffers and their values.  It seems reasonable to try for something better than what I am currently getting. It may be beneficial to ask for more of item 3 as that has a high value. Let's examine a couple of counteroffers to see what they are worth:\n    *   **Counteroffer 1: [1, 2, 1, 2, 0]** (give this to Player 2) which means I get [2,4,2,4,4]\n        *   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 52 = 104\n        *   4 units of item 2 = 4 * 62 = 248\n        *   2 units of item 3 = 2 * 82 = 164\n        *   4 units of item 4 = 4 * 59 = 236\n        *   4 units of item 5 = 4 * 56 = 224\n        Total value to me: 104 + 248 + 164 + 236 + 224 = 976\n    *   **Counteroffer 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]** (give this to Player 2) which means I get [3,6,3,6,4]\n        *   3 units of item 1 = 3 * 52 = 156\n        *   6 units of item 2 = 6 * 62 = 372\n        *   3 units of item 3 = 3 * 82 = 246\n        *   6 units of item 4 = 6 * 59 = 354\n        *   4 units of item 5 = 4 * 56 = 224\n        Total value to me: 156 + 372 + 246 + 354 + 224 = 1352\n        It's worth pointing out that this counteroffer would be mistake 3\n\n    These would lead to discounted values of 976*0.9 = 878.4 and 1352*0.9 = 1216.8 respectively if they were accepted in this round. Counteroffer 2 is not optimal because it gives nothing to my opponent. We should aim to ask for better than the current offer. Let's pick Counteroffer 1 because it still asks for something better while offering something to the opponent.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is better than my outside offer (676.8 > 669), so walking away is suboptimal\n*   I can make an offer that is better for me than the current offer\n*   I will propose the counteroffer [1, 2, 1, 2, 0]. This gives me a value of 976, or a discounted value of 878.4 if it's accepted in this round.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 2, 0]}\n```\n",

I want to aim for an offer that keeps most of the value for myself while also being enticing enough for Player 2 to not immediately walk away. It is not desirable to offer nothing, so I won't do that. I also won't offer everything, that would be clearly suboptimal.\n\nI will consider a few options to figure out an ideal initial offer:\n\n*   **Option 1:** Offer half of each item. This may be a good starting point. This translates to:\n     *   1 unit of item 1 for Player 2 (keeping 1 unit for myself)\n     *   2.5 units of item 2 for Player 2 (keeping 2.5 for myself)\n     *   5 units of item 3 for Player 2 (keeping 5 for myself)\n     *   2 units of item 4 for Player 2 (keeping 2 for myself)\n     *   2.5 units of item 5 for Player 2 (keeping 2.5 for myself)\n    This isn't possible, as items cannot be split. I need to modify this.\n*   **Option 2:** Offer Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. This is almost half the total items.\n    * This would leave me with: 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    * My value would be (1 * 39) + (3 * 51) + (5 * 20) + (2 * 34) + (3 * 15) = 39 + 153 + 100 + 68 + 45 = 405\n*  **Option 3:** Offer player 2 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5.\n   * This would leave me with 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n   * My value would be (2 * 39) + (4 * 51) + (7 * 20) + (3 * 34) + (4 * 15) = 78 + 204 + 140 + 102 + 60 = 584\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** All of the above offers leave me with a total value greater than my outside offer of 28.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that receiving a payoff later is worth less than receiving the same payoff now. In round 1, gamma is 0.9^(1-1) = 1, so there is no discount.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 0, 3, 3, 3]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 7 - 3 = 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n\n    My value for this offer is:\n    (3 * 88) + (1 * 33) + (3 * 5) + (4 * 54) + (3 * 49) = 264 + 33 + 15 + 216 + 147 = 675\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (675) is less than my outside offer (1066).\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    Let's calculate the maximum possible value I could achieve, which is keeping all items for myself:\n    (6 * 88) + (1 * 33) + (6 * 5) + (7 * 54) + (6 * 49) = 528 + 33 + 30 + 378 + 294 = 1263\n    I need to propose an offer which results in a value greater than 1066 for myself.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer (675) is worse than my outside offer (1066).\n*   Accepting would be a mistake 4, and I would violate mistake 5 if I walked away from an offer better than my outside offer when none exists.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, and will be beneficial to both parties to make sure Player 1 doesn't walk.\n*   Given the discount factor being 1 for this round, there is no advantage in delaying an agreement that would be good for both parties.\n\nLet's aim for an offer which keeps most of the items that are valuable to me and offers the rest to Player 1. I will aim for a value for myself of above 1100.\nI will try to give most of item 3, the least valued item to me, to player 1, also some of the less valuable of the others.\nLet's try offering [2, 0, 4, 2, 2].

This is worse than my outside offer. Let's propose a different offer.\n\nLet's try an offer of [1,0,5,1,1]. This gives me:\n5 units of item 1: 5 * 88 = 440\n1 unit of item 2: 1 * 33 = 33\n1 unit of item 3: 1 * 5 = 5\n6 units of item 4: 6 * 54 = 324\n5 units of item 5: 5 * 49 = 245\nTotal Value = 440 + 33 + 5 + 324 + 245 = 1047, this is still worse than my outside offer.\nLet's try [0,0,6,0,0], which gives me:\n6 units of item 1: 6 * 88 = 528\n1 unit of item 2: 1 * 33 = 33\n0 units of item 3: 0 * 5 = 0\n7 units of item 4: 7 * 54 = 378\n6 units of item 5: 6 * 49 = 294\nTotal Value = 528 + 33 + 0 + 378 + 294 = 1233.

This means that any deal made in round 2 will have its value multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 0, 6, 0, 0].

Accounting for the discount factor of 0.9: 1388 * 0.9 = 1249.2.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's consider an offer that's more balanced, to avoid mistake 3 (offering 0 or all items). Perhaps offering 3 of each item would be a good starting point. Let's calculate my value if I keep 3 of each item (when possible):\n    * Item 1: 3 * 41 = 123\n    * Item 2: 0 * 46 = 0 (because I would give my one unit to player 2)\n    * Item 3: 3 * 28 = 84\n    * Item 4: 3 * 76 = 228\n    * Item 5: 3 * 94 = 282\n    My total value is 123 + 0 + 84 + 228 + 282 = 717.

Multiplying by 0.9 for discount = 901.8\n\n    Let's consider a counter offer that gives 2 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5 to player 2. This means I would keep 4 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n    My total value would be 1002, with the discount factor 901.8\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n    * The current offer, when discounted, is worth 1249.2, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 533.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], which nets me a discounted value of 1249.2 is much better than my outside offer of 533.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on my first action.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is 631. This is my guaranteed fallback option if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 82\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 97\n    *   Item 4: 7\n    *   Item 5: 88\n*   **Total Items:**\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that a deal made in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the same deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value of the same deal in round 1. This makes it advantageous to strike a deal as early as possible.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since it is the first round, I am making the initial offer. I need to decide on a division. A good starting point is to try to get at least half of the total value. My total value is 755. I should consider making an offer that gives some to the other player while ensuring my offer is above my outside offer value of 631. The sum of all items is 14 so giving 7 to the other player and keeping 7 will roughly equal to half of the items. Therefore I will offer 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\n    If I make the offer [0, 2, 1, 1, 2], my kept values are:\n    * Item 1: 1 * 82 = 82\n    * Item 2: 2 * 4 = 8\n    * Item 3: 2 * 97 = 194\n    * Item 4: 1 * 7 = 7\n    * Item 5: 2 * 88 = 176\n    Total Value = 467\n\n    That is too low. I should instead offer 0 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 units of item 5\n   If I make the offer [0, 1, 1, 0, 1], my kept values are:\n    * Item 1: 1 * 82 = 82\n    * Item 2: 3 * 4 = 12\n    * Item 3: 2 * 97 = 194\n    * Item 4: 2 * 7 = 14\n    * Item 5: 3 * 88 = 264\n    Total Value = 566\n    This is not greater than my outside offer, which is bad, but the alternative is walking away now which is bad.\n\n    Let me recalculate what value the other agent will get for each of the items if I make that offer. \n    If I make the offer [0, 1, 1, 0, 1], they will get:\n    Item 1: 0\n    Item 2: 1 unit\n    Item 3: 1 unit\n    Item 4: 0\n    Item 5: 1 unit\n    The maximum they can get will be (101 * 1) + (101 * 4) + (101 * 3) + (101*2) + (101*4) = 101*14 = 1414\n\n    Let me make a new offer. I will offer [0,1,0,0,0] to the other player.\n    If I make the offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], my kept values are:\n    * Item 1: 1 * 82 = 82\n    * Item 2: 3 * 4 = 12\n    * Item 3: 3 * 97 = 291\n    * Item 4: 2 * 7 = 14\n    * Item 5: 4 * 88 = 352\n    Total Value = 751\n    This is greater than my outside offer and does not involve offering everything which is good.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer because there is no current offer\n*   I should not walk away because I can make an initial offer that is higher than my outside offer.\n*   I will make the counteroffer that I give the other player 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This means that accepting an offer later in the game reduces the value compared to accepting it earlier.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].

Let's consider a few:\n    *   **Giving nothing to Player 1** (keeping all items): This gives a value of 74+328+39+186+240=867 (This offer is potentially better than the current offer and outside option but has a high risk of being rejected by player 1 and ending up in a walk outcome in future rounds).\n    * **Offer Player 1 1 unit of item 2:** This gives me a value of 74 + 246 + 39 + 186 + 240 = 785, This is similar to the current offer on the table.\n    * **Offering Player 1 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5:** This gives me a value of 0 + 164 + 26 + 93 + 180 = 463\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer (785) is slightly better than my outside offer of 783. Therefore, accepting the offer is a reasonable option. However, making a counteroffer might lead to a more favorable deal. Let's try a moderate counteroffer hoping Player 1 will accept it. If the counteroffer is rejected I can still choose my outside offer in the next round. Offering too much or too little might lead to a suboptimal result. Let's offer Player 1 a single unit of item 2.\n    *   My value for this counteroffer is still 785\n\n**Decision:** Since the current offer is slightly better than my outside offer but might yield a better return, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 783. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 966 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since this is round 2, if no agreement is reached, the next round will be the final one, where I cannot make a counteroffer. I want to avoid walking away if I can get a better offer. So, I need to consider an offer that gives player 1 a reasonable amount while still letting me keep a sufficient amount to be above my outside option.\n    *   If I propose a counteroffer of [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] I keep:\n        * 1 unit of Item 1 = 1 * 74 = 74\n        * 3 units of Item 2 = 3 * 82 = 246\n        * 3 units of Item 3 = 3 * 13 = 39\n        * 2 units of Item 4 = 2 * 93 = 186\n        * 4 units of Item 5 = 4 * 60 = 240\n        * Total = 785\n        * Discounted value: 785 * 0.9 = 706.5 (less than my outside offer - mistake 2)\n    *   If I propose a counteroffer of [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] I keep:\n        * 1 unit of Item 1 = 1 * 74 = 74\n        * 3 units of Item 2 = 3 * 82 = 246\n        * 3 units of Item 3 = 3 * 13 = 39\n        * 1 units of Item 4 = 1 * 93 = 93\n        * 3 units of Item 5 = 3 * 60 = 180\n        * Total = 632\n        * Discounted value: 632 * 0.9 = 568.8 (less than my outside offer - mistake 2)\n\nLet me try to ensure I don't make mistake 2 and that I don't make mistake 3. \n\n*   If I counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]: I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 74 = 74\n    *   Item 2: 4 * 82 = 328\n    *   Item 3: 3 * 13 = 39\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 93 = 186\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 60 = 240\n    *   Total = 867\n    *   Discounted value = 867 * 0.9 = 780.3 (still less than my outside offer - mistake 2). \n\nThis shows that with the current discount, I need to give very little away to at least match my outside offer.\n\n*  If I counteroffer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]: I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 74 = 74\n    *   Item 2: 4 * 82 = 328\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 13 = 26\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 93 = 186\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 60 = 240\n    *   Total = 854\n    *   Discounted value: 854 * 0.9 = 768.6 (less than my outside offer - mistake 2)\n\nSince I am losing too much value from the discount, I will make a very greedy counteroffer that leaves me with at least my outside offer.

This means that any deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 times its value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 3, 2, 0]. This means I get to keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n\n    The total value of the current offer to me is:\n    (3 * 38) + (1 * 56) + (3 * 68) + (3 * 96) + (1 * 81) = 114 + 56 + 204 + 288 + 81 = 743\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    Let's consider a potential counteroffer that attempts to get close to half the items. Since there are 5 item types, and it is not possible to split fractions, let us propose giving them the following: [2, 0, 3, 2, 0]. Then, I would keep [3, 2, 3, 3, 1], with a value of 743.\n    If I offer them [3, 1, 3, 3, 0], I keep [2, 1, 3, 2, 1]. The value would be:\n    (2*38) + (1*56) + (3*68) + (2*96) + (1*81) = 76 + 56 + 204 + 192 + 81 = 609\n    If I offer them [2, 1, 2, 1, 0], I keep [3, 1, 4, 4, 1]. The value would be:\n    (3*38) + (1*56) + (4*68) + (4*96) + (1*81) = 114 + 56 + 272 + 384 + 81 = 907\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer's value (743) is much greater than my outside offer value (92).\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is significantly better than my outside offer.\n*   Making a counteroffer now could risk a walk in the next round since it will be the final round. It does not make sense to try and squeeze out additional value, given how much better the current offer is than the outside offer.\n*   Therefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This means any deal we make will be worth less in future rounds.

This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    My value for this offer is:\n    *   4 * 98 + 5 * 26 + 5 * 64 + 1 * 55 + 1 * 7 = 392 + 130 + 320 + 55 + 7 = 904\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    I want to consider counteroffers that are better than my outside offer value of 466 and avoid making mistakes 1-5.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 904 to me, which is much greater than my outside offer of 466. Therefore, accepting would be beneficial, unless I believe I can get even more in a later round. However, I should consider what the result would be if the other agent was rational (at least in the early rounds).\nIn an optimal outcome for me I would receive close to the total value less the outside value of player 1 which we don't know, but it is certainly not 0. So we should consider that in order to receive this I may have to give up something. \n\nMy total value for all items is 1092. Player 1 offered [1,1,1,0,0] which is quite low. \nI will make a counteroffer that is in between their offer and taking everything. It should also be better than my outside offer. \nLet's consider giving the other player 2 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5. \nThis means I would have:\n3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 1 of item 5\n3*98 + 5*26 + 5*64 + 1*55 + 1*7 = 294 + 130 + 320 + 55 + 7 = 806\n806 > 466\n\nTherefore, I will make this counteroffer to maximize my gain.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Since we are in round 2, if a deal is made now, the value will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer on the table is that I get [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My value for this offer is:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 98 = 98\n    *   Total value of current offer: 98\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 98 * 0.9 = 88.2\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider the value of my counteroffer. Let's do some examples.\n\n    *   *Example Counteroffer 1*: Offer [2, 1, 1, 0, 0] to player 1. This means I get 3 items of type 1, 5 items of type 2, 5 items of type 3, 1 item of type 4 and 1 item of type 5:\n        *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 98 = 294\n        *   5 units of item 2: 5 * 26 = 130\n        *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 64 = 320\n        *   1 units of item 4: 1 * 55 = 55\n        *   1 units of item 5: 1 * 7 = 7\n        *   Total value = 806\n    *   *Example Counteroffer 2*: Offer [1, 1, 1, 0, 0] to player 1.

Accepting it would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n*   Walking away now would give me 466, which is better than the current offer, but there are potentially better offers.\n*   It is better to make a counteroffer. I will go with the best counteroffer I could make, which involves asking for everything except 1 unit of each. The other player is unlikely to accept that. A more reasonable counteroffer would be to go back to the first counteroffer that I made: [2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1045. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1038 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 1045.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 75\n    *   Item 2: 97\n    *   Item 3: 65\n    *   Item 4: 17\n    *   Item 5: 92\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. Since this is round 3, the discount factor will be 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [2, 1, 1, 0, 0], meaning I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n\n    My value for the current offer is:\n    (3 * 75) + (5 * 97) + (5 * 65) + (1 * 17) + (1 * 92) = 225 + 485 + 325 + 17 + 92 = 1144\n    Since this is round 3, the discounted value is: 1144 * 0.81 = 926.64\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** It is round 3, the last round of negotiation. If I do not accept the current offer, there will be no more opportunities for counteroffers since Player 2 cannot make a counteroffer on round 3. Thus a counteroffer will be treated as walking away.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer has a discounted value of 926.64 which is less than my outside offer of 1045.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nSince the current offer (after discounting) is less than my outside option, I should not accept it.  Furthermore, I am on round 3, so a counteroffer will lead to the negotiations ending without a deal and both parties taking their outside options. Therefore, I should take my outside option.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the items, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value of the items, in round 4 its worth 0.729 of the value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so accepting is not an option.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  Since this is the first round, I'll propose a division of items that favors me but still leaves the other player with value so they will not immediately walk. I will start by assuming they have the same value on the items.\n    A split where I keep the majority will be good for me.\n\n    Let's calculate a couple of scenarios to demonstrate the approach:\n    *    **Scenario 1: I offer Player 2 one unit of each item**\n          My units:\n           4 units of item 1 = 4 * 77 = 308\n           1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 93 = 93\n           3 units of item 3 = 3 * 30 = 90\n           1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 49 = 49\n           4 unit of item 5 = 4 * 22 = 88\n           Total value = 628\n           This is lower than my outside offer. I need to offer them less so that i can get more value.\n    *    **Scenario 2: I offer Player 2 the minimum:**\n          This would be offering one unit of item 2 and item 4\n           My units:\n           5 units of item 1 = 5 * 77 = 385\n           1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 93 = 93\n           4 units of item 3 = 4 * 30 = 120\n           1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 49 = 49\n           5 unit of item 5 = 5 * 22 = 110\n           Total value = 757\n           This offer is greater than my outside offer of 720, but it might be considered too greedy by the other player.\n           \n    *    **Scenario 3: I offer Player 2 one unit of item 3 and one unit of item 5:**\n          My units:\n           5 units of item 1 = 5 * 77 = 385\n           2 unit of item 2 = 2 * 93 = 186\n           3 units of item 3 = 3 * 30 = 90\n           2 unit of item 4 = 2 * 49 = 98\n           4 unit of item 5 = 4 * 22 = 88\n           Total value = 847\n           This is better than my outside offer, while still giving value to the other player.\n\n    It is important to note, there is a risk they walk, however, this risk is minimized as the other player receives value.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will propose the counteroffer from Scenario 3, giving one unit of item 3 and one unit of item 5 to Player 2.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

This would mean I keep:\n        * 4 units of item 1: 4 * 84 = 336\n        * 2 units of item 2: 2 * 54 = 108\n        * 3 units of item 3: 3 * 49 = 147\n        * 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 10 = 10\n        * 3 units of item 5: 3 * 43 = 129\n        * My total value = 336 + 108 + 147 + 10 + 129 = 730\n    *   This is more than my outside option, 445, so it is a viable option. Let's compare with other counteroffers later on in the process if required.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 92 to me which is less than my outside offer of 445. Therefore, I will not accept it.\n*   I will not walk away as I can propose a counteroffer worth more than my outside offer.\n*   I will make a counteroffer proposing that I receive 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 3 of item 5.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 720\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 77, Item 2: 93, Item 3: 30, Item 4: 49, Item 5: 22\n*   **Total items:** 5 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 2, the discount factor for this round is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]. This means they're keeping 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 of item 5. The value of this offer to me is:\n    (1 * 77) + (0 * 93) + (1 * 30) + (1 * 49) + (2 * 22) = 77 + 0 + 30 + 49 + 44 = 200\n    The discounted value of the current offer is 200 * 0.9 = 180\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer value of 180 is less than my outside offer value of 720.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to create a counteroffer that is better for me than my outside option (taking into account the discount factor). Given the negotiation history, my prior offer to the other player was [0, 0, 1, 0, 1], they countered with [1, 0, 1, 1, 2] .  Let's think about what we could achieve. I would like to propose a new offer, giving away as little as possible while ensuring I get at least my outside offer value. Let's consider giving back what the player wanted from our previous offer in round 1, plus an additional unit of item 3, and keep the rest. This means offering [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]. \n    The value of this for me would be (4 * 77) + (2 * 93) + (2 * 30) + (2 * 49) + (4 * 22) = 308 + 186 + 60 + 98 + 88 = 740\n    The discounted value is 740 * 0.9 = 666. This is below our outside offer, therefore not optimal. \n    Let's adjust it. How about offering [0, 0, 1, 0, 1].  This was our offer in round 1, perhaps the other player would accept the reversal of what they had previously wanted.\n    The value of this to me is (5 * 77) + (2 * 93) + (3 * 30) + (2 * 49) + (4 * 22) = 385 + 186 + 90 + 98 + 88 = 847.\n    The discounted value is 847 * 0.9 = 762.3. This is greater than our outside offer value, and not offering a zero quantity, so it seems like a good choice.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer (180) is significantly worse than my outside offer (720).\n*   The value of keeping  [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] to the other player (762.3) is better than my outside offer, so it makes sense to propose it as a counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

This counteroffer gives me a value of 488.7, while my outside offer is 445.\n\nGiven that this is the last round, and the counteroffer will effectively be treated as a walk away since I'm player 2 making a counteroffer in round 3, it would be best to propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer in the hope that Player 1 accepts. This is not risky as I know that it will be treated as a walk away from my perspective. So, I will try to make a counteroffer that gives me a reasonably high value and see if it is accepted (knowing that regardless, I will get my outside offer if the offer is rejected).

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus any counteroffer will result in a payoff of my outside offer 720.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\n*   The discounted value of accepting the current offer (404.19) is significantly lower than my outside offer (720).\n*   Since any counteroffer will be treated as a walk and give me 720, there is no point in making a counteroffer.\n*   Therefore, I should WALK away.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 743. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1113 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 743\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 39\n    *   Item 2: 95\n    *   Item 3: 66\n    *   Item 4: 90\n    *   Item 5: 81\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 1\n    *   Item 5: 7\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 has its value multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. Offers accepted in round 3 will be discounted more.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 3]. This means I keep [3, 3, 3, 1, 4]. Let's calculate the value:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 39 = 117\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 95 = 285\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 66 = 198\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 90 = 90\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 81 = 324\n    *   Total Value: 117 + 285 + 198 + 90 + 324 = 1014\n    *   Discounted Value in round 2 = 1014 * 0.9 = 912.6\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (912.6) is greater than my outside offer value (743). Therefore, this offer is good for me.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffer calculations:**\n    The previous offer I made to player 2 in round 1 was [2, 2, 2, 0, 3]. Let us consider offering [2, 2, 2, 0, 3] again. This means I keep [2, 2, 2, 1, 4]\n    * 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 39 = 78\n    * 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 95 = 190\n    * 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 66 = 132\n    * 1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 90 = 90\n    * 4 units of item 5 = 4 * 81 = 324\n    * Total Value: 78 + 190 + 132 + 90 + 324 = 814\n    * Discounted Value: 814 * 0.9 = 732.6\n    This offer is worse than the current offer and worse than our outside offer, so we should not offer it.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer on the table gives me a discounted value of 912.6, which is better than my outside option of 743.  Therefore, I should accept the offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This means that any deal we reach will be multiplied by 0.9 to the power of (r-1), where r is the round the deal was struck. It's better to get a deal now than later if the value is relatively similar.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer, so I cannot accept anything at this stage.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to decide what I'll offer to Player 2. I want to keep as much value as possible without triggering them to walk away or making them a better offer than my outside offer and avoid making any of the 5 mistakes listed above. An initial offer will need to take into account the total value of items, which I calculate below:\n    *   3 * 66 = 198 (Item 1)\n    *   2 * 79 = 158 (Item 2)\n    *   5 * 12 = 60 (Item 3)\n    *   7 * 81 = 567 (Item 4)\n    *   5 * 35 = 175 (Item 5)\n        *   Total value = 198 + 158 + 60 + 567 + 175 = 1158\n    I am not going to offer them half of everything, as that would be too generous. I will start by offering them a relatively small proportion of the items to see if they counter-offer with something more beneficial to me.\n        *   Offer 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2. This would leave me with:\n            *   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 66 = 132\n            *   2 units of item 2 = 2 * 79 = 158\n            *   4 units of item 3 = 4 * 12 = 48\n            *   5 units of item 4 = 5 * 81 = 405\n            *   4 units of item 5 = 4 * 35 = 140\n            *   Total Value for me = 132 + 158 + 48 + 405 + 140 = 883\n        *   If I offered 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 to Player 2 I would be left with all 1158. However, this is very likely to lead to a walk by Player 2 so it's not a good starting position.\n        *   My outside offer is 455.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will propose my chosen counteroffer of 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2.

My value if I accept this offer is:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 49 = 49\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 46 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 69 = 69\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 97 = 194\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 6 = 6\n    *   Total value of current offer: 49 + 0 + 69 + 194 + 6 = 318\n\n    This is less than my outside offer of 395.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**  Let's consider a counteroffer that aims to give Player 1 a reasonable amount while still getting more for myself than the current offer and my outside offer. Here's a sample counteroffer with its value:\n     *   Player 1 gets [1, 0, 1, 2, 0] (this is what they currently have). I would then receive [2, 2, 4, 5, 5].\n          *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 49 = 98\n          *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 46 = 92\n          *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 69 = 276\n          *   5 units of item 4: 5 * 97 = 485\n          *   5 units of item 5: 5 * 6 = 30\n           *   Total value: 98 + 92 + 276 + 485 + 30 = 981.\n   \n     I can also try to be more aggressive by only giving Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], resulting in an offer to me of [3, 2, 5, 7, 5]:\n          *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 49 = 147\n          *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 46 = 92\n          *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 69 = 345\n          *   7 units of item 4: 7 * 97 = 679\n          *   5 units of item 5: 5 * 6 = 30\n          *   Total value: 147 + 92 + 345 + 679 + 30 = 1293.\n\n    This gives me a better value than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of 318 is less than my outside offer of 395. Therefore, I should not accept the offer.\n*   I should not walk away as I can potentially get a better outcome.\n*   I should make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. Let's propose a more aggressive counteroffer to maximize my payoff: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 455.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 66\n    *   Item 2: 79\n    *   Item 3: 12\n    *   Item 4: 81\n    *   Item 5: 35\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 7\n    *   Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since we are in round 2, any accepted offer will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means that the later a deal is agreed upon, the less the value is.\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get nothing.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Value of accepting the current offer:** I would get 0 units of each item.  My total value would be: (0 * 66) + (0 * 79) + (0 * 12) + (0 * 81) + (0 * 35) = 0.  With the discount factor, this would still be 0 * 0.9 = 0.\n*   **Value of potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate my value based on the items I would keep. A counteroffer of [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5] would mean that I keep [3-x1, 2-x2, 5-x3, 7-x4, 5-x5] of each item.\n    *   Let's calculate the value of keeping everything, my maximum total value from the items: (3 * 66) + (2 * 79) + (5 * 12) + (7 * 81) + (5 * 35) = 198 + 158 + 60 + 567 + 175 = 1158. \n    *   This means I must always make sure any counteroffer keeps me above my outside option of 455. If I am making a counteroffer, I want to have value * 0.9 > 455, meaning I must keep items that total more than 505.5.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**  The current offer of 0 is much lower than my outside offer of 455.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is not an option, as 0 is lower than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away is always an option, but I am in round 2, and a counteroffer may still be profitable if I can get above 505.5.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer that ensures I receive more than 505.5 of value after the discount.\n\nGiven that I need to keep value above 505.5 (455/0.9), I must offer a deal that still gives me a large portion of the total item value. Let's consider making an offer that keeps most of the valuable items for myself. A counteroffer of [1, 0, 1, 2, 1] would give me (2 * 66) + (2 * 79) + (4 * 12) + (5 * 81) + (4 * 35) = 132 + 158 + 48 + 405 + 140 = 883, which multiplied by 0.9 gives me 794.7, meaning this deal would be better than walking away.\n\nHowever, the offer history shows I already offered [1,0,1,2,1]. I can't offer worse than that, but I could offer an equivalent deal. Offering an equivalent deal in this round when I need to ensure I get a deal above my outside offer is probably a good idea, and I will keep the same offer from the previous round.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

Giving away more than half of the items could lead to making an offer worth less than our outside offer, especially since Player 1 has a lower value for item 4, so a large offer in that direction might lead to them accepting, and leaving us with less. Making an offer worse than our previous offer or offering nothing is also a mistake. Since the last offer I gave was 0 items, giving anything less than the current offer from player 1 could be a problem, as that's what I offered last time.\n    \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The value of accepting the current offer, 877.5, is significantly greater than the outside offer value of 395.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer, adjusted by the discount rate, yields a value of 877.5 which is much higher than my outside offer of 395. \n*   Since it's only round 2, it's worthwhile to attempt to get a better deal for myself. I don't want to make an offer that's worse than the current one (mistake 1) or worse than my outside offer (mistake 2). I also don't want to offer nothing, as that was my previous offer (mistake 3).

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 455. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 819 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 2, 0].  This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 7 - 2 = 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 0 = 5 units\n\n    My value for this offer before discounting is:\n    (2 * 66) + (2 * 79) + (4 * 12) + (5 * 81) + (5 * 35) = 132 + 158 + 48 + 405 + 175 = 918.\n    My value after discounting = 918 * 0.81 = 743.58\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I will consider a few options, but first I need to consider if it is worth doing a counteroffer.  The current offer is already very good, and we are in the last round.  If I make a counteroffer now, Player 2 will walk.  Since the discounted value of the current offer is 743.58, and that is better than my outside offer of 455, it is better for me to accept.\n*  **Comparison to outside offer:** The value of the current offer is 743.58, which is much greater than my outside offer of 455.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\nSince the current offer provides a value (743.58) much better than my outside offer of 455 and we are in the final round, I should ACCEPT. Making a counteroffer would lead to a walk as Player 2 will not make a further offer in the last round, resulting in me getting my outside offer which is worse.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This value is less than my outside offer of 692.\n    *   I will now calculate my value if I propose a counteroffer of [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n    *   My value if I give [0, 0, 3, 0, 0] to Player 1 would be:\n        (3 * 38) + (4 * 52) + (2 * 13) + (5 * 86) + (3 * 6) = 114 + 208 + 26 + 430 + 18 = 796\n    *   My remaining value would be:\n         (0 * 38) + (0 * 52) + (3 * 13) + (0 * 86) + (0 * 6) = 39\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer (287) is much worse than my outside offer (692) and my potential counteroffer. Thus, accepting the current offer is not optimal.\n*   Walking away is an option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.\n*   I should make a counteroffer to try and achieve a better division.

This means I would keep the following:\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n    My value of accepting the current offer is then:\n    *   (3 * 86) + (4 * 84) + (2 * 33) + (5 * 51) + (3 * 54) = 258 + 336 + 66 + 255 + 162 = 1077.\n    *   Discounted value = 1077 * 0.9 = 969.3\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider various options.

This corresponds to giving away the most I can of the item I value the least. \n        *   My kept items: 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n        *   My value: (3*86) + (4*84) + (1*33) + (5*51) + (3*54) = 258 + 336 + 33 + 255 + 162 = 1044\n         *  Discounted value = 1044 * 0.9 = 939.6\n*  **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer is 969.3 which is way better than my outside offer of 480.  \n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n* The current offer of [0, 0, 3, 0, 0] has a value of 969.3 when discounted, which is far better than my outside offer of 480.\n* Based on this, I should accept the offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 785\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 51\n    *   Item 2: 80\n    *   Item 3: 70\n    *   Item 4: 85\n    *   Item 5: 15\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal made in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the deal, and in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value of the deal.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units  -> 2 * 51 = 102\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit  -> 1 * 80 = 80\n    *   Item 3: 2 units  -> 2 * 70 = 140\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit  -> 1 * 85 = 85\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit  -> 1 * 15 = 15\n    *   Total value of current offer: 102 + 80 + 140 + 85 + 15 = 422\n\n    The value of this offer is 422, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 785. It is also a very unfavorable offer overall.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to make a counteroffer that is better for me than 785. Since it's round 1, there is no need to be too conservative. Let me consider a counteroffer that gives me a good share of items but not all of them to avoid mistake 3 (offering no items or all items).\n    Let's aim to secure at least a value higher than my outside offer. Suppose I counteroffer giving Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 0], which means keeping for myself [3, 2, 4, 3, 3]. This calculates to:\n    *   Item 1: 3 units -> 3 * 51 = 153\n    *   Item 2: 2 units -> 2 * 80 = 160\n    *   Item 3: 4 units -> 4 * 70 = 280\n    *   Item 4: 3 units -> 3 * 85 = 255\n    *   Item 5: 3 units -> 3 * 15 = 45\n    *   Total value of my counteroffer = 893. This is better than my outside offer.\n\n    If the negotiation goes into round 2, and given the gamma=0.9, I would need to secure an agreement worth at least 785 / 0.9 = 872.2.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of 422 is much worse than my outside offer of 785. I should not accept it (avoiding mistake 4).\n*   I should definitely not walk away, as I can potentially get a better outcome with a counteroffer.\n*   My chosen counteroffer [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] which yields 893 is better than my outside offer (avoiding mistake 2). It is also not worse than the previous offer. (avoiding mistake 1)\n*   It's not offering everything or nothing either, so it isn't mistake 3\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 404\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 77\n    *   Item 2: 14\n    *   Item 3: 8\n    *   Item 4: 46\n    *   Item 5: 84\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 5\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 6\n    *   Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means any deal in future rounds is worth less to us today because of the discount.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 3\n\n    My value from this offer is:\n    (5 * 77) + (2 * 14) + (5 * 8) + (5 * 46) + (3 * 84) = 385 + 28 + 40 + 230 + 252 = 935. This is greater than my outside offer, so accepting is better than walking away *right now*.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to think strategically here.  I could try to get as close as possible to the full item value, but might be refused.  Let's consider if offering the other player the minimal items necessary to get more for myself would be better than this current offer.\n\n    - If I offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  to player 1, I would keep the full item value of 981, which is larger than the current offer of 935, so this would be a good offer for me.\n    - If I offered player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], I keep:\n        - Item 1: 4 * 77 = 308\n        - Item 2: 1 * 14 = 14\n        - Item 3: 4 * 8 = 32\n        - Item 4: 5 * 46 = 230\n        - Item 5: 2 * 84 = 168\n    Total value is 752, which is worse than 935.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 935, which is greater than my outside offer of 404.  Counter-offering 0 of each item gives me 981, which is larger than the current offer of 935.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 935, better than my outside offer of 404, so I should not walk. However, I think it's better to counteroffer, and I can afford to be somewhat aggressive at the start of the negotiations. Since it is round 1, the discount factor does not play any role in calculations yet.\n\nI will make a counteroffer giving player 1 as little as possible.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This means I receive all the items.  The total value of all items is:\n    (5 * 1) + (2 * 42) + (5 * 67) + (6 * 29) + (3 * 92) = 5 + 84 + 335 + 174 + 276 = 874.\n    My discounted value of accepting this offer now is 874 * 0.9 = 786.6\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few potential counteroffers and their values, keeping in mind that we should not make an offer worse than our current situation. We have no info on player 2's value of the items, and they offered us nothing so far, so it is unlikely they will take much. For now, it makes sense to give them a small amount of the items we don't value as much, and see what happens. Let's consider offering [1, 0, 1, 2, 0] to Player 2:\n    My remaining items are [4, 2, 4, 4, 3].\n    My value: (4 * 1) + (2 * 42) + (4 * 67) + (4 * 29) + (3 * 92) = 4 + 84 + 268 + 116 + 276 = 748.\n   Discounted at this round: 748 * 0.9 = 673.2.

This is still less than my outside offer\n           Let's consider offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 2 and keep everything:\n           My value: 874\n           Discounted value: 874 * 0.9 = 786.6\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer gives me a discounted value of 786.6 which is lower than my outside offer 838, but accepting that would be mistake 4, and giving a counteroffer would be mistake 1 (worse than our last offer which was everything). However, walking away is also not optimal.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer would give me a discounted value of 786.6, which is below my outside offer 838.\n*   Making a counteroffer at all would be a worse offer than the current one, since the current offer is everything. We must not make a worse offer.\n*   Accepting this would be mistake 4.\n*   Walking away would be mistake 5 (since we have a value higher than the outside offer)\n*  Since it seems likely Player 2 may take this, and we are in round 2, it seems optimal to offer them a tiny amount less of a valued good, in the hopes we can get to the end of the game and have an offer that's closer to our outside offer.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

I'll start by offering them 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 to Player 2.\n\nThat means I would keep: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nMy value for this would be:\n    * 3 * 16 = 48\n    * 3 * 39 = 117\n    * 2 * 60 = 120\n    * 2 * 24 = 48\n    * 3 * 37 = 111\n    * Total value = 48 + 117 + 120 + 48 + 111 = 444\n\n This is greater than my outside offer value, so this is a viable offer.\n    \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nI will propose a counteroffer where I give the following to player 2:\n    * 2 units of item 1\n    * 3 units of item 2\n    * 2 units of item 3\n    * 2 units of item 4\n    * 2 units of item 5\n    \nThis results in me keeping:\n    * 3 units of item 1\n    * 3 units of item 2\n    * 2 units of item 3\n    * 2 units of item 4\n    * 3 units of item 5\n\nI will now make my offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 2, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

Since our current value from the offer is less than our outside offer, we should definitely consider a counteroffer. \n\n    Let's start by considering what it would look like if we keep all the items for ourselves, as a benchmark:\n        (5 * 28) + (3 * 52) + (4 * 32) + (6 * 92) + (1 * 37) = 140 + 156 + 128 + 552 + 37 = 1013\n\n    Given that the total potential value is 1013, let's consider giving away 1 unit of items 1 through 4 (keeping item 5).

This is not a good counteroffer since it's still less than my outside value.\n    \n    Let's try to only give away some item 4 to Player 1 and keep everything else. Let's consider an offer like this: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n     This gives me:\n     (5 * 28) + (3 * 52) + (4 * 32) + (5 * 92) + (1 * 37) =  140 + 156 + 128 + 460 + 37 = 921.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 595\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 35, Item 2: 86, Item 3: 45, Item 4: 51, Item 5: 74\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we're in round 2, the discount factor will be applied as 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] which means I would get 0 item 1, 0 item 2, 0 item 3, 1 item 4, 0 item 5. This corresponds to the other agent getting [5, 3, 4, 5, 1].\n    My value of the current offer: 0 * 35 + 0 * 86 + 0 * 45 + 1 * 51 + 0 * 74 = 51.\n    My discounted value of the current offer: 51 * 0.9 = 45.9\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My current offer (45.9) is much less than my outside offer (595).\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I will consider offering a split that leaves me with more value. Since my value for item 2 is very high, I'll want to secure some of that. A good starting point might be to offer player 2 half of the items (rounded as needed).\n\n    Let's evaluate a counteroffer where I give player 2 the following: [2, 1, 2, 3, 0]. This would mean I would receive: [3, 2, 2, 3, 1].\n    My value for this counteroffer is (3 * 35) + (2 * 86) + (2 * 45) + (3 * 51) + (1 * 74) = 105 + 172 + 90 + 153 + 74 = 594\n    Discounted value: 594*0.9 = 534.6\n    \n    Let's evaluate a more aggressive counteroffer where I give player 2 [0,0,0,1,0]. My value here would be (5 * 35) + (3 * 86) + (4 * 45) + (5 * 51) + (1 * 74) = 175 + 258 + 180 + 255 + 74 = 942\n    Discounted Value 942 * 0.9 = 847.8\n\n    Another option, I offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] to Player 2.\n    This would mean I get [4, 2, 3, 5, 1].\n    My value: 140 + 172 + 135 + 255 + 74 = 776\n    Discounted Value: 776 * 0.9 = 698.4\n    This is higher than my outside offer, which is better.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is very bad for me.\n*   Walking away is also bad because there are potential deals I can make which provide more value than my outside option.\n*   Offering [2, 1, 2, 3, 0] is decent but I could make a better counteroffer.\n*   I should make an offer which is not equal or worse than the outside option, and better than my last offer. Let's offer [1,1,1,1,0]\n*   This offer has a discounted value of 698.4\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

Since we are in round 2, any deal will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer on the table is [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]. This means Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer is: (1 * 28) + (1 * 52) + (1 * 32) + (1 * 92) + (0 * 37) = 204\n    *   Adjusted value (taking into account the discount factor for round 2): 204 * 0.9 = 183.6\n    *   Therefore, accepting the current offer yields a total value of 183.6, which is less than my outside offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what values I can obtain from a counteroffer, factoring in that the negotiation only has one more round remaining.\n    *   If I keep all items, my value would be (5 * 28) + (3 * 52) + (4 * 32) + (6 * 92) + (1 * 37) = 1013. Discounted to 0.9*1013 = 911.7.\n    *   Since my outside offer is 889, I should not accept less than that on this round. If I cannot get an offer for at least 889 discounted by 0.9 (i.e. at least 889 / 0.9 = 987.78), then I should walk away.\n    * Let's see what offer I would need to make to just get 987.78 with the remaining items\n    * The items I have to work with are item 1, item 2, item 3, item 4 and item 5 and my values for them are 28, 52, 32, 92 and 37, and there are 5, 3, 4, 6 and 1 of each.\n    * If I wanted to get to 987.78 exactly, and I must give at least some to player 1, I can see if I can hit the mark by giving away only item 1, item 2 and item 3, and keeping item 4 and item 5.\n    * Item 4 and Item 5 are worth 6 * 92 + 1 * 37 = 589, and if I keep 5 of Item 1, 3 of Item 2 and 4 of item 3, that would be worth 140+156+128 = 424 for a total of 1013, which is over the threshold. If I give away only 1 item, Item 4, my value would still be 1013 - 92 = 921 < 987. So I must give more.\n    * Let's see if it is optimal to offer 0 of item 4 and 0 of item 5 and then work from there.\n    * My value if I kept all items of type 1, 2, and 3: is (5 * 28) + (3 * 52) + (4 * 32) = 140 + 156 + 128 = 424.\n    * My value if I gave away all items of type 1, 2 and 3: is 589. If I give them 1 of item 1, it is (4 * 28) + 156 + 128 = 408. If I gave them 2 it would be 380. 3:352, 4: 324, 5:296\n    * So an offer of [2, 2, 2, 0, 0] is probably the best we can do here (I will keep 3 units of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 6 of item 4 and 1 of item 5) which gives us (3 * 28) + (1 * 52) + (2 * 32) + (6*92) + (1*37) = 84+52+64+552+37=789 which discounted by 0.9 is 710, which is below my outside offer, so I cannot accept it.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (adjusted value 183.6) is much less than my outside offer of 889. Any offer that is below 889/0.9 = 987.77 would also be inferior to my outside offer if accepted, making a walk away the only option.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is not optimal because it is much worse than my outside offer.\n*   Making a counteroffer is not optimal either, because given the remaining items, I cannot make an offer that gives me more than my outside offer at a discount of 0.9 for this round.\n*   Therefore, the best action is to walk away and take my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

I should not offer nothing or everything, as this is a mistake. I need to propose something that leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer, 214. My total value from all items is 429.\n    *   If I keep all of item 3, it has a value of 4 * 75 = 300. I should try to retain as much of item 3 as possible.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1050. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1161 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    \n    Value of current offer to me:\n    *   3 * 89 (item 1) = 267\n    *   2 * 92 (item 2) = 184\n    *   3 * 79 (item 3) = 237\n    *   3 * 77 (item 4) = 231\n    *   2 * 50 (item 5) = 100\n    \n    Total value if I accept current offer: 267 + 184 + 237 + 231 + 100 = 1019.\n    \n    My outside offer is 1050. \n   \n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** It is not possible to do exhaustive calculations here, but I want to determine a counteroffer that's better than the current offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1050\n*   **My item values:** 89 (item 1), 92 (item 2), 79 (item 3), 77 (item 4), 50 (item 5)\n*   **Total pool of items:** 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 2, if a deal is reached now, the value is multiplied by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9. If we reach a deal next round the value will be multiplied by gamma^2 = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n     * Value: (4 * 89) + (2 * 92) + (4 * 79) + (2 * 77) + (2 * 50) = 356 + 184 + 316 + 154 + 100 = 1110\n    *   The discounted value for accepting the current offer is 1110 * 0.9 = 999.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to think of an offer that would be better than my outside offer after the discount and better than 999 (the discounted value of the current offer), while being something player 1 could accept. Let's examine a simple counteroffer, giving 1 unit of everything, keeping more of what I value more (items 1, 2, 3): giving [1,1,1,1,1]:\n    * My value: (3 * 89) + (1 * 92) + (3 * 79) + (2 * 77) + (1 * 50) = 267 + 92 + 237 + 154 + 50= 800\n    * Discounted value: 800 * 0.9 = 720\n    This is below my outside offer. Let me try something where I take more. Let's try giving Player 1 only the single unit of item 4 they're currently offering:\n    * Offer: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n    * My value: (4 * 89) + (2 * 92) + (4 * 79) + (2 * 77) + (2 * 50) = 356 + 184 + 316 + 154 + 100 = 1110\n    * Discounted value: 1110 * 0.9 = 999.  This is still not higher than my outside offer. Let's give up less.\n* Let's give [1,0,1,0,1]\n    * My value: (3*89) + (2*92) + (3*79) + (3*77) + (1*50) = 267 + 184 + 237 + 231 + 50 = 969\n    * Discounted value: 969*0.9 = 872.1\n    * Let's look at giving [0,0,0,0,0]:\n    * My value: (4 * 89) + (2 * 92) + (4 * 79) + (3 * 77) + (2 * 50) = 356 + 184 + 316 + 231 + 100 = 1187.\n    * Discounted Value: 1187 * 0.9 = 1068.3.  This is higher than the outside offer. This is not an offer, but my outside value after the discount.\n    * Let's give [0,0,0,0,0]. This is equivalent to not offering anything to player 1. This is a mistake. Let's try [1,0,1,1,0]:\n    * My value: 267 + 184 + 237 + 154 + 100 = 942\n    * Discounted Value: 942*.9= 847.8\n     * How do these values compare to my outside offer value?  The current offer is worse than my outside offer (999 < 1050).\n        \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 999 to me, which is less than my outside offer of 1050.\n*   If I walk, I get 1050.\n*   If I counteroffer [0,0,0,0,0] I will end up walking on the next round, so this is not really a counter offer. I am also not really meant to offer nothing on the second round (mistake 3).\n*   I should counteroffer with something better than my outside offer for me, after the discount, but something that player 1 might take.\n*   The counteroffer I should make is [0,0,0,0,0] is treated as a walk, so this is incorrect.\n*   I will offer player 1 [1,0,1,1,0].\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

Here's a proposal and its calculation:\n    *   Offer to Player 2:\n        *   Item 1: 2 units\n        *   Item 2: 1 unit\n        *   Item 3: 1 unit\n        *   Item 4: 2 units\n        *   Item 5: 3 units\n    *   My remaining items:\n        *   Item 1: 2 units\n        *   Item 2: 0 unit\n        *   Item 3: 1 unit\n        *   Item 4: 2 units\n        *   Item 5: 3 units\n    *   My value for this offer:\n        *   Item 1: 2 * 94 = 188\n        *   Item 2: 0 * 68 = 0\n        *   Item 3: 1 * 96 = 96\n        *   Item 4: 2 * 17 = 34\n        *   Item 5: 3 * 74 = 222\n        *   Total Value: 188 + 0 + 96 + 34 + 222 = 540\n\n   *  This value (540) is greater than my outside offer of 473, so it's a valid offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n   Since I need to make an offer in the first round I will make the offer calculated above. I will not accept a non-existent offer, nor will I walk.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 3]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on my action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 207.\n*   **Item values:** My values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 39\n    *   Item 2: 56\n    *   Item 3: 33\n    *   Item 4: 43\n    *   Item 5: 81\n*   **Total items:** There are 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer earlier. Specifically, accepting in round 2 gives me 0.9 times my value and accepting in round 3 gives me 0.81 times my value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 1, 2, 3]. This means I get:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 39 = 78\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 56 = 56\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 33 = 33\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 43 = 86\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 81 = 243\n    *   Total value of current offer: 78 + 56 + 33 + 86 + 243 = 496\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (496) is much higher than my outside offer (207). It is worth considering a counter offer, though, since I'm giving up a lot of value by keeping only what is offered.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's calculate the total value of keeping more of the items by offering the other player 2 units of each item.\n    * Item 1: 2 units left * 39 = 78\n    * Item 2: 0 units left * 56 = 0\n    * Item 3: 0 units left * 33 = 0\n    * Item 4: 2 units left * 43 = 86\n    * Item 5: 3 units left * 81 = 243\n    *Total value of keeping the remaining items: 78 + 0 + 0 + 86 + 243= 407.\n\n    Let's calculate the total value of keeping as much as possible, by offering the other player 0 units of items 1, 2 and 3 and 1 unit of items 4 and 5.\n    *   Item 1: 4 units * 39 = 156\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit * 56 = 56\n    *   Item 3: 2 units * 33 = 66\n    *   Item 4: 3 units * 43 = 129\n    *   Item 5: 5 units * 81 = 405\n     *   Total Value: 156 + 56 + 66 + 129 + 405 = 812\n\n    Now lets try a counter offer to player 1 of 1 unit of each of the five item types\n    *   Item 1: 3 units * 39 = 117\n    *   Item 2: 0 units * 56 = 0\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit * 33 = 33\n    *   Item 4: 3 units * 43 = 129\n    *   Item 5: 5 units * 81 = 405\n    *   Total Value: 117 + 0 + 33 + 129 + 405 = 684\n    \n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is very good, giving a total value of 496. However, it's only round 1, and it's very likely that Player 1 is making a similar calculation (that is, they are offering me less than half of the items to see if I accept it, or if I am willing to negotiate). \n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer offering player 1 1 unit of each item to test the waters.  My total value would be 684 if they accepted this counter offer. This keeps me above my outside offer of 207, and the counteroffer is still likely profitable for Player 1.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Since we are in round 2, the discount factor for this round is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 1 = 0\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 6 - 1 = 5\n    My value from this would be: (3 * 94) + (0 * 68) + (1 * 96) + (3 * 17) + (5 * 74) = 282 + 0 + 96 + 51 + 370 = 799. Applying the discount factor of 0.9, this becomes 799 * 0.9 = 719.1\n*  **Previous offer:** Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 3] which means you would have gotten the following:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 1 = 0\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 6 - 3 = 3\n    My value from this offer (had it been accepted) would have been: (2 * 94) + (0 * 68) + (1 * 96) + (2 * 17) + (3 * 74) = 188 + 0 + 96 + 34 + 222 = 540.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   Let's consider a counteroffer that aims for roughly an even split while leaning towards more of the items I value more. I could propose offering Player 2 [2, 0, 1, 2, 2], keeping [2, 1, 1, 2, 4]. My value is (2*94) + (1*68) + (1*96) + (2*17) + (4*74) = 188 + 68 + 96 + 34 + 296 = 682.  Applying the discount factor of 0.9, this becomes 682 * 0.9 = 613.8\n    *  As another option, I could try to get the majority of valuable items and offer Player 2 [1, 0, 0, 1, 1], keeping [3, 1, 2, 3, 5]. My value from this would be (3*94) + (1*68) + (2*96) + (3*17) + (5*74) = 282 + 68 + 192 + 51 + 370 = 963. Applying discount factor, this becomes 963*0.9=866.7\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 719.1, which is significantly more than my outside offer of 473. The first counteroffer is worth 613.8, and the second is worth 866.7, which are both higher than 473.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is worth 719.1, which is a very good deal as it is greater than the outside offer.\n*   Walking away would only give me 473 which is less than current offer.\n*  Making the counteroffer of [2, 0, 1, 2, 2] gives me 613.8 which is lower than current offer, so would be a mistake to make it.\n*  Making the counteroffer of [1,0,0,1,1] gives me 866.7.\n\nGiven that the current offer is pretty good and I could get a slightly better deal by counteroffering [1,0,0,1,1], I will propose the counteroffer of [1,0,0,1,1]. This is better than walking away, and better than the current offer, assuming Player 2 does not walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 207\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 39\n    *   Item 2: 56\n    *   Item 3: 33\n    *   Item 4: 43\n    *   Item 5: 81\n*   **Total item pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] which means I get 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    My value for this offer is: (1 * 39) + (0 * 56) + (0 * 33) + (1 * 43) + (1 * 81) = 39 + 0 + 0 + 43 + 81 = 163\n    Considering the discount factor, the value of accepting now is 163 * 0.9 = 146.7\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   I need to make a counter offer that is more beneficial than the 146.7 I would get from accepting the current offer and also better than the 207 outside offer.\n    *   I have a total of (4-1)=3 units of item 1 left, (1-0)=1 unit of item 2, (2-0)=2 units of item 3, (4-1)=3 units of item 4, and (6-1)=5 units of item 5 left for my benefit.\n    *   Let's assess a few potential counter offers:\n      *   Offer: [1,0,1,1,1] which is a bit more generous than player 1's offer: I would receive 3 * 39 + 1 * 56 + 1 * 33 + 3 * 43 + 5 * 81 = 117 + 56 + 33 + 129 + 405 = 740 discounted by 0.9 = 666.\n      *   Offer: [2,0,1,2,2] I would receive 2*39 + 1*56 + 1*33 + 2*43+4*81 = 78 + 56 + 33 + 86 + 324 = 577. discounted by 0.9 = 519.3.\n    *   I will not make a counter offer worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The value of accepting the current offer is 146.7, which is less than my outside offer of 207.\n    *   My first potential counter offer had a discounted value of 666 and my second had a discounted value of 519.3. Both are better than my outside offer and both are better than accepting the current offer.\n    * It seems like proposing a more favorable offer is the best course of action.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is not beneficial. It would give me a discounted value of 146.7, which is worse than my outside offer of 207. This would be mistake #4.\n*   Walking away would give me 207, but there is potential to receive much more in the negotiation.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer. Let's go with the more generous offer that gives me a higher total value, [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This offer gives player 1 only 1 unit of item 1, and 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5, and no units of item 2, leaving me with 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5. This would yield me a discounted value of 666, which is much more preferable than my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 860\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 26\n    *   Item 2: 76\n    *   Item 3: 15\n    *   Item 4: 54\n    *   Item 5: 17\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6\n    *   Item 2: 6\n    *   Item 3: 9\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 1\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that any outcome in future rounds is worth less than an outcome in the current round. Specifically, in round 2, a deal will be worth 0.9 times less, and in round 3, a deal will be worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times less.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 3, 4, 2, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   Item 1: 3 units * 26 = 78\n    *   Item 2: 3 units * 76 = 228\n    *   Item 3: 4 units * 15 = 60\n    *   Item 4: 2 units * 54 = 108\n    *   Item 5: 0 units * 17 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer = 78 + 228 + 60 + 108 + 0 = 474\n\n*   **Comparing to my outside offer:** The value of the current offer (474) is *less* than my outside offer (860).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would get in the future if I make a counteroffer. The discount factor will affect that, so I need to make an offer that would leave me better off than just accepting my outside offer, taking into consideration that I could get the same value next turn, but discounted. \n    I should aim for a value greater than 860 / 0.9 = 955.5 if the negotiation continues to round 2, or 860 / 0.81 = 1061.7 if it continues to round 3.\n     Let's try to make a counteroffer that gives me a value over my outside option.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 474, which is much worse than my outside offer of 860. Therefore, accepting is not an option. I need to counteroffer.\n\nI want to aim for a value of at least 860 this round, or higher than that given the discount. Let's try offering player 1 what I perceive to be a roughly fair share initially: offer player 1 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n\n* This would give me 4 of item 1 (104), 4 of item 2 (304), 6 of item 3 (90), 4 of item 4 (216), and 1 of item 5 (17). This totals 731. This is still not enough to make me value the offer over my outside option (860), even in round one.\nLet's increase the items I keep.\nLet's try offering player 1 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n\n* This would give me 5 of item 1 (130), 5 of item 2 (380), 7 of item 3 (105), 4 of item 4 (216), and 1 of item 5 (17). This totals 848. Still not quite enough.\n\nLet's aim to keep more of items 2 and 4 which I value highly, and see what offer will benefit me more than 860.\nLet's try offering player 1 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n\n* This would give me 6 of item 1 (156), 5 of item 2 (380), 7 of item 3 (105), 5 of item 4 (270), and 1 of item 5 (17). This totals 928, which is greater than my outside offer and greater than 860/0.9 if negotiation continues.\n\n**Final Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Since this is round 2, any deal reached will be multiplied by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 1, 2, 0, 0] (I get 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 0 of item 5)\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer value:**\n    *   Item 1: 0 * 5 = 0\n    *   Item 2: 1 * 56 = 56\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 48 = 96\n    *   Item 4: 0 * 52 = 0\n    *   Item 5: 0 * 28 = 0\n    *   Total Value: 0 + 56 + 96 + 0 + 0 = 152\n    *   Discounted value = 152 * 0.9 = 136.8\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is worth 1.

I also know that this is round 2, meaning we're already closer to the end, so I will try to make a strong offer to bring this deal to a close.\n\nLet's calculate the value of the original round 1 offer (to me): \n*   Player 1 offered [3, 3, 4, 2, 0], this means that Player 1 was keeping [3,3,5,3,1]\n    * Item 1: 3 * 5 = 15\n    * Item 2: 3 * 56 = 168\n    * Item 3: 5 * 48 = 240\n    * Item 4: 3 * 52 = 156\n    * Item 5: 1 * 28 = 28\n    * Total Value = 607.0\n    * Discounted total value = 607 * 0.9 = 546.3\n\nBecause I only have two rounds left, it would be worth it for me to try and get a value at least as high as the original offer from round 1. I also want to avoid making a counteroffer that offers nothing to my opponent, so let's try to offer the other player a reasonable amount of items whilst also keeping enough for myself to make the deal worthwhile.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 860\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 26, Item 2: 76, Item 3: 15, Item 4: 54, Item 5: 17\n*   **Total pool of items:** 6 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal reached in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the face value of the items, and a deal reached in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 times the face value of the items.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 2, 1, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 26 = 26\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 76 = 76\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 15 = 30\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 54 = 54\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 17 = 0\n    *   **Total value of current offer:** 26 + 76 + 30 + 54 + 0 = 186\n    *   Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 186 * 0.9^(2-1) = 186 * 0.9 = 167.4. This value of 167.4 is significantly worse than my outside offer of 860.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me more than 860 (discounted by 0.9), which is worth more than 860 /0.9 = 955.56. My total possible value is 6*26 + 6*76 + 9*15 + 5*54 + 1*17 = 156 + 456 + 135 + 270 + 17 = 1034. Therefore, we know it's possible to achieve a value greater than 955.56 if we were to retain the right items. \n\n    * Let's consider offering player 1 [2, 2, 3, 1, 0]. If I keep the rest this means I would get [4, 4, 6, 4, 1]. \n        * 4*26 + 4*76 + 6*15 + 4*54 + 1*17 = 104 + 304 + 90 + 216 + 17 = 731. This is not good enough.\n    * Let's consider offering player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. If I keep the rest this means I would get [5, 6, 8, 5, 1].\n        * 5*26 + 6*76 + 8*15 + 5*54 + 1*17 = 130 + 456 + 120 + 270 + 17 = 993. This is better, and now that is greater than 955.56\n     * Let's consider offering player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. If I keep the rest this means I would get [6, 6, 9, 5, 1].\n        * 6*26 + 6*76 + 9*15 + 5*54 + 1*17 = 156 + 456 + 135 + 270 + 17 = 1034. This is our best possible value. This makes sense, keeping everything gives us our total possible value.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (167.4) is much worse than my outside offer (860).\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible, so I should not accept it.\n*   It is Round 2, so I still have a chance to get more value.\n*   A counteroffer that gives me at least 956 (before discount) or at least 860 (after discount in round 2) will be better than walking away.\n*   As seen above, offering [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] to Player 1 results in a value of 993 for me, which is greater than the 955.56 required before the discount factor is applied, which would result in a value for me of 893.7. This is better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This means accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less. Round 1 has no discount.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   1 unit of Item 1: 1 * 23 = 23\n    *   1 unit of Item 2: 1 * 74 = 74\n    *   0 units of Item 3: 0 * 18 = 0\n    *   1 unit of Item 4: 1 * 36 = 36\n    *   0 unit of Item 5: 0 * 58 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 23 + 74 + 0 + 36 + 0 = 133. This is better than my outside offer of 18.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer that tries to secure more items with high value for me:\n    *   I could propose giving Player 1 half of the available items for Item 1, 2, 4 and 5 and see if they accept: [2, 2, 0, 2, 1]. This would leave me with:\n        * 2 units of Item 1: 2 * 23 = 46\n        * 2 units of Item 2: 2 * 74 = 148\n        * 1 unit of Item 3: 1 * 18 = 18\n        * 3 units of Item 4: 3 * 36 = 108\n        * 1 unit of Item 5: 1 * 58 = 58\n        * Total value for me: 46+148+18+108+58=378. This is still better than 18. \n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 133, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 18.\n*   However, I can potentially get a better deal with a counteroffer that doesn't give away items that I value highly.\n*   I will propose the counteroffer of [2,2,0,2,1], keeping valuable items for myself without giving away everything.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

Since it is round 2, it is probably better to attempt to get a better offer for myself by making a counteroffer. I will look at some potential counter offers.  I know that offering no items or all items is suboptimal.\n\n    Let's examine an offer that gives me more of the items that are worth more to me. The current offer gives me 2 of each of the first 2 items, so maybe offering to give back one unit of each of these could get me more of the others. Let's consider a counteroffer of [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This would give me:\n    *   Item 1: 3 * 38 = 114\n    *   Item 2: 3 * 89 = 267\n    *   Item 3: 1 * 47 = 47\n    *   Item 4: 4 * 28 = 112\n    *   Item 5: 2 * 35 = 70\n    *   Total: 114 + 267 + 47 + 112 + 70 = 610. This is great, but this is a value BEFORE discount rate.  Discounted value is 610 * 0.9 = 549. This is much better than my current offer and my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nThe current offer has a discounted value of 378. My outside offer value is 348. The counteroffer of [1, 1, 0, 1, 0] has a discounted value of 549. I will therefore offer [1, 1, 0, 1, 0] as a counter offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

This means I would receive:\n    *   3 units of item 1 = 3 * 23 = 69\n    *   3 units of item 2 = 3 * 74 = 222\n    *   1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 18 = 18\n    *   4 units of item 4 = 4 * 36 = 144\n    *   2 units of item 5 = 2 * 58 = 116\n    *  Total value = 69 + 222 + 18 + 144 + 116 = 569.\n    *  Adjusting for the discount factor 569 * 0.9 = 512.1\n*   **Counteroffers:**\n    *   I need to consider whether any counteroffer is better than accepting this deal. Since this is round 2, a counteroffer will result in a walk in the last round, yielding my outside offer. So, if there's a counteroffer that gives me more than 18 at round 3, it would not be good as I would get my outside value instead of that value, but in this case, I'm comparing to a discounted value of an existing offer.\n    *   My total value if I keep all items is: 4 * 23 + 4 * 74 + 1 * 18 + 5 * 36 + 2 * 58 = 92 + 296 + 18 + 180 + 116 = 702\n*  **Comparison:** The discounted value of the current offer 512.1 is significantly better than my outside offer of 18.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer gives me 512.1, which is much better than my outside offer of 18.\n*   Any counteroffer will result in me receiving my outside offer in the next round, which is far less than 512.1\n*   Therefore, I should ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 745. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 687 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action for Player 1 in this first round.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is 745. This is my guaranteed fallback value, and any deal I accept must be worth at least this much.\n*   **Item Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 50 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 61 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 70 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 36 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 12 per unit\n*   **Total Items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 6 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. Since this is round 1, the discount factor's impact is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1. This means there is no initial discount on current values.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    *   To avoid making mistakes, I need to ensure that I don't offer myself less value than my outside offer.\n    *   I could potentially start with a proposal that is more skewed in my favor and allow for some compromise in later rounds, if necessary. However, I also want a realistic offer in order not to seem completely unreasonable to Player 2, which might lead them to WALK early and cost me a potentially better value outcome.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\nSince there is no current offer on the table, I cannot accept anything. Nor will I walk away as this is the first round of negotiations. I will propose a counteroffer that is at least as good as my outside offer and also offer Player 2 a reasonable amount, so that they would find it preferable to WALK. I will propose to give them a little over half of the total value of the items.\nLet's calculate the total value of items I possess:\nItem 1: 4 * 50 = 200\nItem 2: 6 * 61 = 366\nItem 3: 2 * 70 = 140\nItem 4: 3 * 36 = 108\nItem 5: 5 * 12 = 60\nTotal Value: 200 + 366 + 140 + 108 + 60 = 874\nHalf of this is 437, so I want to ensure that I give Player 2 something more than 437 in value. I'll start with an offer that gives them a bit more than half and gives me a value that is still greater than 745.\nI will start with giving away 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\nMy remaining values:\nItem 1: (4-2) * 50 = 100\nItem 2: (6-3) * 61 = 183\nItem 3: (2-1) * 70 = 70\nItem 4: (3-1) * 36 = 72\nItem 5: (5-2) * 12 = 36\nTotal value to me: 100 + 183 + 70 + 72 + 36 = 461.\nThis is less than my outside offer of 745, so this won't do. I must provide myself at least that. \nI will propose to give Player 2: 1 of Item 1, 2 of Item 2, 0 of Item 3, 1 of Item 4, and 2 of Item 5. This leaves me with 3 of Item 1, 4 of Item 2, 2 of Item 3, 2 of Item 4, and 3 of Item 5.\nMy total value: 3*50 + 4*61 + 2*70 + 2*36 + 3*12 = 150 + 244 + 140 + 72 + 36 = 642. This is still less than my outside offer. I need to give Player 2 less.\nHow about I give Player 2: 1 of Item 1, 1 of Item 2, 0 of Item 3, 0 of Item 4, and 1 of Item 5. This leaves me with 3 of Item 1, 5 of Item 2, 2 of Item 3, 3 of Item 4, and 4 of Item 5.\nMy total value: 3*50 + 5*61 + 2*70 + 3*36 + 4*12 = 150 + 305 + 140 + 108 + 48 = 751. This is higher than my outside offer value.\nI'll make this the counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means any deal will have its value multiplied by 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me \\[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This means I keep:\n    * Item 1: 4-1 = 3\n    * Item 2: 6-0 = 6\n    * Item 3: 2-0 = 2\n    * Item 4: 3-1 = 2\n    * Item 5: 5-1 = 4\n    Value of current offer to me: (3 * 50) + (6 * 61) + (2 * 70) + (2 * 36) + (4 * 12) = 150 + 366 + 140 + 72 + 48 = 776\n    Discounted value = 776 * 0.9 = 698.4\n* **Compare to my outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 745. The discounted value of the current offer is 698.4 which is less than my outside offer.\n* **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate some potential counteroffers to determine what the best path is here. Let's try to target an equal split of goods between the players, and then adjust to make sure we're better off than our outside offer:\n    If I offer: \\[2, 3, 1, 1, 2] (an equal split, adjusted because there are uneven number of items).\n     I keep:\n       * Item 1: 4-2 = 2\n       * Item 2: 6-3 = 3\n       * Item 3: 2-1 = 1\n       * Item 4: 3-1 = 2\n       * Item 5: 5-2 = 3\n    Value of counteroffer to me: (2 * 50) + (3 * 61) + (1 * 70) + (2 * 36) + (3 * 12) = 100 + 183 + 70 + 72 + 36 = 461\n\nLet's try to offer a bit less. \n    If I offer: \\[1, 2, 0, 1, 1].\n     I keep:\n       * Item 1: 4-1 = 3\n       * Item 2: 6-2 = 4\n       * Item 3: 2-0 = 2\n       * Item 4: 3-1 = 2\n       * Item 5: 5-1 = 4\n    Value of counteroffer to me: (3 * 50) + (4 * 61) + (2 * 70) + (2 * 36) + (4 * 12) = 150 + 244 + 140 + 72 + 48 = 654\n    \n    If I offer: \\[1, 1, 0, 0, 1].\n     I keep:\n        * Item 1: 4-1 = 3\n        * Item 2: 6-1 = 5\n        * Item 3: 2-0 = 2\n        * Item 4: 3-0 = 3\n        * Item 5: 5-1 = 4\n     Value of counteroffer to me: (3 * 50) + (5 * 61) + (2 * 70) + (3 * 36) + (4 * 12) = 150 + 305 + 140 + 108 + 48 = 751\n    \n        \n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of 698.4 is less than my outside offer of 745, so I should not accept it.\n*   I can make a counteroffer. The offer of [1, 1, 0, 0, 1] provides me a total of 751. Since this is better than my outside offer, this seems to be a reasonable offer.\n*   Making an offer less than what the current offer gives me is a mistake because they are not getting better for me.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 406. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 52 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 54 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 12 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 26 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 85 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 9 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 6 units\n    *   Item 5: 0 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value of a deal in round 1. This incentivizes reaching an agreement earlier.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so this is irrelevant to my current decision.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since it's round 1 and I'm the first player, I need to propose an initial offer. I want to maximize my value, but also try to make an offer that's not immediately rejected. I also need to avoid making offer number 3, offering nothing or all items to the other player. Let me consider a few potential counteroffers. First, I will calculate the total value to me of the total pool of items.\n    * Total Value of all items = (1*52) + (9*54) + (3*12) + (6*26) + (0*85) = 52 + 486 + 36 + 156 + 0 = 730\n    I will consider an offer where I offer half of the total value to player 2. This would mean that I keep half for myself. Given that this is the first round I will keep slightly more than half for myself.\n\n    *  Offer of 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 to Player 2.\n       *   My value would then be : (1 * 52) + (5 * 54) + (2 * 12) + (4 * 26) + (0 * 85) = 52 + 270 + 24 + 104 + 0 = 450.\n       This is better than my outside offer.\n   * Offer of 0 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 to Player 2.\n       * My value would then be: (1 * 52) + (4 * 54) + (1 * 12) + (3 * 26) + (0 * 85) = 52 + 216 + 12 + 78 = 358\n       This is worse than my outside offer.\n\n    Let me consider another offer, giving 40% of the items' total value to Player 2. This roughly corresponds to giving them 0.4 of the available items\n    * Offer of 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 to Player 2.\n       * My value would then be : (1 * 52) + (6 * 54) + (2 * 12) + (4 * 26) + (0 * 85) = 52 + 324 + 24 + 104 = 504.\n       This is better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will make the counteroffer of 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 to Player 2. This gives me a total value of 504 which is greater than my outside offer value of 406. It is also an offer that has a reasonable chance of being accepted.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 2, 0]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 687. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 981 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 4, 1, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 687\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 67, Item 2: 47, Item 3: 77, Item 4: 71, Item 5: 65\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 1, Item 2: 9, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 6, Item 5: 0\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get:\n    * 0 units of Item 1: 0 * 67 = 0\n    * 3 units of Item 2: 3 * 47 = 141\n    * 0 units of Item 3: 0 * 77 = 0\n    * 0 units of Item 4: 0 * 71 = 0\n    * 0 units of Item 5: 0 * 65 = 0\n    * Total value of current offer: 141\n    * Discounted value of current offer: 141 * 0.9 = 126.9\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. I need to calculate some possibilities, keeping in mind I have to offer something to Player 1 to avoid a walk.\n    *   Consider giving Player 1 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would have [1, 7, 3, 6, 0]. My value would be:\n         * 1 * 67 + 7 * 47 + 3 * 77 + 6 * 71 + 0 * 65 = 67 + 329 + 231 + 426 + 0 = 1053\n         * Discounted value: 1053 * 0.9 = 947.7\n    * Consider offering [0, 3, 1, 2, 0] to Player 1. This means I keep [1, 6, 2, 4, 0].\n         * My value: 1*67 + 6*47 + 2*77 + 4*71 + 0*65 = 67 + 282 + 154 + 284 = 787\n         * Discounted value: 787 * 0.9 = 708.3\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer (126.9) is much lower than my outside offer (687).\n    * A counteroffer where I keep [1, 7, 3, 6, 0] would yield a total discounted value of 947.7, and is better than the outside offer.\n    * A counteroffer where I keep [1, 6, 2, 4, 0] would yield a total discounted value of 708.3, and is also better than the outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible, significantly less than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away is not my best move since I could make a counteroffer better than my outside offer.\n*   I will make a counteroffer to try to get the best deal for myself. I will offer [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1, which means I keep [1, 7, 3, 6, 0]. This maximizes my value, and offers something to Player 1.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 164\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 19\n    *   Item 2: 98\n    *   Item 3: 50\n    *   Item 4: 75\n    *   Item 5: 37\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 3\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that the value of a deal decreases each round it takes to complete by 0.9. So the current round 2 will get discounted by 0.9^1 = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I receive nothing from the deal.\n    *   Value of current offer to me: 0\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider what happens if I were to keep everything:\n    *   3 units of item 1 = 3 * 19 = 57\n    *   3 units of item 2 = 3 * 98 = 294\n    *   4 units of item 3 = 4 * 50 = 200\n    *   2 units of item 4 = 2 * 75 = 150\n    *   3 units of item 5 = 3 * 37 = 111\n    *   Total value = 57 + 294 + 200 + 150 + 111 = 812. \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer (0) is much worse than my outside offer (164). If this deal was accepted, I would be making a big mistake. \n   *  If I keep everything my value is 812, which discounted by gamma at round 2 is 812*0.9= 730.8.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n    *   The current offer is terrible for me, as I get nothing. \n    *   I should not accept the current offer because 0 is less than 164.\n    *   Walking away would be a reasonable option since I could get 164.\n    *   Let's look for a possible counteroffer. The previous offer I made was [0,0,1,0,0] which was then countered by the offer of [0,0,0,0,0]. Let's try to be more aggressive and offer to give the other player 1 of everything except item 2 which I value more. Therefore I will offer [1,0,1,1,1]. This gives them value of one item of everything except item 2 and I retain a large amount for myself.\n     * If I keep this, I receive:\n      * 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 19 = 38\n      * 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 98 = 294\n      * 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 50 = 150\n      * 1 units of item 4 = 1 * 75 = 75\n      * 2 units of item 5 = 2 * 37 = 74\n      * Total value = 38+294+150+75+74=631\n      * Discounted value = 631 * 0.9 = 567.9\n\n**Decision:**\nIt is better to counteroffer than walk away since a counteroffer has the potential for a bigger payoff than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

The current offer yields a value of 657.72, which is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of getting all items (and thus player 1 nothing) is worth 657.72 after discounting. My outside offer is worth 164. \n*   Since this is the final round, If I don't accept I will be making a counteroffer, and this is automatically treated as a WALK, which gives me my outside offer value of 164.\n*   The current offer is far better than my outside offer, so I should accept.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action for Player 1 in round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 298. This is the minimum value I want to achieve through negotiation.\n*   **Item values:** My private values for items are:\n    *   Item 1: 48\n    *   Item 2: 3\n    *   Item 3: 15\n    *   Item 4: 26\n    *   Item 5: 96\n*   **Total pool of items:** There are 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, and 7 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less than offers in earlier rounds (0.9^r-1)\n    \n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since it is the first round, my offer will be a counter offer if I do not choose to walk. I want to propose something that will give me value greater than my outside offer. I also want to give away enough that it is reasonable for player 2 to take a deal. I need to consider how my values compare to what I assume the other player's values will be. The total values of the items to me is 1001. Player 2's values should also be roughly similar, since they are drawn from the same random distribution, and I will be offering a subset of items. If I give them half of each item I will achieve a reasonable division, but I may be able to do better. If I offer all of the items and get nothing I am clearly worse off, the same is true if I offer nothing at all. To avoid mistake 3, it makes sense to offer a reasonable subset of the items. I should try to keep the most valuable items to me. Given that item 5 is my most valuable item, item 4 is my next most valuable item, I will try to keep as many of those items as possible. Items 1, 2, and 3 are relatively low value for me.\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 2 the following:\n    *   1 unit of item 1 (value to me: 48)\n    *   1 unit of item 2 (value to me: 3)\n    *   2 unit of item 3 (value to me: 15*2 = 30)\n    *   3 unit of item 4 (value to me: 26*3 = 78)\n    *   3 unit of item 5 (value to me: 96*3 = 288)\n        \n    This would leave me with:\n        *   1 unit of item 1 (value to me: 48)\n        *   1 unit of item 2 (value to me: 3)\n        *   1 unit of item 3 (value to me: 15)\n        *   4 unit of item 4 (value to me: 26*4 = 104)\n        *   4 unit of item 5 (value to me: 96*4 = 384)\n\n    My value with the counteroffer is 48+3+15+104+384= 554. This is greater than my outside offer. The values of the items offered to player 2 are 48+3+30+78+288 = 447. The total value is 554+447 = 1001, which is my total value for all items combined. \n\n    If I make a counteroffer giving player 2 the following it may be reasonable:\n    *   1 unit of item 1 \n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   3 units of item 4\n    *   3 units of item 5\n        \n    Then, I would keep\n        *   1 unit of item 1 (value: 48)\n        *   1 unit of item 2 (value: 3)\n        *   2 unit of item 3 (value: 15*2=30)\n        *   4 unit of item 4 (value: 26*4=104)\n        *   4 unit of item 5 (value: 96*4 = 384)\n    The total value for me would be 48 + 3 + 30 + 104 + 384 = 569.\n    This is also greater than the outside offer of 298.\n\n    Let's try a different split.\n    If I offer the following to Player 2:\n      *  0 unit of item 1\n      *  0 unit of item 2\n      *  0 unit of item 3\n      *  3 unit of item 4\n      *  3 unit of item 5\n\n    Then, I would keep\n      *  2 unit of item 1 (value: 96)\n      *  2 unit of item 2 (value: 6)\n      *  3 unit of item 3 (value: 45)\n      *  4 unit of item 4 (value: 104)\n      *  4 unit of item 5 (value: 384)\n\n    The total value for me would be 96 + 6 + 45 + 104 + 384 = 635.\n    This is also greater than the outside offer of 298. This offer would be worse for player 2 though.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will offer the following:\n\n*   1 unit of item 1\n*   1 unit of item 2\n*   1 unit of item 3\n*   3 units of item 4\n*   3 units of item 5\n\nThis is a reasonable starting position and gives me a higher value than my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 3, 3]}\n```\n",

Since it is Round 1, discount factor does not apply to it, meaning this value is not discounted.\n    \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 758 < 1227. The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's think about a few scenarios:\n        *   I could offer Player 1 half of each item, that is [1, 1, 1, 3, 3]. Which would leave me with [1, 1, 2, 4, 4] which we calculated above to be worth 758, lower than my outside option of 1227, not worth it.\n        *  To have a value greater than my outside option I need to at least offer Player 1 less.\n        *  A more generous counteroffer to Player 1 might be to offer them 1 of each of the first 3 items, and 2 of items 4 and 5 [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]. Which leaves me with 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 5 of item 4 and 5 of item 5, with a total value of  (1 * 76) + (1 * 72) + (2 * 35) + (5 * 85) + (5 * 50) = 76 + 72 + 70 + 425 + 250 = 893. Still not worth it.\n         *  What if I offer [0,0,0,1,1]? Then I would keep [2, 2, 3, 6, 6], for a value of 2 * 76 + 2 * 72 + 3 * 35 + 6 * 85 + 6 * 50 = 152 + 144 + 105 + 510 + 300 = 1211.

My value is 2*76 + 2*72 + 2*35 + 5*85 + 5*50 = 152 + 144 + 70 + 425 + 250 = 1041, not enough.\n\n*  Let's try offering player 1 [0,0,1,1,1]. which means I keep [2, 2, 2, 6, 6] for a value of 2*76 + 2*72 + 2*35 + 6*85 + 6*50 = 152 + 144 + 70 + 510 + 300 = 1176, not enough.\n\n* Let's try offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 2, 2], I keep [2,2,3,5,5].

I'll look at a few options:\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** Give the other player 0 of everything.

Discounted by 0.9 this is 1166.4\n    * If I counteroffer [1, 1, 1, 2, 2], my value is:\n       (1*76) + (1*72) + (2*35) + (5*85) + (5*50) = 76 + 72 + 70 + 425 + 250 = 893.  Discounted by 0.9 this is 803.7.\n  Since the value of my current offer of 682.2 is less than my outside offer of 1227, I should not accept.  Since this is not the final round, I should make a counteroffer.\n\nI see that in my previous move, I offered [0,0,0,0,1], but that the current offer on the table is still [1,1,1,3,3].

Discounted by 0.9 this is 1166.4\n\nIf I offer [0,0,0,0,0] my payoff is 0, so this is suboptimal. Let's try offering [1,1,1,2,2]. Then I would keep:\n(1 * 76) + (1 * 72) + (2 * 35) + (5 * 85) + (5 * 50) = 76 + 72 + 70 + 425 + 250 = 893.  Discounted by 0.9, this is 803.7, which is less than my outside offer.\n\nSince I can't get an offer better than my outside offer in round 2, I should just counteroffer, knowing I'll probably walk in round 3. I don't want to offer the same as player 1 since that would still be worse than my outside offer. I am going to offer [0,0,0,0,1] again, since that was my best value counteroffer in round 1.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince my outside offer is better than the current offer and there's still another round to go, I should make a counteroffer. I will offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], which keeps the most value for me.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 253\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 6, Item 2: 20, Item 3: 78, Item 4: 61, Item 5: 27\n*   **Total items:** 4 units of Item 1, 5 units of Item 2, 3 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** Gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [2, 3, 1, 0, 0]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n\n    My value for this is:\n    (2 * 6) + (2 * 20) + (2 * 78) + (1 * 61) + (1 * 27) = 12 + 40 + 156 + 61 + 27 = 296\n    Discounted value of accepting current offer: 296 * 0.9 = 266.4\n\n*   **Comparing to outside offer:** The discounted value of accepting the current offer (266.4) is greater than my outside offer (253).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I could propose a different split, but since the current offer is already better than my outside offer, I should not propose an offer that is worse for myself. Let's consider some possibilities but first see what is the most I can get if I were to take all the items for myself.\n    * Maximum possible value is (4*6)+(5*20)+(3*78)+(1*61)+(1*27) = 24+100+234+61+27 = 446\n   Since current discounted offer is 266.4 and this is round 2, the best value after discounting is 446 * 0.9 = 401.4. Any counteroffer should be better than 253. I need to avoid making mistake 1: an offer worse than the current offer for me. \n    * My previous offer was [2, 2, 1, 0, 0] which gave me a value of 296 * 0.9 = 266.4 if I accepted.\n     * I could try to keep everything, which would give me 446 which is greater than the discounted current offer. However, it would make no sense to offer player 2 [0,0,0,0,0] as they will not accept and I would rather just take the current discounted offer.\n    * Let's try to improve on the current offer by keeping 1 more unit of item 3.  That is, keep 3 units of item 3, and offer the opponent [2, 3, 0, 0, 0]. This gives me\n     (2 * 6) + (2 * 20) + (3 * 78) + (1 * 61) + (1 * 27) = 12+40+234+61+27 = 374. 374*0.9 = 336.6, which is better than the current offer.\n      \n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is better than my outside offer, it is better to accept that offer than to risk walking away.\nI do have to consider that making a counteroffer could be better for me, but any counteroffer has a risk of ending the game with a walk. Since it is round 2 and we are discounting by 0.9 I will accept the current offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

I need to make an offer that is better than my outside offer value, which also should leave room for future offers.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I cannot accept. Also, walking away is not ideal because a negotiation deal might give me a higher value. Therefore, I should propose a counteroffer. Let's consider offering the other player 1 unit of each item type. This would allow me to retain more valuable items for myself and still leaves the possibility of some negotiation.\n\n*   If I give Player 2 1 unit of each item:\n    *   I keep 3 units of item 1: 3 * 38 = 114\n    *   I keep 2 units of item 2: 2 * 54 = 108\n    *   I keep 7 units of item 3: 7 * 5 = 35\n    *   I keep 2 units of item 4: 2 * 57 = 114\n    *   I keep 6 units of item 5: 6 * 75 = 450\n    *   Total value for me: 114 + 108 + 35 + 114 + 450 = 821\n\nThis value (821) is significantly greater than my outside offer of 202.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 202. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 687 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 41, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 37, Item 4: 8, Item 5: 97.\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times what it would be in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.9*0.9=0.81 times what it would be in round 1. Since we are at round 1 the discount is 0.9^(1-1)=1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since it is round 1, I will propose an initial counteroffer. I need to propose something that is better than my outside offer. The worst offer I can make is offering all of my items to player 2 which gives me a value of 0. Since I value items 1 and 5 much more than items 2, 3 and 4, I'll propose to keep the majority of items 1 and 5 and give away most of items 2, 3 and 4. \n    Let's consider an offer where I offer Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5. This means I keep: 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5. My total value for this offer is:\n    (4 * 41) + (1 * 6) + (1 * 37) + (1 * 8) + (2 * 97) = 164 + 6 + 37 + 8 + 194 = 409. This is higher than my outside offer of 389.\n\nLet's test a second possible counteroffer: offer Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5. This means I keep: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5. My total value for this offer is:\n    (3 * 41) + (1 * 6) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 8) + (2 * 97) = 123 + 6 + 37 + 16 + 194 = 376. This is lower than my outside offer of 389. So the previous offer is better.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will propose the first counteroffer, since it results in a higher value than my outside offer and will give me a good starting point in the negotiation.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

Let's consider an example counteroffer where I propose to give Player 1: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means that I would keep:\n    * Item 1: 4 units (5-1)\n    * Item 2: 2 units (2-0)\n    * Item 3: 2 units (2-0)\n    * Item 4: 2 units (3-1)\n    * Item 5: 3 units (3-0)\nMy value would then be: 4 * 59 + 2 * 79 + 2 * 85 + 2 * 88 + 3 * 88 = 236 + 158 + 170 + 176 + 264 = 1004. \n    \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 487, which is less than my outside offer of 854.

My example counteroffer gives me a value of 1004, which is more than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is less than my outside offer. I will not accept it. I should definitely counteroffer. I want to secure a deal that gives me more value than my outside offer, while accounting for the discount factor in later rounds. I will make a counteroffer that gets me a good amount, while also giving player 1 something.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 389\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 41, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 37, Item 4: 8, Item 5: 97\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9 if we reach a deal in this round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer on the table is that I receive [1, 0, 0, 1, 0] of items from Player 2. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. My value for this is:\n    (1 * 41) + (0 * 6) + (0 * 37) + (1 * 8) + (0 * 97) = 41 + 8 = 49.\n    The discounted value of this is 49 * 0.9 = 44.1\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 44.1 to me after discounting, which is much worse than my outside offer of 389. Therefore, accepting this is a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Considerations for counteroffer:**\n    *   I need to propose something that is more valuable to me than 389 * 0.9 = 350.1 if the deal goes through now. \n    *   I need to be realistic about what Player 2 would accept. If I offer too little, they might walk away.\n    *   Mistake 1 is avoided by making a counteroffer that is better for me than the current offer and my past offer. My last offer was to give away [1, 1, 1, 2, 1] to Player 2, which means I keep [4, 1, 1, 1, 2]. This is worth (4*41)+(1*6)+(1*37)+(1*8)+(2*97) = 164+6+37+8+194 = 409. The discounted value of that offer was 409 * 0.9 ^ (1-1) = 409 which is better than my outside offer.\n    *   Mistake 2 is avoided by making an offer worth more than my outside offer. \n    *   Mistake 3 is avoided by offering something to Player 2.\n    *   Mistake 5 is avoided by not walking away from an offer that is better than my outside offer.\n    \n\nI should try to offer something that improves my position, but also might be acceptable to Player 2, while remembering that we are in round 2, meaning that if we don't reach a deal now the outcome will be worse for both of us if we reach round 3.\nI will make a counteroffer that gives Player 2 more of the items I value less and keeps more of the items I value most. The items I value least are 2, 4 and the ones I value the most are 5, 1, then 3.\n\nI will offer [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] which means I would keep [5, 1, 1, 2, 2]. The value of this to me would be: (5*41)+(1*6)+(1*37)+(2*8)+(2*97) = 205 + 6 + 37 + 16 + 194 = 458. This value is higher than my outside offer and higher than my last offer, so avoids Mistake 1 and 2.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should NOT accept the current offer.\n*   I should NOT walk away.\n*   I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means any deal in this round is worth 90% of its undiscounted value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. \n    *   My value for this offer is (0 * 59) + (1 * 79) + (1 * 85) + (1 * 88) + (1 * 88) = 0 + 79 + 85 + 88 + 88 = 340.\n    *   Discounted value of this offer = 340 * 0.9 = 306.\n\n*   **Previous Round Offer:** Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]. This means I would have received 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My value would have been (1*59) + (1*79) + (1*85) + (2*88) + (1*88) = 59+79+85+176+88 = 487. The discounted value would have been 487*1 = 487\n    *   My previous counteroffer was [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]. Which means I would have kept 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.

To get a value of 854 we would want the total value to be 854 / .9 which equals about 949. \n    * Let's try offering [1, 0, 0, 1, 0] to player 1 again: I would keep 4, 2, 2, 2, and 3, which has a value of 1004. Discounted value is 1004 * 0.9 = 903.6\n    * Let's try offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 1: This means I would keep all the items. This has a value of (5*59) + (2*79) + (2*85) + (3*88) + (3*88) = 295+158+170+264+264= 1151.

Accepting is not optimal. \n*   My previous counteroffer gives me a discounted value of 903.6 which is more than my outside offer value, and so is my offer of [0,0,0,0,0] with 1035.9.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step and determine the optimal action for Player 1 in Round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 861\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 73\n    *   Item 3: 23\n    *   Item 4: 66\n    *   Item 5: 61\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 8 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal in later rounds will be worth less. If the process concludes after round 1, there is no discount. If it concludes after round 2, the value is multiplied by 0.9. If it concludes after round 3 the value is multiplied by 0.9^2.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** As it's round 1 and I am Player 1, I am the one making the first offer. I will need to create a list of numbers that represent what I will offer to Player 2 for each of the items.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** Any offer must yield a value greater than my outside offer value of 861 in order to be beneficial for me in the current round.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince I am Player 1 and there is no offer on the table, I have to make the first offer. I should create an offer that I think Player 2 will accept, but that also provides me with a value greater than 861. It's important to leave Player 2 with an incentive to accept to avoid a costly delay to round 2 and the associated discount. If I was to offer Player 2 0 units of everything, it would be an obviously suboptimal move. I should also avoid offering player 2 everything, as this would leave me with 0 value, less than my outside offer.\n\nI can maximize my value by keeping the items that have high value for me. I would like to keep all of item 2 and 4 for myself, as they have the highest value for me (73 and 66 respectively). The total value for these items for me is 8*73 + 5*66 = 584+330=914. I also know that I have to leave enough value to encourage the other player to accept the offer in the first round to avoid a discount from the delay.\n\nLet me consider an offer where I give player 2 half of each of the other items, plus 1 unit of item 1 (so leaving 1 unit for me). My offer to player 2 would be [1, 0, 3, 0, 3].\n\n*   My value from the remaining items would be 1\\*3 + 8\\*73 + 3\\*23 + 5*66+ 3*61 = 3 + 584 + 69 + 330 + 183 = 1167. This is more than my outside offer, so is a worthwhile offer to make.\n*   Player 2 might find this offer to be acceptable and is probably better than their outside offer, which should be a random value from 1 to their total value.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will make a counteroffer to Player 2, offering them 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 3, and 3 units of item 5. I will keep the rest of the items.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 3, 0, 3]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 3, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 861\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 73, Item 3: 23, Item 4: 66, Item 5: 61\n*   **Total pool of items:** 2 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means any deal accepted in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times its undiscounted value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 2, 2, 2, 2], meaning I receive:\n    *   2 units of item 1:  2 * 3 = 6\n    *   6 units of item 2: 6 * 73 = 438\n    *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 23 = 92\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 66 = 198\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 61 = 244\n    *   Total undiscounted value: 6 + 438 + 92 + 198 + 244 = 978\n    *   Total discounted value: 978 * 0.9 = 880.2\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (880.2) is greater than my outside offer (861).\n\n*  **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   Since round 1 involved offers of [1, 0, 3, 0, 3] and [0, 2, 2, 2, 2], I might consider a middle ground. Since this is round 2, I should aim to make it palatable to player 2 to increase the likelihood of acceptance. Let's consider offering player 2 [0, 3, 2, 2, 2]. This would mean I keep:\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 3 = 6\n        *   5 units of item 2: 5 * 73 = 365\n        *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 23 = 92\n        *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 66 = 198\n        *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 61 = 244\n        *   Total value: 6 + 365 + 92 + 198 + 244= 905\n        *   Discounted value of my counteroffer: 905 * 0.9 = 814.5 which is less than my outside offer. So this would be a mistake.\n\n    *    Let's also consider counter offering [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n       *  2 units of item 1: 2 * 3 = 6\n        *  7 units of item 2: 7 * 73 = 511\n        *  5 units of item 3: 5 * 23 = 115\n        *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 66 = 264\n        *   5 units of item 5: 5 * 61 = 305\n       *  Total value: 6 + 511 + 115 + 264 + 305 = 1201\n        * Discounted value of my counteroffer: 1201 * 0.9 = 1080.9\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer has a discounted value of 880.2 which is greater than my outside offer of 861.\n*   My potential counter offer of [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] provides me with more value 1080.9, while also not being too greedy.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

I will consider a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a bit more, keeping slightly less for myself. The last counteroffer I made was [0, 2, 2, 2, 2] which is worth 960. We are in round 2 now so a counteroffer would be discounted by 0.9.\n    *    Let's consider giving them [0, 2, 2, 1, 1] which means I receive: \n    2 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n    (2 * 10) + (6 * 84) + (4 * 85) + (4 * 12) + (5 * 15) = 20 + 504 + 340 + 48 + 75 = 987.

Giving away nothing (or everything) at this stage is a bad move.\n    Let's start by considering an offer where both players get a roughly equal share of items with some bias toward my more valuable items.\n\n    * Offer: Give Player 2:\n        * 1 unit of item 1\n        * 1 unit of item 2\n        * 2 units of item 3\n        * 2 units of item 4\n        * 3 units of item 5\n\n     If I offer this, that means I would keep:\n        * 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 41 = 82\n        * 1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 87 = 87\n        * 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 38 = 114\n        * 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 78 = 234\n        * 4 units of item 5 = 4 * 54 = 216\n        * Total: 82 + 87 + 114 + 234 + 216 = 733\n\n     This offer gives me 733.\n     I must compare the following counteroffer to my outside offer of 1091.\n     Since 733 is worse than my outside offer, I should not offer this. I must offer something better than 1091 to benefit from this round's action.\n\n    * Revised Offer: Give Player 2:\n        * 0 units of item 1\n        * 0 units of item 2\n        * 1 unit of item 3\n        * 1 unit of item 4\n        * 2 units of item 5\n\n     If I offer this, that means I would keep:\n        * 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 41 = 123\n        * 2 unit of item 2 = 2 * 87 = 174\n        * 4 units of item 3 = 4 * 38 = 152\n        * 4 units of item 4 = 4 * 78 = 312\n        * 5 units of item 5 = 5 * 54 = 270\n        * Total: 123 + 174 + 152 + 312 + 270 = 1031\n\n    This offer gives me 1031, which is also worse than my outside offer. I should not offer this.\n        \n    * Second Revised Offer: Give Player 2:\n        * 0 units of item 1\n        * 0 units of item 2\n        * 0 units of item 3\n        * 1 unit of item 4\n        * 2 units of item 5\n\n     If I offer this, that means I would keep:\n        * 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 41 = 123\n        * 2 unit of item 2 = 2 * 87 = 174\n        * 5 units of item 3 = 5 * 38 = 190\n        * 4 units of item 4 = 4 * 78 = 312\n        * 5 units of item 5 = 5 * 54 = 270\n        * Total: 123 + 174 + 190 + 312 + 270 = 1069\n     This offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n    * Third Revised Offer: Give Player 2:\n         * 0 units of item 1\n         * 0 units of item 2\n         * 0 units of item 3\n         * 0 units of item 4\n         * 2 units of item 5\n\n     If I offer this, that means I would keep:\n         * 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 41 = 123\n         * 2 unit of item 2 = 2 * 87 = 174\n         * 5 units of item 3 = 5 * 38 = 190\n         * 5 units of item 4 = 5 * 78 = 390\n         * 5 units of item 5 = 5 * 54 = 270\n         * Total = 123+174+190+390+270 = 1147\n      This offer is better than my outside offer of 1091.\n\n    * Fourth Revised Offer: Give Player 2:\n        * 0 units of item 1\n        * 0 units of item 2\n        * 0 units of item 3\n        * 0 units of item 4\n        * 1 units of item 5\n\n     If I offer this, that means I would keep:\n         * 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 41 = 123\n         * 2 unit of item 2 = 2 * 87 = 174\n         * 5 units of item 3 = 5 * 38 = 190\n         * 5 units of item 4 = 5 * 78 = 390\n         * 6 units of item 5 = 6 * 54 = 324\n         * Total = 123+174+190+390+324 = 1201\n      This offer is better than my outside offer of 1091.\n\n    * Fifth Revised Offer: Give Player 2:\n        * 0 units of item 1\n        * 0 units of item 2\n        * 0 units of item 3\n        * 0 units of item 4\n        * 0 units of item 5\n\n     If I offer this, that means I would keep:\n         * 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 41 = 123\n         * 2 unit of item 2 = 2 * 87 = 174\n         * 5 units of item 3 = 5 * 38 = 190\n         * 5 units of item 4 = 5 * 78 = 390\n         * 7 units of item 5 = 7 * 54 = 378\n         * Total = 123+174+190+390+378=1255\n     This offer is better than my outside offer of 1091, but its very greedy.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I shouldn't walk away because there is no offer to walk away from.\n*   I shouldn't accept any offer because there is no offer currently on the table\n*   I should propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer of 1091.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means that any deal made in later rounds is worth less than a deal made now.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive all items.\n    *   My value if I accept: (3 * 81) + (2 * 46) + (5 * 90) + (5 * 90) + (7 * 14) = 243 + 92 + 450 + 450 + 98 = 1333\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I will consider a counteroffer where I give some of the items to player 1. For now, let's focus on one potential counteroffer in which I give one unit of every item type to player 1 and keep the rest for myself.\n    *   My value for keeping [2, 1, 4, 4, 6]: (2 * 81) + (1 * 46) + (4 * 90) + (4 * 90) + (6 * 14) = 162 + 46 + 360 + 360 + 84 = 1012\n    *   My value for keeping [1,0,2,2,3]: (1*81) + (0*46) + (2*90) + (2*90) + (3*14) = 81 + 0 + 180 + 180 + 42 = 483\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** Accepting the current offer (which gives me all items) is worth 1333, much higher than my outside offer of 875. A counteroffer where I give one unit of each item to player 1 is worth 1012 to me, which is also higher than my outside offer. Keeping only a portion of the items gives me less than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is very good for me, yielding a value of 1333, higher than my outside offer of 875. A reasonable counteroffer where I keep most items would also be acceptable. I will make a counteroffer that will benefit me while also being plausible for player 1. I will offer 1 unit of items 1, 2, 3 and 4 and 2 units of item 5. This would leave me with a value of (2*81) + (1*46) + (4*90) + (4*90) + (5*14) = 162 + 46 + 360 + 360 + 70 = 998 which is much greater than 875.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 875\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 81\n    *   Item 2: 46\n    *   Item 3: 90\n    *   Item 4: 90\n    *   Item 5: 14\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 7 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we're in round 2, any deal will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive all the items. My value for this offer is:\n    *   3 * 81 = 243\n    *   2 * 46 = 92\n    *   5 * 90 = 450\n    *   5 * 90 = 450\n    *   7 * 14 = 98\n    *   Total: 243 + 92 + 450 + 450 + 98 = 1333\n    *   Discounted value: 1333 * 0.9 = 1199.7\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (discounted value 1199.7) is significantly better than my outside offer (875).\n\n* **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider the value of making a counteroffer in the current round versus the risk of getting a deal worse than my outside offer in the next round, or even no deal at all. Because the other player offered [0,0,0,0,0] twice, it is likely they place little value on the items. My best strategy, therefore, is to try to end the negotiation with a good deal for myself now, rather than risk it all in the next round. Therefore I will make a counteroffer that is favorable to myself, giving up few items. \n\n   Let's consider a counteroffer of giving Player 1 [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]:\n   My value for my portion of the items would then be:\n    * Item 1: (3 - 0) * 81 = 243\n    * Item 2: (2 - 0) * 46 = 92\n    * Item 3: (5 - 1) * 90 = 360\n    * Item 4: (5 - 1) * 90 = 360\n    * Item 5: (7 - 2) * 14 = 70\n    * Total value: 243+92+360+360+70 = 1125\n    * Discounted value: 1125 * 0.9 = 1012.5\n  \n    This value is greater than my outside option value of 875.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1) is worth 1199.7 to me, which is better than my outside offer value of 875.\n*   If I make a counteroffer I may lose this deal, so I would not walk away.\n*   I should not accept an offer that gives me less than 875.\n*   I should try to get as much as I can for myself now, as it is likely this negotiation is not going to continue if I don't get what I want. Therefore, I should make a counteroffer rather than just accepting the current offer. \n    \n    Based on this, I will make a counteroffer, where I keep most of the items, keeping at least the 3 units of item 1 and 2 units of item 2. I will offer [0,0,1,1,2] to Player 1\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

Since it's round 3, the discount factor will be 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer: (0 * 41) + (0 * 87) + (1 * 38) + (1 * 78) + (2 * 54) = 0 + 0 + 38 + 78 + 108 = 224.\n    *   Discounted value of accepting this offer: 224 * 0.81 = 181.44\n*   **Counteroffers:** I need to consider the value of different counteroffers. I want to maximize my value, while ensuring it remains greater than my outside offer value (1091). Since this is the last round, any counteroffer by Player 2 will be treated as a WALK.\n    Let's calculate my value if I propose giving Player 2 the minimum number of items possible (which maximizes my value). This would mean giving them 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. If I made this counteroffer, my own value would be \n    (3 * 41) + (2 * 87) + (5 * 38) + (5 * 78) + (7 * 54) = 123 + 174 + 190 + 390 + 378 = 1255.\n    If I made a different counteroffer (e.g. [1,1,1,1,1]) my value would be:\n     ((3-1) * 41) + ((2-1) * 87) + ((5-1) * 38) + ((5-1) * 78) + ((7-1) * 54)  = 82 + 87 + 152 + 312 + 324 = 957\n    Since this is the final round, it might be wise to make an offer that allows me to get some value, but not the absolute maximum. If my counteroffer gives me a value below 1091, I might as well walk away.\n    \n    My total value with no counteroffer is 1255. Giving all the items to the other player would leave me with 0 value. I need to keep at least some amount of my items such that the total value will be above 1091.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The discounted value of the current offer (181.44) is significantly lower than my outside offer value (1091).\n*   Walking away would give me 1091.\n*   I can make a counteroffer to get more value.\n   Since this is the last round, if I make an offer that maximizes my value I will get a payoff of 1255, which would give me a discounted payoff of 1255*0.81 = 1016.55. If I offered the other player something, and they rejected it, I get my outside offer, so I have to make sure my counteroffer has value higher than 1091.\n   I will make a counteroffer where I get the max value possible.\n    My counteroffer to Player 2 will be to give 0 units of each item.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on an action for Round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 955. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 9 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 89 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 18 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 14 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 30 per unit\n*   **Total items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6 units\n    *   Item 2: 8 units\n    *   Item 3: 7 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that if negotiations conclude in later rounds, the value of the outcome will be reduced (e.g. at round 2 by multiplying by 0.9, and round 3 by multiplying by 0.9*0.9=0.81). This incentivizes reaching an agreement sooner. In round 1, the discount factor is 1 (0.9^0) so it doesn't affect the value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so no action can be taken to accept.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to formulate an offer that is better than my outside offer, but also good enough for Player 2 to consider.  I will not make an offer that is worse than my outside offer.\n    *   Let's consider a starting point of offering the other player half the items. This provides a good basis to begin with, that is unlikely to be rejected out of hand, and from which I can adjust in subsequent rounds if needed. I will round down if there is an odd number of items available. This is equivalent to keeping at least half of each item for myself.\n        *   Offer Player 2: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n    *   If I offer the above, I keep: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of this offer to me is:\n        *   3 * 9 = 27\n        *   4 * 89 = 356\n        *   4 * 18 = 72\n        *   2 * 14 = 28\n        *   2 * 30 = 60\n        *   Total = 27 + 356 + 72 + 28 + 60 = 543. \n    *   This is less than my outside offer, which means this is a bad offer. I must improve my offer to ensure it is better than my outside offer of 955. I will keep the same proportions but double the amount I keep, which will mean I keep all items of types 1 and 4. \n    * Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n    *   If I offer the above, I keep: 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n        *   Value of this offer to me is:\n        *   6 * 9 = 54\n        *   4 * 89 = 356\n        *   4 * 18 = 72\n        *   3 * 14 = 42\n        *   2 * 30 = 60\n        *   Total = 54 + 356 + 72 + 42 + 60 = 584.\n        This is still not better than my outside offer. \n    * I need to keep more of the high value items. How about if I only offer 1 unit each of item 2, 3 and 5.\n    * Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n    * If I offer the above, I keep: 6 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n        *   Value of this offer to me is:\n        *   6 * 9 = 54\n        *   7 * 89 = 623\n        *   6 * 18 = 108\n        *   3 * 14 = 42\n        *   3 * 30 = 90\n        *   Total = 54 + 623 + 108 + 42 + 90 = 917.\n        This is still not better than my outside offer. It appears I need to keep almost all of the items if I want a better deal than my outside offer.\n        How about if I offer 1 unit of only the lowest value item, item 4.\n         * Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 unit of item 5\n          * If I offer the above, I keep: 6 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n            *   Value of this offer to me is:\n            *   6 * 9 = 54\n            *   8 * 89 = 712\n            *   7 * 18 = 126\n            *   2 * 14 = 28\n            *   4 * 30 = 120\n            *   Total = 54 + 712 + 126 + 28 + 120 = 1040\n        This is better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer, since there is no current offer to accept.\n*   I should not walk away, since I have identified a counteroffer that provides a value greater than my outside offer.\n*   I should propose a specific counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, but still may be accepted by the other player.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

This means I get:\n    *   6 units of item 1: 6 * 46 = 276\n    *   8 units of item 2: 8 * 98 = 784\n    *   7 units of item 3: 7 * 32 = 224\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 36 = 72\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 84 = 336\n    *   Total value: 276 + 784 + 224 + 72 + 336 = 1692.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to consider counteroffers that are better than my outside offer of 170.\n   I want to propose an offer that doesn't give away too much.  Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent in the early rounds is also a mistake.\n    I will try to offer the other agent a small amount.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n    *   Accepting the current offer would yield me a total value of 1692.\n    *   My outside offer is 170.\n    *   Since 1692 > 170, and given I'm not in the final round, I should counteroffer, instead of accepting.\n\n    I will start with offering a small amount for each item. Let's try offering one of each to the other player. This gives me:\n    * 5 units of item 1: 5*46 = 230\n    * 7 units of item 2: 7*98 = 686\n    * 6 units of item 3: 6*32 = 192\n    * 2 units of item 4: 2*36 = 72\n    * 3 units of item 5: 3*84 = 252\n    * Total = 1432\n    This is greater than 170, so it would be a valid counteroffer.\n\n    I'll try this:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

The current round is round 2.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 9 = 9\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 89 = 89\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 18 = 18\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 14 = 14\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 30 = 30\n    *   **Total value of current offer:** 9 + 89 + 18 + 14 + 30 = 160\n    *   **Discounted value of current offer:** 160 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 160 * 0.9 = 144\n\n*   **Comparing to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (144) is much less than my outside offer (955). Thus, accepting this offer would be a Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer that would give me a good return but is still reasonable. I currently have the following resources:\n    *  5 units of item 1 with value = 45\n    *  7 units of item 2 with value = 623\n    *  6 units of item 3 with value = 108\n    *  2 units of item 4 with value = 28\n    *  3 units of item 5 with value = 90\n  If I propose a counteroffer that gives the other player [2, 2, 2, 1, 1], then my items and values will be:\n    *  4 units of item 1 with value = 36\n    *  6 units of item 2 with value = 534\n    *  5 units of item 3 with value = 90\n    *  2 units of item 4 with value = 28\n    *  3 units of item 5 with value = 90\n    *   **Total value:**  36+534+90+28+90= 778\n    *  **Discounted value:** 778 * (0.9) ^ (2 - 1) =  700.2\n    *  This is still less than my outside offer\n\nIf I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], then my items and values will be:\n    *  6 units of item 1 with value = 54\n    *  8 units of item 2 with value = 712\n    *  7 units of item 3 with value = 126\n    *  3 units of item 4 with value = 42\n    *  4 units of item 5 with value = 120\n    *   **Total value:** 54 + 712 + 126 + 42 + 120 = 1054\n    *  **Discounted value:** 1054 * (0.9) ^ (2 - 1) =  948.6\n    *  This is still less than my outside offer\n\nIf I offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], then my items and values will be:\n    *  5 units of item 1 with value = 45\n    *  8 units of item 2 with value = 712\n    *  7 units of item 3 with value = 126\n    *  3 units of item 4 with value = 42\n    *  4 units of item 5 with value = 120\n    *   **Total value:**  45 + 712 + 126 + 42 + 120 = 1045\n    *  **Discounted value:** 1045 * (0.9) ^ (2 - 1) =  940.5\n    *  This is still less than my outside offer\n\nIf I offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], then my items and values will be:\n    *  6 units of item 1 with value = 54\n    *  7 units of item 2 with value = 623\n    *  7 units of item 3 with value = 126\n    *  3 units of item 4 with value = 42\n    *  4 units of item 5 with value = 120\n    *   **Total value:**  54 + 623 + 126 + 42 + 120 = 965\n    *  **Discounted value:** 965 * (0.9) ^ (2 - 1) =  868.5\n    *  This is still less than my outside offer\n\nSince the outside offer is so high compared to the value of the available items for me, it would be best to make sure the game does not proceed to the next round, as the discount rate will reduce the value of all of the items.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nGiven that the current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer, I should not accept. I will make a counteroffer.  I want to offer something that is very close to the total value, because my outside offer is so high. I will offer [0,0,0,0,0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Since we are in round 2, any deal now will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is currently offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive 0 of each item, for a total value of 0.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what might be a good counteroffer, but let's first assess my outside offer value. My outside offer is 170, if I walk away then my value is 170.

Since the round is coming to an end, my counteroffer would ideally give a value higher than my outside offer given the discount.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I receive the majority of the valuable items, and give up some of the less valuable ones to Player 1. I have 6 item 1, 8 item 2, 7 item 3, 3 item 4, and 4 item 5. I can offer 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best course of action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 649. This is my guaranteed fallback.\n*   **Item values:** My values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 22\n    *   Item 2: 25\n    *   Item 3: 13\n    *   Item 4: 93\n    *   Item 5: 41\n*   **Total items:** There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the same offer in round 1.  An offer in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times the value of the same offer in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1 = 0 * 22 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 25 = 25\n    *   0 units of item 3 = 0 * 13 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 4 = 0 * 93 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5 = 0 * 41 = 0\n    Total value from this offer is 0 + 25 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 25.  This is far below my outside offer of 649.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I will calculate the value of keeping all items to myself, since I need to know if I am making an offer better than my outside offer.\n     * 4 units of item 1 = 4 * 22 = 88\n     * 5 units of item 2 = 5 * 25 = 125\n     * 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 13 = 13\n     * 5 units of item 4 = 5 * 93 = 465\n     * 5 units of item 5 = 5 * 41 = 205\n     Total value of keeping all items = 88 + 125 + 13 + 465 + 205 = 896.\n     I want to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. Since this is the first round, I am going to start with an offer that would give me around 70% of the total value of the items. 70% of 896 is around 627, which is less than my outside offer, so I will go higher than that and make an offer that gives me a total value of 660 (just over my outside offer).\n     To give 660 to myself, I would need around:\n     * 4 units of item 1 = 4 * 22 = 88\n     * 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 25 = 50\n     * 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 13 = 13\n     * 5 units of item 4 = 5 * 93 = 465\n     * 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 41 = 41\n     Total value = 88 + 50 + 13 + 465 + 41 = 657. This offer is slightly lower than my outside offer, so instead I should:\n     * 4 units of item 1 = 4 * 22 = 88\n     * 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 25 = 75\n     * 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 13 = 13\n     * 5 units of item 4 = 5 * 93 = 465\n     * 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 41 = 41\n     Total value = 88 + 75 + 13 + 465 + 41 = 682. This is a better offer.\n     Therefore, my counteroffer would be [0, 2, 0, 0, 4]\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer of 25 is much worse than my outside offer of 649. My potential counteroffer would be better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible, so I will not accept it.\n*   Walking away would give me my outside offer of 649, but it is round 1 and I could potentially get a better outcome.\n*   Therefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 4]}\n```\n",

We'll focus on offers more favorable to me than the current, since I shouldn't give back more value than is already offered.\n    * Option 1: Offer to Player 1 what they offered last round [0,1,0,0,0].  This leaves me with value: 871. Discounted, this is 783.9.\n    * Option 2: Offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. I would keep everything: (4 * 22) + (5 * 25) + (1 * 13) + (5 * 93) + (5 * 41) = 88 + 125 + 13 + 465 + 205 = 896. Discounted, this is 896 * 0.9 = 806.4\n    * Option 3: Offer Player 1 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]. I would keep 4 units of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 5 of item 5. My value would be (4*22) + (3*25) + (1*13) + (5*93) + (5*41) = 88 + 75 + 13 + 465 + 205 = 846. Discounted this is 846 * 0.9 = 761.4.\n    * I will not consider offering more to player 1 than Option 1 because my value would only decrease further.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer gives me a discounted value of 783.9.\n*   Walking away gives me 649.\n*   Making a counter offer of [0,1,0,0,0] would give me the same value as accepting.\n*   Making a counter offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] would give me a value of 806.4, better than accepting.\n*   Making a counteroffer of [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] would give me 761.4 which is worse than the current offer.\n\nSince offering Player 1 [0,0,0,0,0] yields the best outcome for me. I should make this counteroffer.\nAlso, in round 3 I would be forced to walk as this is the last round. So it is better to make this counteroffer in round 2.\n\n**Final Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

How about I give them: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n    Then I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2\n    My value would then be:\n    *   1 * 51 = 51\n    *   3 * 89 = 267\n    *   1 * 65 = 65\n    *   2 * 44 = 88\n    *   2 * 70 = 140\n    * Total value: 611\n*  This is better than my outside offer of 468.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer has a value of 452, which is less than my outside offer of 468. Accepting this would be a mistake.\n*   I could walk away with my outside offer, but it might be better to try to make a deal if I can. \n*   My counteroffer is worth 611, which is greater than my outside offer and is not worse than my previous (nonexistent) offer.\n\nTherefore, I should make the counteroffer [0, 1, 0, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

I should therefore only consider accepting or walking.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer's discounted value of 122.31 is less than my outside offer value of 159.\n*   Since it is the last round, I cannot make a counteroffer, so it is a choice between accepting or walking.\n*   Accepting the offer yields a value of 122.31, while walking yields a value of 159.\n*   Therefore, I should walk.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

This gives me some incentive to conclude a deal sooner than later. \n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so no acceptance is required.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** As the first player on round 1, I need to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside option if I expect the game to continue.  I should avoid mistakes 2 and 3. Since I have a strong hand on items 2, 4 and 5, and an average hand on item 3, I will start with an offer that gives the other player a lot of items 1 and 3. A reasonable opening counteroffer for Player 1 would be something that is not too generous (as it's only round 1) but that still has the potential to lead to a profitable deal for both sides. Here are two options for the counteroffer:\n\n    **Option A:** Offer the other player: 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 0 unit of item 5. \n    *   This leaves me with: 0 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 unit of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer would be: 0 * 36 + 4 * 98 + 2 * 74 + 3 * 80 + 3 * 95 = 0 + 392 + 148 + 240 + 285 = 1065. This is better than my outside option.\n\n    **Option B:** Offer the other player: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n     * This leaves me with 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n     * My value for this offer would be: 1 * 36 + 4 * 98 + 3 * 74 + 2 * 80 + 2 * 95 = 36 + 392 + 222 + 160 + 190 = 1000.  This is better than my outside option, but worse than Option A.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, accepting is not an option.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 491\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 36, Item 2: 98, Item 3: 74, Item 4: 80, Item 5: 95\n*   **Total items:** 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means any deal we make in this round is worth 90% of its actual value compared to round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 2, 2, 1, 1].\n    *   My value from this offer:\n        *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 36 = 0\n        *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 98 = 196\n        *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 74 = 148\n        *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 80 = 80\n        *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 95 = 95\n        *   Total value: 0 + 196 + 148 + 80 + 95 = 519\n        *   Discounted value: 519 * 0.9 = 467.1\n    *   Comparing this to my outside offer of 491, the discounted value of the current offer is lower. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n    Let's consider a counteroffer to Player 2 of [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This would give me:\n        *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 36 = 36\n        *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 98 = 294\n        *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 74 = 222\n        *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 80 = 160\n        *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 95 = 190\n        *   Total value: 36 + 294 + 222 + 160 + 190 = 902\n        *   Discounted value: 902 * 0.9 = 811.8\n\n    This potential offer is much higher than my outside offer. We want to try to maximize our outcome. \n    Let's consider a counteroffer to Player 2 of [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This would give me:\n        *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 36 = 36\n        *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 98 = 392\n        *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 74 = 222\n        *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 80 = 160\n        *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 95 = 190\n        *   Total value: 36 + 392 + 222 + 160 + 190 = 1000\n        *   Discounted value: 1000 * 0.9 = 900.\n    This is even better than the other offer!\n    Let's try one more and offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This is the best offer I could make that isn't all items to myself.\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 36 = 36\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 98 = 392\n    *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 74 = 296\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 80 = 160\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 95 = 190\n    *   Total value = 36 + 392 + 296 + 160 + 190 = 1074\n    *   Discounted value = 1074 * 0.9 = 966.6.\n   \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of 467.1 is worse than my outside offer of 491, so I will not accept. I should propose a counteroffer to hopefully reach a deal before having to walk away at the end of the final round and receive my outside offer. The counteroffer of [0,0,0,1,1] yields a high value to me, much higher than my outside option, and gives something to the other player so they don't walk away either.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 269\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 55, Item 2: 88, Item 3: 26, Item 4: 70, Item 5: 83\n*   **Total items:** 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means any value we receive in this round is worth 0.9 times the value if we received it in round 1. This factor is already built in to the value comparisons below so is used implicitly not explicitly.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 55 = 165\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 88 = 264\n    *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 26 = 104\n    *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 70 = 280\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 83 = 249\n    *   Total value of current offer: 165 + 264 + 104 + 280 + 249 = 1062\n\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** 1062 > 269. The current offer is much better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's consider a few possible counteroffers and their values, as well as the original offer from Player 1 in round 1 for comparison:\n    *   **Original Round 1 offer:** Giving Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n        * 3 units of item 1: 3 * 55 = 165\n        * 2 units of item 2: 2 * 88 = 176\n        * 4 units of item 3: 4 * 26 = 104\n        * 4 units of item 4: 4 * 70 = 280\n        * 3 units of item 5: 3 * 83 = 249\n        * Total value of this potential counteroffer: 165 + 176 + 104 + 280 + 249 = 974\n\n    *   **Slightly more favorable counteroffer:** Giving Player 2 [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This means I would receive:\n        *   4 units of item 1: 4 * 55 = 220\n        *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 88 = 264\n        *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 26 = 104\n        *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 70 = 280\n        *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 83 = 332\n        *   Total Value of this potential counteroffer: 220 + 264 + 104 + 280 + 332 = 1200\n      *   **Slightly less favorable counteroffer:** Giving Player 2 [2, 1, 2, 2, 2]. This means I would receive:\n        *  2 units of item 1: 2 * 55 = 110\n        *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 88 = 176\n        *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 26 = 78\n        *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 70 = 210\n        *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 83 = 166\n        *   Total Value of this potential counteroffer: 110 + 176 + 78 + 210 + 166 = 740\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer from Player 2 is worth 1062, which is much better than my outside offer of 269.\n*    It is important to note that we have not yet applied the discount factor. Since we are now in round 2, we apply a discount of 0.9 to all values we calculate above.\n*  The discounted current offer is worth 1062 * 0.9 = 955.8. The discounted value for the original round 1 counteroffer (assuming it was being considered in round 2) would be 974 * 0.9 = 876.6. The other counteroffer values would also be discounted by 0.9.\n*  I could make a counteroffer to try and get more but the risk in that is that the other agent might walk and I would get my outside offer. \n*  Accepting the current offer is much safer, and better than the outside offer. Making another counteroffer is risky, so I should accept this round.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Since this is round 1, there is no discount applied to offers in this round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer, so accepting is not an option.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**  I need to propose an initial counteroffer. I should aim for a division that gives me a value greater than my outside offer (652). It's beneficial to keep more items with higher personal value. Let's explore a few options and calculate their worth. \n\n    *Option 1: Offer Player 2 1 unit of each item.*\n\n        *   Item 1: 1 unit * 39 = 39\n        *   Item 2: 1 unit * 71 = 71\n        *   Item 3: 1 unit * 60 = 60\n        *   Item 4: 1 unit * 89 = 89\n        *   Item 5: 1 unit * 54 = 54\n        *  Total value of what Player 2 would get is 313\n\n        I would keep 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. \n       My value would be:\n         1 * 39 + 3 * 71 + 4 * 60 + 4 * 89 + 1 * 54 = 39 + 213 + 240 + 356 + 54 = 902.\n        \n    *Option 2: Offer player 2 1 unit of item 3 and 1 of item 4.*\n\n        * Item 1: 2 * 39 = 78\n        * Item 2: 4 * 71 = 284\n        * Item 3: 4 * 60 = 240\n        * Item 4: 4 * 89 = 356\n        * Item 5: 2 * 54 = 108\n         Total value for me: 1066\n\n    Let's choose Option 1 because it offers good value while offering items to the opponent. 902 is greater than my outside offer of 652 so it's a good starting point.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer, as there isn't one.\n*   I should not walk away, since a reasonable counteroffer can be made above my outside offer value\n*   I should make a counteroffer. Option 1 seems like a good starting point. It gives the opponent some of each item while keeping me above my outside offer value.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 389\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 25\n    *   Item 2: 19\n    *   Item 3: 20\n    *   Item 4: 26\n    *   Item 5: 47\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  This means that an offer accepted in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times its value at round 1, and an offer accepted at round 3 will be worth 0.81 times its value at round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means they are proposing I get 1 unit of each item type. Let's calculate the value of that to me:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 25 = 25\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 19 = 19\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 20 = 20\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 26 = 26\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 47 = 47\n    *   Total value of current offer: 25 + 19 + 20 + 26 + 47 = 137\n\n    Since this value of 137 is significantly below my outside offer of 389, this is not an acceptable offer for me.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    I need to calculate potential counteroffers that are above my outside offer value of 389. I'll aim for a counteroffer where the division is better for me. Remember, the discount rate is .9 if there is a second round. I'll look at giving player 1 one unit of everything and keeping the rest.\n\n    *   Keeping:\n        *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 25 = 25\n        *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 19 = 57\n        *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 20 = 80\n        *   4 unit of item 4: 4 * 26 = 104\n        *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 47 = 47\n        *   Total: 313\n    *    If I offer the following to Player 1 and keep the rest for myself: [1,1,1,1,1]\n        This is worth 137, and keeping [1,3,4,4,1] is worth 313, for a total of 450, which is my full value of all items. This is not enough, I need to give Player 1 less.\n    *   Keeping:\n        *   2 unit of item 1: 2 * 25 = 50\n        *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 19 = 76\n        *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 20 = 100\n        *   5 unit of item 4: 5 * 26 = 130\n        *    2 unit of item 5: 2 * 47 = 94\n        *   Total: 450\n\n    If I offer [0,0,0,0,0] I keep 450. This would be a valid counter offer.\n    If I offer [0,1,1,1,0], I keep 404, and my outside value is 389.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of 137 is far worse than my outside offer of 389.  I should not accept it. It is also not the final round. Therefore I will make a counteroffer.  I will offer player 1 [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]. This keeps my value higher than my outside offer, and doesn't give away all items or no items.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

This is the value before the discount factor.\n\n    The discounted value is 220 * 0.9 = 198.\n\n*   **Counteroffer Evaluation:** I need to evaluate potential counteroffers, keeping in mind I have to give an amount of each item to Player 2, and compare them to my outside offer after applying the discount.\n    *   To decide on a counter offer, I will look at what Player 1 offered to Player 2 in round 1, which was \\[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], and consider if making an offer with more items will increase my chance of acceptance.

It is also less than my outside offer (Mistake 2).\n* Making counteroffer 3 gives a discounted value of 405, which is better than my outside offer of 389.\n\nSince I'm in round 2, and if I choose to make a counteroffer in the final round then it is treated as walking away, I should make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 10\n    *   Item 2: 62\n    *   Item 3: 66\n    *   Item 4: 40\n    *   Item 5: 55\n*   **Total pool of items:** There are:\n    *   3 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   4 units of item 3\n    *   4 units of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that if we reach a deal in round 2, our final value will be multiplied by 0.9, and if it reaches round 3, our final value will be multiplied by 0.9^2 = 0.81.  This encourages reaching an agreement earlier. Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't apply yet.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   I want to make an offer that is good for me but also not immediately rejected by the other player. Giving them an offer with no items would be seen as a very poor strategy (Mistake 3).\n    *   It's advantageous to consider offering half the items.\n    *   Let me consider giving 1 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5 to the other player. This means I would keep 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.  Let's calculate the value of this potential offer to me:\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 10 = 20\n        *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 62 = 62\n        *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 66 = 132\n        *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 40 = 80\n        *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 55 = 55\n        *   Total value of this counteroffer to me: 20 + 62 + 132 + 80 + 55 = 349\n    *   349 > 298, so this is greater than my outside offer.\n    \n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   I will not accept because there is no offer on the table.\n*   I will not walk away as there is potential to gain an offer better than my outside offer.\n*   I will make a counteroffer, giving 1 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 0 of item 5 to player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 2, 0]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

A good strategy is to propose an even split or very close to even. The amount of items being proposed to me in the current offer is worth 138. So I should offer to keep less than this. To find an equitable split, I could offer items that value just a bit more than what they offered me. Lets find a split that gives me just over half, lets try 176: \n    *   Item 1: 2 units  (2 * 60 = 120)\n    *   Item 2: 0 units (0 * 5 = 0)\n    *   Item 3: 3 units (3 * 29 = 87)\n    *   Item 4: 2 units (2 * 10 = 20)\n    *   Item 5: 0 units (0 * 9 = 0)\n     Total Value of offer : 120 + 0 + 87 + 20 + 0 = 227\n     So if I offer Player 1:\n     Item 1: 1 unit\n     Item 2: 1 unit\n     Item 3: 1 unit\n     Item 4: 2 units\n     Item 5: 1 unit\n     That would keep 227 for me. This is far more than my outside offer, but not as good as keeping everything.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer of 138 is significantly better than my outside offer of 102.\n    *   Keeping everything (and giving them nothing) gives me a value of 350.\n    * The counteroffer I just calculated gives me a value of 227.\n    \n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of 138 is much better than my outside option of 102, so I should not walk away from this.\n*   I also should not accept this offer, since there is a great deal of room to negotiate.\n*   I should make a counteroffer.\n*   Based on the calculations above, I will offer Player 1 the following items: \n     Item 1: 1 unit\n     Item 2: 1 unit\n     Item 3: 1 unit\n     Item 4: 2 units\n     Item 5: 1 unit.\n   This will keep 227 for me, and 123 for them.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 102.\n*   **Item values:** My values are:\n    *   Item 1: 60\n    *   Item 2: 5\n    *   Item 3: 29\n    *   Item 4: 10\n    *   Item 5: 9\n*   **Total items:** There are 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the same deal in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer gives me [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] . This means player 1 is proposing to keep 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. So, I receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 60 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 5 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 29 = 29\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 10 = 10\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 9 = 0\n    Total value = 0 + 0 + 29 + 10 + 0 = 39\n    Adjusted value = 39 * 0.9^(2-1) = 39 * 0.9 = 35.1\n\n    My adjusted value for accepting this offer is 35.1, which is less than my outside offer of 102.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me more than my outside offer (or is at least a possible deal if I am willing to walk and get my outside offer). To do so, I need to keep enough of the valuable items for myself. I could consider several counteroffers, but, given I am in round 2, I will try and make a counteroffer that provides a good value for me.\n    * Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5: [1, 0, 2, 2, 0]. This gives me:\n        * 2 units of item 1: 2 * 60 = 120\n        * 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 5 = 5\n        * 2 units of item 3: 2 * 29 = 58\n        * 2 units of item 4: 2 * 10 = 20\n        * 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 9 = 9\n        * Total value: 120 + 5 + 58 + 20 + 9 = 212\n        * Adjusted value: 212 * 0.9 = 190.8\n        This is greater than my outside option, so this is an acceptable offer for me.\n        \n        \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer (adjusted value 35.1) is worse than my outside offer (102). Therefore, I should not accept it (Mistake 4).\n*   Walking away would give me a value of 102.\n*   My counteroffer is worth 190.8 > 102, which makes it a good idea.\n\nI will make a counteroffer that gives player 1 less of each item, except for item 2 which I don't value very highly.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 2, 0]}\n```\n",

To avoid the third error, of offering nothing or all items, I will look at some possible divisions.\n    * I calculate my total value for owning all the items: (4 * 4) + (4 * 11) + (2 * 83) + (6 * 20) + (4 * 61) = 16 + 44 + 166 + 120 + 244 = 590\n        * If I offer 1 unit of each item, then I would have: 3*4 + 3*11 + 1*83 + 5*20 + 3*61 = 12 + 33 + 83 + 100 + 183 = 411\n        * If I offer 2 units of each item, then I would have: 2*4 + 2*11 + 0*83 + 4*20 + 2*61 = 8+22+0+80+122 = 232\n        * If I offer 1 unit of items 1, 2, 4 and 5 and offer 0 units of item 3 then I would have: 3*4 + 3*11 + 2*83 + 5*20 + 3*61 = 12 + 33 + 166 + 100 + 183 = 494\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI am Player 1 and this is the first round. I need to make an offer. I want to maximize my value, but I need to make it plausible that the other player would accept. I will propose an offer that leaves me a value higher than my outside offer. It might also be wise to keep more of the higher value items, while offering more of the lower value ones.\nI will offer the other player 1 unit of items 1, 2, 4 and 5, and offer 0 units of item 3, leaving myself with 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. This has a value to me of 494 which is much higher than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 221. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

My goal is to maximize my value, but I also need to be realistic to try to secure a deal. I should try to make an offer that is better for me than my outside offer, and not so bad for player 2 that it's rejected out of hand. \n    A reasonable starting point might be to offer Player 2 half of each item type (rounded up) with some minor adjustments to offer more of the items that I value less and less of the items that I value more. Specifically I will offer 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 4 units of item 5 to Player 2. This leaves me with 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.

This leaves me with 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5.\n    *   Item 1: 3 * 84 = 252\n    *   Item 2: 2 * 96 = 192\n    *   Item 3: 3 * 89 = 267\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 90 = 180\n    *   Item 5: 3 * 17 = 51\n    *   Total value: 252 + 192 + 267 + 180 + 51 = 942.\n    \nThis is still lower than my outside offer so I will try to make a different offer.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 547. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 547. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 567 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 547.\n*   **Item values:** My values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 15\n    *   Item 2: 29\n    *   Item 3: 6\n    *   Item 4: 95\n    *   Item 5: 44\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*  **Discount factor:** The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]. This means I receive:\n    * 0 units of item 1. My value = 0 * 15 = 0\n    * 0 units of item 2. My value = 0 * 29 = 0\n    * 0 units of item 3. My value = 0 * 6 = 0\n    * 0 units of item 4. My value = 0 * 95 = 0\n    * 3 units of item 5. My value = 3 * 44 = 132\n   * Total value of current offer = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 132 = 132. This is without considering the discount factor yet. \n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    The value of accepting the current offer is 132. My outside offer value is 547. Thus, the current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to formulate a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer and strategically valuable. Consider a counteroffer that gives more value to the player by dividing the items.\n    \n    Let's examine a counteroffer: if I give Player 1 [2, 1, 2, 1, 3]. It means I keep [3, 1, 3, 2, 3] for myself.\n    * 3 units of item 1: 3 * 15 = 45\n    * 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 29 = 29\n    * 3 units of item 3: 3 * 6 = 18\n    * 2 units of item 4: 2 * 95 = 190\n    * 3 units of item 5: 3 * 44 = 132\n    Total value: 45 + 29 + 18 + 190 + 132 = 414\n    This is still below my outside offer. Let's try a more aggressive counteroffer.\n\n    Let's try a counteroffer where I keep the items I value the most: [3, 1, 3, 0, 0].

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1385\n*   **My item values:** \n    *   Item 1: 84\n    *   Item 2: 96\n    *   Item 3: 89\n    *   Item 4: 90\n    *   Item 5: 17\n*   **Total items:**\n    *   Item 1: 5\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be applied to the value at the end of the round to the power (2-1) = 1\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 6 - 0 = 6\n\n    My total value for this offer:\n    *   4 * 84 + 2 * 96 + 4 * 89 + 3 * 90 + 6 * 17 = 336 + 192 + 356 + 270 + 102 = 1256\n    *   Discounted value is 1256 * 0.9 = 1130.4\n    This is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few scenarios, aiming for something better than my outside offer, adjusted for the discount. Since it's the second round, making a counter offer which is not close to my maximum will not get me to a good payoff.\n\nLet's aim to get most items that I value highly. Let's start by trying to keep all of item 2, most of item 1 and item 3, some of 4 and leave 0 of item 5:\n\n    *   Offer [1, 0, 1, 2, 6]: This means I keep:\n        *   Item 1: 5-1=4\n        *   Item 2: 2-0=2\n        *   Item 3: 5-1=4\n        *   Item 4: 3-2=1\n        *   Item 5: 6-6=0\n        \n        Total Value = 4 * 84 + 2 * 96 + 4 * 89 + 1 * 90 + 0 * 17 = 336 + 192 + 356 + 90 + 0 = 974\n        Discounted value = 974 * 0.9 = 876.6. This is bad.\n\n    *   Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]: This means I keep:\n        *   Item 1: 5-0=5\n        *   Item 2: 2-0=2\n        *   Item 3: 5-0=5\n        *   Item 4: 3-0=3\n        *   Item 5: 6-0=6\n\n        Total value = 5 * 84 + 2 * 96 + 5 * 89 + 3 * 90 + 6 * 17 = 420 + 192 + 445 + 270 + 102 = 1429\n         Discounted Value = 1429 * 0.9 = 1286.1\n         This is still not better than my outside offer, so lets try something else. \n\n   *   Let's try for a very greedy approach, and give only the items that are lowest value for me. Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 6]. This means I keep:\n         *   Item 1: 5\n         *   Item 2: 2\n         *   Item 3: 5\n         *   Item 4: 3\n         *   Item 5: 0\n    \n         Total Value = 5 * 84 + 2 * 96 + 5 * 89 + 3 * 90 + 0 * 17 = 420 + 192 + 445 + 270 + 0 = 1327\n         Discounted Value = 1327 * 0.9 = 1194.3. This is still worse than my outside offer.\n         \n   *   Let's try again but offer a bit more.  Offer [1,1,1,1,6]. This means I keep:\n         *   Item 1: 4\n         *   Item 2: 1\n         *   Item 3: 4\n         *   Item 4: 2\n         *   Item 5: 0\n   \n        Total Value = 4 * 84 + 1 * 96 + 4 * 89 + 2 * 90 + 0 * 17 = 336 + 96 + 356 + 180 = 968\n        Discounted Value = 968 * 0.9 = 871.2. This is bad.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worse than my outside offer (1130.4 < 1385).  My outside offer is still my best option right now. I have also tried some counteroffer strategies which all resulted in values less than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer on the table (1130.4 discounted value) is worse than my outside offer of 1385. None of my counteroffer attempts resulted in a better outcome, so I will walk away.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1029. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 939 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 1029.\n*   **Item values:** My values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 25\n    *   Item 2: 36\n    *   Item 3: 84\n    *   Item 4: 71\n    *   Item 5: 97\n*   **Total pool of items:** 7 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** Gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round will be worth less to me because it will be discounted by a power of 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 0, 0, 0].  This means they get 6 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 3 of item 5. This means I keep 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of keeping 6 units of item 1: 6 * 25 = 150\n    *   Value of keeping 5 units of item 2: 5 * 36 = 180\n    *   Value of keeping 4 units of item 3: 4 * 84 = 336\n    *   Value of keeping 3 units of item 4: 3 * 71 = 213\n    *   Value of keeping 3 units of item 5: 3 * 97 = 291\n    *   Total value of current offer to me: 150 + 180 + 336 + 213 + 291 = 1170\n*  **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value of 1170 is greater than my outside offer of 1029.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what a good counteroffer would look like. I want to maximize my value while making the offer attractive enough to not be rejected.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 1170. This is greater than my outside offer of 1029. If I accept this offer, I receive 1170. If I walk away, I receive 1029. Therefore, it is clearly in my interest not to walk away.\n\nI have to decide whether to accept, or make a counteroffer. If I counteroffer, I risk that the player will reject my counteroffer, and we move to round 2, where the offer will be worth 0.9 * (value of offer) for both players, thus I will be receiving a worse outcome overall.\nBecause of the discount factor, and the fact that the current offer is good for me, the best action at this stage is to accept this offer and avoid a discount.\n\nTherefore, I should accept the offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This means I would get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 7 = 7\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 83 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 49 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 1 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 75 = 75\n    *   Total value of current offer: 7 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 75 = 82\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's think about a potential counteroffer. I have:\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n    \n    I want to keep the most valuable items. Since the current offer is only worth 82, I know I'll make a counteroffer. It's very bad. Let's try offering 1 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5 to Player 1. This would leave me with the following:\n        * 3 units of Item 1 = 3 * 7 = 21\n        * 0 units of item 2 = 0\n        * 2 units of Item 3 = 2 * 49 = 98\n        * 3 units of Item 4 = 3 * 1 = 3\n        * 3 units of Item 5 = 3 * 75 = 225\n        Total Value = 21 + 0 + 98 + 3 + 225 = 347\n    This is better than my outside offer, so it will be considered if I don't think I can get a better deal.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    * The current offer (82) is much worse than my outside offer of 327.\n    * My example counteroffer (347) is better than my outside offer of 327.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer, and definitely a much worse deal. \n*   I should not accept the current offer.\n*   I should not walk away. My potential counteroffer seems better than my outside offer.\n*   I should make a counteroffer.\n\nI will make a counteroffer of giving Player 1 one of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5, leaving the rest for me, as the calculation above shows that this is better than my outside offer and is a valid offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

My previous counteroffer was also better than my outside offer so that is fine as well.\n*   Since I'm in round 2, and the last round the only option is to walk away.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on my action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 594.

This means that the value of any deal is reduced by a factor of 0.9 in round 2 and 0.9^2 in round 3. Since we are in round 1, the discount is 0.9^(1-1) = 1, meaning the discount has no effect on round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*  **Potential Counteroffers:** As Player 1, my goal is to maximize the value I receive. I need to make an offer that is good for me, but not so greedy that Player 2 will reject it. I want to explore the space of reasonable offers.\n\n    *   **Offering Player 2 all the items (0 units for me):** This would give me a value of 0 which is clearly bad.\n   \n    *   **Offering Player 2 no items (all units for me):** This is not a realistic starting point for negotiation since it is unlikely to be accepted. This can also be a mistake if it's not a final round.\n     \n    *   **Offering Player 2 a balanced amount of all items:** Let's explore dividing the items in half (rounding as necessary). If we try for a split, my offer would be offering Player 2 [1, 2, 1, 1, 2] . I keep [1, 3, 1, 2, 3]. My value is (1 * 99) + (3 * 86) + (1* 33) + (2 * 47) + (3 * 80) = 99 + 258 + 33 + 94 + 240 = 724.\n        \n    *   **Offering Player 2 a less balanced amount:** Let's offer player 2, [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This leaves me with [2, 4, 2, 3, 5]. My total value would be: (2 * 99) + (4 * 86) + (2 * 33) + (3 * 47) + (5 * 80) = 198 + 344 + 66 + 141 + 400 = 1149.\n\n*  **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The value of keeping [1, 3, 1, 2, 3] is 724, and the value of keeping [2, 4, 2, 3, 5] is 1149. Both are greater than my outside offer of 594.\n    \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer since there isn't one.\n*   I should not walk away since both plausible offers provide a value greater than my outside offer.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer. Given that this is round one and I don't want to be too greedy but still be strong, I will go with the offer that yields me a higher value (giving [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] to the other player).

Therefore, I should not accept it. I also need to consider whether I should walk or counteroffer. Walking will give me 185. I need to consider if a counteroffer will potentially get me better than 185, while accounting for the discount factor. It is round one, so I have two more rounds to make a better deal, which makes walking right now seem risky. \n\nLet's consider a counteroffer. I want to keep the items that are most valuable to me (item 2), so I will offer one of each of the less valuable items to player 1.  My counteroffer will be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].  This would leave me with 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5, which gives me a value of:\n    * 1 * 32 = 32\n    * 4 * 79 = 316\n    * 1 * 44 = 44\n    * 2 * 64 = 128\n    * 4 * 24 = 96\nTotal = 616\nThis is way more than my outside offer value.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 594\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 99\n    *   Item 2: 86\n    *   Item 3: 33\n    *   Item 4: 47\n    *   Item 5: 80\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means that any payoff I receive from an accepted offer will be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit (2-1)\n    *   Item 2: 4 units (5-1)\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit (2-1)\n    *   Item 4: 2 units (3-1)\n    *   Item 5: 4 units (5-1)\n    Value of current offer:\n    *   1 * 99 = 99\n    *   4 * 86 = 344\n    *   1 * 33 = 33\n    *   2 * 47 = 94\n    *   4 * 80 = 320\n    Total value = 99 + 344 + 33 + 94 + 320 = 890\n    Discounted value = 890 * 0.9 = 801\n*  The previous offer from Player 1 in Round 1 was [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means player 1 kept \n    *   Item 1: 2 unit\n    *   Item 2: 4 unit\n    *   Item 3: 2 unit\n    *   Item 4: 3 unit\n    *   Item 5: 5 unit\n    Value of the Round 1 offer from player 1:\n     *   2 * 99 = 198\n     *   4 * 86 = 344\n     *   2 * 33 = 66\n     *   3 * 47 = 141\n     *   5 * 80 = 400\n    Total value: 198 + 344 + 66 + 141 + 400 = 1149.\n    Discounted Value = 1149 * 0.9 = 1034.1\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to propose an offer that is worth more than 594 (my outside offer) but also likely to be accepted by Player 2. It's difficult to know what Player 2 values the items as. Let's propose an offer where we each get a fair share of the items. Let's propose giving the other player 1 of each item where possible. Therefore a counteroffer would be giving [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]. This leaves me with:\n    *  Item 1: 1 unit\n    *  Item 2: 3 unit\n    *  Item 3: 1 unit\n    *  Item 4: 2 unit\n    *  Item 5: 3 unit\n    Value of counteroffer for me = 1 * 99 + 3 * 86 + 1 * 33 + 2 * 47 + 3 * 80 = 99 + 258 + 33 + 94 + 240 = 724\n    Discounted value = 724 * 0.9 = 651.6\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer (801) is better than my outside offer (594).\n    *   The proposed counteroffer (651.6) is also better than my outside offer (594).\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n* The current offer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] is good for me.\n* My counteroffer is not as good as the current offer for me, but still better than the outside offer.\n* The offer I made in Round 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] is far worse than the current offer, meaning I will not make mistake 1.\n* The counteroffer of [1, 2, 1, 1, 2] is better than the outside offer, so I do not make mistake 2.\n* The previous round offer of [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] does give some items, so it is not mistake 3.\n* I will not accept an offer worse than my outside offer (594), so I will not make mistake 4.\n* I will not reject an offer better than my outside offer, so I will not make mistake 5.\n\nGiven that the current offer of [1,1,1,1,1] is better than my outside offer and my own potential counteroffer, I should accept it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This is the guaranteed value I get if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 71\n    *   Item 2: 58\n    *   Item 3: 91\n    *   Item 4: 41\n    *   Item 5: 95\n*   **Total Items:** There are 8 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9.  This means that any deal reached in later rounds will be worth slightly less due to the discount.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to formulate a counteroffer. I want to keep as much of the high-value items (3, 5) as possible while giving Player 2 enough to make them consider accepting a deal. My total value is 8\\*71 + 4\\*58 + 2\\*91 + 1\\*41 + 4\\*95 = 568 + 232 + 182 + 41 + 380 = 1403. Let's start with a relatively balanced offer, and see what happens, giving 3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3 and 2 of item 5. This gives a good range of items and quantity to my opponent. The remaining will come to me.\n\n    My value for this offer:\n    *Item 1: 5 * 71 = 355\n    *Item 2: 3 * 58 = 174\n    *Item 3: 1 * 91 = 91\n    *Item 4: 1 * 41 = 41\n    *Item 5: 2 * 95 = 190\n    Total: 355 + 174 + 91 + 41 + 190= 851\n    851 > 637\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Since it is round one, I should propose a counteroffer.  I won't accept an offer yet (since there is none) and it is not advantageous to walk away.  My initial offer will try to keep more of the higher value items for me.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to make a counteroffer: I will give 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3 and 2 units of item 5. This means I keep 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since this is round 1, the discount factor will be 0.9^(1-1) = 1, thus no effect this round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n    *   This means I keep:\n        *   Item 1: 8 - 3 = 5 units\n        *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n        *   Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n        *   Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n        *   Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   My Value of Current Offer:\n        *   5 * 80 = 400\n        *   3 * 20 = 60\n        *   1 * 60 = 60\n        *   1 * 31 = 31\n        *   2 * 55 = 110\n        *   Total = 400 + 60 + 60 + 31 + 110 = 661\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider potential counteroffers. If I were to offer an even split (keeping 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 2 of item 5 for myself) I would have the following:\n    * 4 * 80 = 320\n    * 2 * 20 = 40\n    * 1 * 60 = 60\n    * 0 * 31 = 0\n    * 2 * 55 = 110\n    * Total = 530\n    \n    I could also offer Player 1 only one unit of item 1 and one unit of item 5, and keep the rest of the items. This offer would have the following value for me:\n    * 7 * 80 = 560\n    * 4 * 20 = 80\n    * 2 * 60 = 120\n    * 1 * 31 = 31\n    * 3 * 55 = 165\n    * Total = 956\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n    *   The value of the current offer is 661, which is much greater than my outside offer of 275.\n    *   If I offer an even split, the value will be 530 which is also greater than the outside offer.\n    *   If I offer 1 of item 1 and 1 of item 5 to the other player, my total value is 956, which is higher than the outside offer and the current offer value.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 661, which is much higher than my outside offer of 275.\n*   I should not WALK away as the current offer is better than my outside offer.\n*   I should not ACCEPT the current offer since I can get a higher value from counteroffering.\n*   I will make a counteroffer that keeps most of the items. I'll offer one unit of item 1 and one unit of item 5 to player 1, and keep the rest of the items for myself. This offer will result in a total value of 956 for me, and leave some room for negotiation.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

This means that the value of any agreement made in later rounds is multiplied by gamma^(r-1) (where r is the round number). So, a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its face value. This incentivizes reaching a deal earlier if possible.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so I can't accept.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    I need to consider how different counteroffers would impact my total value.  My goal is to make an offer that maximizes my value (keeping in mind my outside option) while leaving enough for Player 2 to consider it. I'll calculate the value for a couple of example offers before making my final move.\n\n    Example 1: Offer Player 2 half of each item (rounding down where necessary, since we can't split units)\n        Player 2 gets: 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 1 of item 5\n        I keep: 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 1 of item 5\n        My value: 2*48 + 1*10 + 1*63 + 3*13 + 1*50 = 96 + 10 + 63 + 39 + 50 = 258\n\n    Example 2: Offer player 2 one unit of each (as applicable). \n        Player 2 gets: 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 1 of item 5\n        I keep: 3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 1 of item 5\n        My value: 3*48 + 1*10 + 1*63 + 4*13 + 1*50 = 144 + 10 + 63 + 52 + 50 = 319\n\n    Since my outside option is 124, both of these are better for me. Example 2 provides higher payoff, and giving player 2 one of each seems a good initial offer. I don't want to appear to aggressive in the first round.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I will make an offer to Player 2. Based on my analysis, offering Player 2 one unit of each item (where applicable) seems like a good starting point for negotiation. This gives me a value of 319, which is much better than my outside offer of 124. It is also not so aggressive that Player 2 will immediately reject.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

I want to maximize my benefit. I currently have 4 item 1's, 2 item 2's, 2 item 3's, 5 item 4's and 2 item 5's. I want to minimize what I give away of the highest value items, and maximize what I give away of the lowest value items. My value order is Item 5 (85), Item 3 (56), Item 1 (49), Item 2 (46), Item 4 (10).\n    *   I will try to construct a counteroffer that gives away as little as possible.\n        *   Giving away [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] would be a bad idea as it would violate mistake 3.\n        *   Giving away [4, 2, 2, 5, 2] would be a bad idea as it would violate mistake 3.\n        *   My current items are worth 4*49 + 2*46 + 2*56 + 5*10 + 2*85 = 196 + 92 + 112 + 50 + 170 = 620.\n        *   A counteroffer of [1,0,0,0,0] gives me 3*49 + 2*46 + 2*56 + 5*10 + 2*85 = 147 + 92 + 112 + 50 + 170 = 571, which is greater than my outside offer.\n    *   Let's try a counter offer giving more away:\n        *   A counteroffer of [1,1,1,1,0] gives me: 3*49 + 1*46 + 1*56 + 4*10 + 2*85 = 147 + 46 + 56 + 40 + 170 = 459.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If the deal is in round 3, it will be multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4-1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 2-0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 2-0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 5-0 = 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 2-0 = 2 units\n    \n    My value if I accept the current offer is:\n    (3 * 48) + (2 * 10) + (2 * 63) + (5 * 13) + (2 * 50) = 144 + 20 + 126 + 65 + 100 = 455\n    However, this is discounted by gamma since it is round 2.\n    Discounted Value: 455 * 0.9 = 409.5\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to propose something that is better than my outside offer of 124 to benefit from negotiations. I need to also take into account that I cannot propose an offer that I am giving away everything or nothing to Player 2.\n    I would prefer to get more of items 3 and 5 since they have high values. The previous offers were giving away less of the items. So let's try an offer that is balanced between my values and giving items to player 2. I will offer the player: [0, 1, 1, 2, 1].

We must avoid mistakes, especially not offering less than our outside option, or offering nothing. A balanced approach is probably best for round one.\n\nLet's start by seeing what a 50/50 split would look like, offering half to Player 2, and keeping half for myself, rounding down where necessary:\n\n* Offer to Player 2: 2 item 1, 1 item 2, 1 item 3, 1 item 4, 2 item 5.\n\nThis means we keep: 2 item 1, 2 item 2, 2 item 3, 1 item 4, 3 item 5\n\nThe value for us would be:\n2 * 95 + 2 * 22 + 2 * 12 + 1 * 7 + 3 * 8 = 190 + 44 + 24 + 7 + 24 = 289\n\nThis is far more than our outside option of 116, and should give Player 2 a good starting point.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 604. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 816 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 604.\n*   **Item values:** My values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 53\n    *   Item 2: 82\n    *   Item 3: 63\n    *   Item 4: 22\n    *   Item 5: 52\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*  **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that the value of any deal in round 2 will be 0.9 times the undiscounted value, and in round 3 will be 0.81 times the undiscounted value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    The value of this offer to me is:\n    (2 * 53) + (2 * 82) + (2 * 63) + (1 * 22) + (3 * 52) = 106 + 164 + 126 + 22 + 156 = 574.\n    Since 574 is less than my outside offer of 604, I should not accept this offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what a good counteroffer would be. I should try to get a value greater than 604. Let's analyze some options to keep as much as possible. I can also propose an offer that is favorable to me in terms of the items that I value more:\n    * Option 1: I offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1. This means I keep [3, 3, 3, 2, 5]. My value is: (3 * 53) + (3 * 82) + (3 * 63) + (2 * 22) + (5 * 52) = 159 + 246 + 189 + 44 + 260 = 898. This is great for me, much higher than 604.\n    * Option 2: I offer [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] to Player 1. This means I keep [3, 3, 2, 1, 5]. My value is: (3 * 53) + (3 * 82) + (2 * 63) + (1 * 22) + (5 * 52) = 159 + 246 + 126 + 22 + 260 = 813.\n    * Option 3: I offer [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1. This means I keep [4, 2, 2, 1, 4]. My value is: (4 * 53) + (2 * 82) + (2 * 63) + (1 * 22) + (4 * 52) = 212 + 164 + 126 + 22 + 208 = 732.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n* The current offer is worse than my outside option (574 < 604), so I will not accept it.\n* I will not walk away, as I can certainly make a counter offer that is greater than my outside offer value.\n* I'll propose counteroffer 1, offering [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1, which yields a value of 898 for myself.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This means I get:\n    * 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 53 = 53\n    * 0 units of item 2: 0 * 82 = 0\n    * 0 units of item 3: 0 * 63 = 0\n    * 0 units of item 4: 0 * 22 = 0\n    * 0 units of item 5: 0 * 52 = 0\n    * Total value of current offer: 53\n    * Discounted value of current offer: 53 * 0.9 = 47.7\n    This is much lower than my outside offer of 604, making it a terrible offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** \n    * Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep at least half the items that Player 1 keeps:\n        * Offer [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]:  My values would be (2 * 53) + (2 * 82) + (2 * 63) + (1 * 22) + (3 * 52) = 106 + 164 + 126 + 22 + 156 = 574.  Discounted value = 574 * 0.9 = 516.6 . This is still worse than my outside offer.\n        * Offer [2,1,1,0,0] My values would be (2 * 53) + (2 * 82) + (2 * 63) + (2 * 22) + (5 * 52) = 106 + 164 + 126 + 0 + 0 = 396. Discounted value = 396 * 0.9 = 356.4. Again, this is worse than my outside offer.\n        * Let's try [1,0,0,0,0] which is the inverse of the current offer.  My values would be (3 * 53) + (3 * 82) + (3 * 63) + (2 * 22) + (5 * 52) = 159 + 246 + 189 + 44 + 260 = 898.  Discounted value = 898 * 0.9 = 808.2. This is better than my outside offer.\n        * How about I keep all items? [0,0,0,0,0]. My values would be (4 * 53) + (3 * 82) + (3 * 63) + (2 * 22) + (5 * 52) = 212 + 246 + 189 + 44 + 260 = 951. Discounted value = 951 * 0.9 = 855.9. This is also better than my outside offer.\n        * Let's see what happens if we keep most items and keep at least one of each item for myself: [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]. My value would be (3 * 53) + (2 * 82) + (2 * 63) + (2 * 22) + (4 * 52) = 159 + 164 + 126 + 0 + 208 = 657. Discounted value = 657 * .9 = 591.3, worse than outside offer.\n        * Let's try a counteroffer giving player 1 something they did not previously receive:[0,1,1,1,1]. My values would be (4 * 53) + (2 * 82) + (2 * 63) + (1 * 22) + (4 * 52) = 212 + 164 + 126 + 22 + 208 = 732. Discounted value = 732 * .9 = 658.8, better than my outside offer.\n        * How about offering half of each item to the other player? [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]. My value would be (2 * 53) + (2 * 82) + (2 * 63) + (1 * 22) + (3 * 52) = 106 + 164 + 126 + 22 + 156 = 574. Discounted value 574*.9 = 516.6. Worse than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] has a discounted value of 47.7, which is much worse than my outside offer of 604. Therefore, I will not accept this.\n*   I will make a counteroffer which is better than my outside offer. I see that [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] and [0,0,0,0,0] both produce values better than my outside offer. I will make a counteroffer and not give player one everything.\n*   I'll offer [0,1,1,1,1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

The goal here is to offer player 2 something that is reasonable enough to keep them at the table and to leave me with something that is better than my outside option.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 230.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 46\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 90\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 34\n*   **Total pool of items:** 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds will be worth less than accepting the same offer earlier.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 46 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 4 = 4\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 90 = 270\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 2 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 34 = 68\n    *   Total value of current offer: 0 + 4 + 270 + 0 + 68 = 342\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider the total value of various counteroffers I could make. I need to compare the value that I would get from those counteroffers to my outside offer of 230 and the current offer of 342. Let me consider a range of counteroffers. Since it is the first round, I should not give away too much. I want to keep most of the items I value the most, that is item 3 and item 5. I will try to make an offer that leaves my total value higher than my outside offer, which is 230.\n    *   Offer 1 to player 1: [0, 2, 4, 0, 3]: This would mean I get [2,2,3,2,2]\n        *  2 * 46 + 2*4 + 3*90 + 2*2 + 2*34 = 92 + 8 + 270 + 4 + 68 = 442\n    *   Offer 2 to player 1: [0, 2, 3, 0, 2]: This would mean I get [2,2,4,2,3]\n         * 2*46 + 2*4 + 4*90 + 2*2 + 3*34 = 92+ 8+ 360+4+102 = 566\n   *   Offer 3 to player 1: [0, 3, 5, 1, 4]: This means I get [2,1,2,1,1]\n       * 2*46 + 1*4 + 2*90+1*2+1*34 = 92 +4+180+2+34 = 312\n    \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    * The current offer from Player 1 is worth 342 to me, which is greater than my outside offer of 230.\n    *  Offer 1 would give me a value of 442 which is better than my outside offer.\n    *  Offer 2 would give me a value of 566 which is better than my outside offer and also better than offer 1.\n    *  Offer 3 would give me a value of 312 which is better than my outside offer. \n    \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of 342 is better than my outside offer of 230, so I will not WALK.\n*   Since it's the first round, I want to make a counteroffer that maximizes my value.\n*   Since Offer 2 results in the highest total value for me, it would be a good counteroffer to try first.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 3, 0, 2]}\n```\n",

This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 7 - 2 = 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    The value of this offer to me is:\n    (2 * 46) + (3 * 4) + (5 * 90) + (2 * 2) + (4 * 34) = 92 + 12 + 450 + 4 + 136 = 694.\n    With the discount factor, this is 694 * 0.9 = 624.6\n\n    This value 624.6 is significantly higher than my outside option of 230.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider my best possible counteroffer, and see if there's value in making a better offer. Because there is one round left after this round, I can make a better offer than previously and hope to get that accepted.\n\n    My previous offer was [0, 2, 3, 0, 2]. If I was to keep as much value as possible I would keep items 3 and 5.\n    For example: If I offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0], I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 7 - 1 = 6 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 0 = 5 units\n    This would be a value of (2 * 46) + (3 * 4) + (6 * 90) + (2 * 2) + (5 * 34) = 92 + 12 + 540 + 4 + 170 = 818.  With the discount factor, this is 818 * 0.9 = 736.2. This is a better outcome than the current offer.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is 230. The current offer is worth 624.6, so accepting it would be much better than walking away. However, I might be able to get an even better offer if I make a counter offer this round.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of 624.6 is much higher than my outside offer of 230. So I should not walk away. I have calculated that I can make a counteroffer that is better than the current offer. Therefore I will make a counteroffer.\n\nI will make the counteroffer [0, 1, 1, 0, 0] as above, giving the player only 1 unit of item 2 and item 3.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 172\n*   **My item values:** \n    *   Item 1: 14\n    *   Item 2: 55\n    *   Item 3: 77\n    *   Item 4: 96\n    *   Item 5: 47\n*   **Total items available:** \n    *   Item 1: 7\n    *   Item 2: 3\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 10\n    *   Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  This means that if the negotiation goes to round 2, the value of any agreement will be multiplied by 0.9, and round 3, by 0.9^2 = 0.81. This gives a clear incentive to make a deal sooner.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offered me [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This means I receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 14 = 14\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 55 = 55\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 77 = 77\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 96 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 47 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 14 + 55 + 77 + 0 + 0 = 146\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (146) is worse than my outside offer (172).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to formulate a counteroffer that I believe the other player might accept and that is also better than my outside offer. Let's calculate some potential counteroffers and my resulting values (note that these values assume the agreement is in round 1, so there is no discounting). I will assume that I keep at least 1 unit of every item I value highly. I am Player 2. Here are a few examples of what I keep, the offer that I send out, and the total value to me:\n  * Keep [6,2,3,9,4] : value to me is 6*14 + 2*55 + 3*77+9*96 + 4*47= 1480. Offer to P1: [1,1,1,1,1] (1 unit of each item).\n   *  Keep [5, 1, 2, 8, 3] : Value to me is 5*14+1*55+2*77+8*96+3*47=1322.  Offer to P1: [2,2,2,2,2]\n   *   Keep [4,0,1,7,2] : Value to me is 4*14+0*55+1*77+7*96+2*47= 863. Offer to P1: [3,3,3,3,3]\n   *   Keep [3,0,0,6,1] : Value to me is 3*14+0*55+0*77+6*96+1*47=667. Offer to P1: [4,3,4,4,4].\n    *Keep [6,1,3,9,4] : value to me is 6*14 + 1*55 + 3*77+9*96 + 4*47= 1425. Offer to P1: [1,2,1,1,1] (1 unit of each item)\nI need to calculate what I keep, not what I offer, to see if it's better than my outside offer. I will aim to keep the most valuable items and get a payoff above my outside offer. It's also important that I don't offer Player 1 nothing, and aim for them to get a good amount of items (since they must also see value in it, in order to accept). \n\nBased on my item values, I should try to keep as many of items 4 and 3 as possible, then item 2, 5 and finally 1.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 146 to me, which is lower than my outside offer of 172, so I should not ACCEPT.\n*   Walking away is an option since the offer is lower, but since it's still the first round, I should propose a counteroffer and see if they accept.\n*   Let's propose a counteroffer that gives Player 1 some items but also ensures I keep enough to be above my outside offer. I will keep 6 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 9 of item 4, and 4 of item 5. That gives me 6*14+1*55+3*77+9*96+4*47=1425 (well above my outside offer). Then I will give Player 1 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5. This way, they also get at least 1 item of each kind, and hopefully, will also see the value in this offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer of [1,2,1,1,1] to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

The value of any outcome in a future round is reduced by this factor. Since this is round 2, any deal is now worth 0.9 * value of items.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer (from Player 2):**  [1, 2, 1, 1, 1] is the amount offered to me. This means Player 2 is asking to keep:\n    *   Item 1: 7 - 1 = 6 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 10 - 1 = 9 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4 units\nMy value of this offer (before discount) is:\n    *   1 * 2  (item 1) + 2 * 25 (item 2) + 1 * 19 (item 3) + 1 * 48 (item 4) + 1 * 98 (item 5) = 2 + 50 + 19 + 48 + 98 = 217.\n\nMy value after discount for round 2 = 217 * 0.9^(2-1) = 217 * 0.9 = 195.3\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that provide me with a value greater than 967 (my outside offer) *after discounting*. Let's evaluate the previous offer I made, which gave [1,1,1,0,0] to Player 2. This would leave me with [6,2,3,10,5]. The value to me of this would be 6*2 + 2*25 + 3*19 + 10*48 + 5*98 = 12 + 50 + 57 + 480 + 490 = 1089. With the discount factor it's worth 1089 * 0.9 = 980.1\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** My outside offer value is 967. The current offer (195.3) is significantly worse than my outside offer. My previous offer after discounting is 980.1\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible for me: 195.3 compared to 967. Accepting would be a mistake.  \nMy previous counteroffer had a discounted value of 980.1, which is better than my outside offer of 967.

This means I would get:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit * 14 = 14\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit * 55 = 55\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit * 77 = 77\n    *   Item 4: 0 unit * 96 = 0\n    *   Item 5: 0 unit * 47 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 14 + 55 + 77 + 0 + 0 = 146\n    *   Discounted value of the current offer: 146 * 0.9 = 131.4\n    *   Since 131.4 < 172, accepting the current offer would violate mistake #4.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   Before considering specific counteroffers, I need to calculate the total value of all the items to me:\n        *   Item 1: 7 * 14 = 98\n        *   Item 2: 3 * 55 = 165\n        *   Item 3: 4 * 77 = 308\n        *   Item 4: 10 * 96 = 960\n        *   Item 5: 5 * 47 = 235\n        *   Total Value: 98 + 165 + 308 + 960 + 235 = 1766\n    *   My previous counteroffer in Round 1 was [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]. The items I keep are [6, 1, 3, 9, 4].  The value for that would be 6*14 + 1*55 + 3*77 + 9*96 + 4*47 = 84 + 55 + 231 + 864 + 188 = 1422.  The discounted value of that offer is 1422 * 0.9^0 = 1422\n    *   The current offer on the table to Player 1 is a copy of their original offer in round 1, namely [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This suggest that they may be unwilling to budge. I would like to make an offer to capture more value than my outside offer value. Let's try offering them something close to the other player's initial offer in order to see how they would react.\n\nLet's try a counter offer of [1,1,1,1,1]. This means I keep [6, 2, 3, 9, 4].\nThe value to me is 6 * 14 + 2 * 55 + 3 * 77 + 9 * 96 + 4 * 47 = 84 + 110 + 231 + 864 + 188 = 1477.\nSince this is round 2, if this offer is accepted, I will receive 0.9*1477 = 1329.3. This is much greater than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 131.4, which is worse than my outside offer of 172. So I should NOT ACCEPT it.\n*   I will make a counteroffer that is still better than my outside offer. Since it is round 2, I am not punished too much for making another offer.\n*   I will make a counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to test if the other player will budge, and to try to capture as much value as possible.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 292\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 29\n    *   Item 2: 60\n    *   Item 3: 13\n    *   Item 4: 6\n    *   Item 5: 57\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 7 units\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal made in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the nominal value, and in round 3, it is worth 0.9^2 times the nominal value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 0, 3, 1, 1] (meaning they are offering to give me 3 units of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5). Let's calculate its value to me:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 29 = 87\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 60 = 0\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 13 = 39\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 6 = 6\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 57 = 57\n    *   Total value of current offer: 87 + 0 + 39 + 6 + 57 = 189\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 189, which is *less* than my outside offer of 292. Accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse than your outside offer).\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider how a counteroffer could benefit me. Since this is Round 1, there is a significant incentive to make a good deal. If I walk now, I get 292, but if we settle on a fair deal, we could both be better off given our potential combined total value from the items. The maximum possible value to me is:\n    *   6 units of item 1: 6 * 29 = 174\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 60 = 180\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 13 = 39\n    *   7 units of item 4: 7 * 6 = 42\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 57 = 57\n    *   Total value: 174 + 180 + 39 + 42 + 57 = 492\n    Given this, I should be aiming to get at least a deal that gives me the value of 292 (my outside offer).\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that gives me more than 292. I will try to take all item 5, all of items 2, most of item 1 and see what happens. This would mean offering [0,0,0,0,0] as a counter offer. My value in this case would be 492, which is good. I will not offer them everything, to avoid mistake 3.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of 189 is less than my outside offer of 292, so I should not accept it.\n*   I will not walk away since there is opportunity for negotiation. \n*   I should propose a counteroffer that gives me at least my outside offer value.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

To avoid a situation where I walk away with my outside offer, I will make a counteroffer that gives player 2 only a small amount of item 4. This item is the most valuable item to me, so it would give the opponent the most value. It would be strategic to offer an amount of items that would be less beneficial for me to walk away from. To do this, I will offer to give 2 units of item 4 to player 2.\n\nMy counteroffer will then be [0, 0, 0, 2, 0] to player 2, which means that I keep 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My value for this outcome is (6 * 6) + (3 * 25) + (3 * 5) + (5 * 60) + (1 * 3) = 36 + 75 + 15 + 300 + 3 = 429.

The second counteroffer with a discounted value of 345.6 is also higher than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is not acceptable.\n*   Walking away is also not optimal since I could potentially secure a better offer than my outside offer.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer. The counteroffer of giving Player 1 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, and 1 of item 4 seems to be optimal given the constraint that I cannot make an offer that is worse than my previous offer (mistake 1).\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

The last offer for Player 1 was better for them than their first. Let's offer less than they asked for, but more than the counteroffer I made in Round 1 to see if that gets us a final agreement. We also have to be mindful of mistake 1, and ensure this next offer is better than our last.\n    I will calculate a few potential counter offers and then decide which one to use.\n    *   Potential Counteroffer 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Keeping [4, 2, 5, 3, 3]. Value is (4*34) + (2*51) + (5*48) + (3*96) + (3*11) = 136 + 102 + 240 + 288 + 33 = 799. Discounted value is 799 * 0.9 = 719.1\n    *   Potential Counteroffer 2: [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Keeping [4, 3, 5, 4, 4]. Value is (4*34) + (3*51) + (5*48) + (4*96) + (4*11) = 136+153+240+384+44= 957. Discounted value is 957 * 0.9 = 861.3\n    *   Potential Counteroffer 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Keeping [5, 3, 6, 4, 4]. Value is (5*34) + (3*51) + (6*48) + (4*96) + (4*11) = 170+153+288+384+44= 1039. Discounted value is 1039*0.9 = 935.1\n    *  Potential Counteroffer 4: [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]. Keeping [3, 2, 4, 3, 3]. Value is (3*34) + (2*51) + (4*48) + (3*96) + (3*11) = 102 + 102 + 192 + 288 + 33 = 717. Discounted value is 717 * 0.9 = 645.3\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (675.9) is lower than my outside offer (793), so accepting the offer is mistake 4. Potential counter offer 1 (719.1) is less than the outside offer. Potential counter offer 2 (861.3) is better than the outside offer, so it is worth trying to negotiate that. Potential counter offer 3 (935.1) is also better than the outside offer and is the maximum value to me, so it is worth trying to negotiate that if possible. Potential counter offer 4 (645.3) is not better than the outside offer, and is worse than all of our past values so it is not a sensible option.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is not as good as my outside offer, so I should not accept.\n*   Offering [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] or [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is a better outcome than my outside offer, so it is worth trying to negotiate one of these offers. I will try a counter offer that gives more than my previous one, but is still better than the outside offer, in order to avoid a walk.\n*   Offering [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] is a reasonable strategy, since it is an improvement on the previous offer and has a high value to me. It is also more likely to be accepted than [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n**Action:**\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 284. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 804 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 438. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 636 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 438\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 15\n    *   Item 2: 23\n    *   Item 3: 14\n    *   Item 4: 64\n    *   Item 5: 96\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4\n    *   Item 2: 1\n    *   Item 3: 7\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting it in the current round. Specifically, accepting in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value, and in round 3, 0.81 times the value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so there is nothing to accept.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer. I need to make sure the value of my offer (what I keep) is greater than my outside offer value of 438. I also need to make sure that I am not offering nothing or everything at the initial round. Also, a strategic opening offer is usually more generous to leave room for negotiations later.\n\nLet's evaluate some potential offers and the values for me (what I keep).\n\n*   **Offer 1:** Giving Player 2 1 of each item, so keeping:\n    *   Item 1: 3 units * 15 = 45\n    *   Item 2: 0 units * 23 = 0\n    *   Item 3: 6 units * 14 = 84\n    *   Item 4: 2 units * 64 = 128\n    *   Item 5: 2 units * 96 = 192\n    *   Total: 449\n*   **Offer 2:** Giving Player 2 2 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 1 of item 5. Keeping:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units * 15 = 30\n    *   Item 2: 1 units * 23 = 23\n    *   Item 3: 4 units * 14 = 56\n    *   Item 4: 2 units * 64 = 128\n    *   Item 5: 2 units * 96 = 192\n    *   Total: 429\n*   **Offer 3:** Giving Player 2 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 0 of item 5. Keeping:\n    *   Item 1: 4 units * 15 = 60\n    *   Item 2: 1 units * 23 = 23\n    *   Item 3: 7 units * 14 = 98\n    *   Item 4: 3 units * 64 = 192\n    *   Item 5: 3 units * 96 = 288\n    *   Total: 661\n\nSince offer 1 gives me the highest value, of 449, which is larger than my outside offer value of 438 and also is strategically advantageous as a first offer, I will choose to make that offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nI will make a counteroffer that proposes giving Player 2 1 unit of each item (if there is at least one available).\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step and determine the best course of action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 319. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 20 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 40 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 8 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 22 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 68 per unit\n*   **Total Item Pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 7 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer later in the game is worth less than accepting an identical offer earlier in the game. Specifically, a deal in round 2 would be worth 0.9 times the initial value, and in round 3 it would be worth 0.81 times the initial value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer Value:** The current offer is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], meaning I would receive 1 unit of each item.\n    *   Value of Item 1: 1 * 20 = 20\n    *   Value of Item 2: 1 * 40 = 40\n    *   Value of Item 3: 1 * 8 = 8\n    *   Value of Item 4: 1 * 22 = 22\n    *   Value of Item 5: 1 * 68 = 68\n    *   Total value of current offer = 20 + 40 + 8 + 22 + 68 = 158\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** My total value from the current offer (158) is much lower than my outside offer (319). Therefore, accepting the current offer is not a good option at this point.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider making a counteroffer.  I have to keep in mind my goal, which is to maximize my total value of the outcome of the negotiation game, and that I should at least have value equal to or more than my outside offer. I will calculate the value if I kept all items. I would receive the following:\n    *   Value of Item 1: 4 * 20 = 80\n    *   Value of Item 2: 1 * 40 = 40\n    *   Value of Item 3: 7 * 8 = 56\n    *   Value of Item 4: 3 * 22 = 66\n    *   Value of Item 5: 3 * 68 = 204\n    *   Total value of keeping all items = 80 + 40 + 56 + 66 + 204 = 446. I need to offer some of the items to Player 1 to reach an agreement.\n    *   I'll consider a counteroffer that gives player 1 some value, but still keeps my value over my outside option. I'll also try to avoid the suboptimal move of offering all of one item type.  I will propose a counteroffer of [1, 0, 3, 1, 1]. If I offer this to player 1, I get to keep [3,1,4,2,2]\n    * Value of Item 1: 3 * 20 = 60\n    * Value of Item 2: 1 * 40 = 40\n    * Value of Item 3: 4 * 8 = 32\n    * Value of Item 4: 2 * 22 = 44\n    * Value of Item 5: 2 * 68 = 136\n    * Total value of proposed offer = 60+40+32+44+136 = 312\n\nThis is less than my outside option, which means this is a bad offer. Instead, I will keep 3 units of item 1, all of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5, and I will offer player 1 the remaining items. This means I am offering [1, 0, 3, 1, 1].\n    *   Value of Item 1: 3 * 20 = 60\n    *   Value of Item 2: 1 * 40 = 40\n    *   Value of Item 3: 4 * 8 = 32\n    *   Value of Item 4: 2 * 22 = 44\n    *   Value of Item 5: 2 * 68 = 136\n    *   Total value of keeping these items= 60+40+32+44+136 = 312\n    \nI should keep a more substantial portion of item 5 since it is my most valuable item. I will now propose [1,0,4,2,0]. This means I get [3, 1, 3, 1, 3]. The total value for me with this allocation is 362.\n    *   Value of Item 1: 3 * 20 = 60\n    *   Value of Item 2: 1 * 40 = 40\n    *   Value of Item 3: 3 * 8 = 24\n    *   Value of Item 4: 1 * 22 = 22\n    *   Value of Item 5: 3 * 68 = 204\n    *   Total value of keeping these items= 60+40+24+22+204 = 350\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   **Accept Current Offer?** No, the current offer is far below my outside option of 319.\n*   **Walk Away?** No, I can likely do better than my outside offer if I counteroffer.\n*   **Counteroffer:** Yes. I will make the counteroffer of [1, 0, 4, 2, 0]. This means I keep [3, 1, 3, 1, 3] and get a total value of 350 which is greater than my outside option, avoids offering all of one item type, and doesn't offer nothing.\n    \n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 4, 2, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 438. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 15, Item 2: 23, Item 3: 14, Item 4: 64, Item 5: 96.\n*   **Total item pool:** 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we're in round 2, any deal we make now will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means a deal in round 2 will be worth 90% of the same deal in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 4, 2, 0]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 units * 15 = 45\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1 unit * 23 = 23\n    *   Item 3: 7 - 4 = 3 units * 14 = 42\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 2 = 1 unit * 64 = 64\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 0 = 3 units * 96 = 288\n    *   Total value = 45 + 23 + 42 + 64 + 288 = 462\n    *   Adjusted value (round 2) = 462 * 0.9 = 415.8\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (415.8) is *less* than my outside offer value (438).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value higher than my outside offer (and hopefully higher than what the current offer would give me discounted, and also hope that Player 2 does not walk away). I also have to account for the discount factor.\n    * I will not consider giving my opponent everything, or nothing at all, as that is Mistake 3.\n    * Let's consider an offer that would provide me with all of item 5 and most of the item 4 and some of the item 3. Perhaps offering them 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  This would mean I would keep:\n        * Item 1: 3 units * 15 = 45\n        * Item 2: 1 unit * 23 = 23\n        * Item 3: 4 units * 14 = 56\n        * Item 4: 2 unit * 64 = 128\n        * Item 5: 3 unit * 96 = 288\n        * Total value = 45 + 23 + 56 + 128 + 288 = 540\n    *   Adjusted value (round 2) = 540 * 0.9 = 486 which is greater than 438\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer. Accepting it would be Mistake 4.\n*   I will not accept the current offer.\n*   I will make the counteroffer of [1, 0, 3, 1, 0] to Player 2 since its value is greater than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 3, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

Specifically, an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value and an offer in round 3 is worth 0.81 the value. Since we are in round 1, there is no discount yet.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what offer would be acceptable and beneficial for me. To begin, let's evaluate a few simple offers.\n    * Keeping all items: \n        * 2*45 + 3*33 + 4*23 + 3*9 + 5*50 = 90 + 99 + 92 + 27 + 250 = 558. This is significantly higher than my outside offer.\n        * Giving away nothing is also likely to result in a WALK from player 2 so it's not a good option.\n    * Giving Player 2 one unit of each item:\n        * Keeping 1 item 1, 2 item 2, 3 item 3, 2 item 4, 4 item 5 gives a value of 1*45 + 2*33 + 3*23 + 2*9 + 4*50 = 45+66+69+18+200 = 398.\n        * This also leaves Player 2 with 1 unit of each item. \n    * Giving Player 2 half the items:\n         * Because the quantities of items are not even across all items I cannot split them in half exactly.\n         * Giving Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5: This leaves me with 1 item 1, 2 item 2, 2 item 3, 2 item 4 and 3 item 5. Total value = 1*45 + 2*33 + 2*23 + 2*9 + 3*50 = 45 + 66 + 46 + 18 + 150 = 325\n        * This offer has a value lower than my outside offer and would be a mistake.\n    * Giving Player 2 one unit of items 1 and 2 and two units of items 3, 4 and 5.\n         * This would leave me with one item 1, two item 2, 2 item 3, 1 item 4, and 3 item 5 with a value of: 1*45 + 2*33 + 2*23 + 1*9 + 3*50 = 45 + 66 + 46 + 9 + 150 = 316. This is also worse than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer, because there isn't any.\n*   I should not walk away, as I can still make a deal that is better than my outside offer.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer that gives some items to player 2 to avoid a walk, but also gives me a large value.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 406. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 618 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 2 - 1 = 1 unit, worth 1 * 40 = 40\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units, worth 2 * 93 = 186\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3 units, worth 3 * 2 = 6\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units, worth 2 * 2 = 4\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4 units, worth 4 * 69 = 276\n    *   Total value of current offer: 40 + 186 + 6 + 4 + 276 = 512\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider the value of different counteroffers. I will consider an offer where I keep 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5 and counter with what i am offering Player 1, [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 40 = 40\n    *   Item 2: 2 * 93 = 186\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 2 = 4\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 2 = 4\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 69 = 276\n    *   Total value: 510\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Current Offer: 512 > 406 (my outside offer). Accepting the current offer is better than walking away now.\n    *   Counter offer: 510 > 406 (my outside offer). The counter offer is better than walking away now.\n   \n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of 512 is greater than my outside offer of 406. Thus, it makes sense to pursue it, however it could be possible to get a better offer for myself with a counter offer, 510 is only slightly less than 512.\n I will make a counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Since we are in round 2, any deal made this round will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I receive 0 units of each item. This gives me a value of 0.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that's better than my outside offer when accounting for the discount factor.\n    *   Let's consider keeping all the items for myself. My value would be (2 * 40) + (3 * 93) + (4 * 2) + (3 * 2) + (5 * 69) = 80 + 279 + 8 + 6 + 345 = 718. This would be discounted by 0.9 in this round, giving me a value of 718 * 0.9 = 646.2\n    *   Let's consider offering [1,1,2,1,2] to Player 1. This leaves me with [1,2,2,2,3]. The value of this for me is (1*40) + (2*93) + (2*2) + (2*2) + (3*69) = 40 + 186 + 4 + 4 + 207 = 431. Discounted by 0.9 = 387.9\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] gives me a value of 0, which is less than my outside offer of 406. Thus, I should not ACCEPT this.\n*   Offering [1,1,2,1,2] would give me a value of 387.9 which is less than my outside offer of 406, making it worse than my outside offer and is therefore not a good idea.\n*   My outside offer is 406. If I keep all the items, I get 646.2 in this round (718 *0.9), which is better.\n*   It seems that any valid offer that is better than my outside offer would involve keeping more items for myself than the ones proposed in the history of the negotiation.\n\nGiven this, I will make a counteroffer that gives the other player a minimal amount of items that isn't 0. Since I have 2 units of item 1 and 5 units of item 5 which have higher values for me, I want to keep as many of them as possible. My counteroffer will be [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This gives player 1 a small token amount of items, while I still get significant value.\n\n**My Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Offer 3 seems to be good in that I keep the highest valued items and give the other player the lowest valued items, and also has a higher value than the other considered offers. Offering half the items isn't great because some items are worth more to me than others and the other player could accept this offer and it's not optimal for me.\n\nTherefore, I will make offer 3.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an outcome in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its undiscounted value, and an outcome in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 times its undiscounted value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I receive 1 unit of item 3.\n    *   My value for this offer: 1 * 9 = 9\n    *   Since 9 < 30 (my outside offer), this offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider the value of different potential divisions. I have to ensure that any counter offer does not put me in a worse position than my outside offer, which is 30.\n    * Let's consider the best possible outcome which is retaining all items.\n        *   5 units of item 1 = 5 * 78 = 390\n        *   4 units of item 2 = 4 * 97 = 388\n        *   6 units of item 3 = 6 * 9 = 54 (I have 7 total, I must give one away to not give away all)\n        *   2 units of item 4 = 2 * 19 = 38\n        *   6 units of item 5 = 6 * 3 = 18\n        *   Total value (best case) = 888\n\n    * Let's consider a more reasonable counteroffer, offering Player 1 1 unit of item 3, and keeping the rest:\n         *  5 units of item 1 = 5 * 78 = 390\n         *  4 units of item 2 = 4 * 97 = 388\n         *  6 units of item 3 = 6 * 9 = 54\n         *  2 units of item 4 = 2 * 19 = 38\n         *  6 units of item 5 = 6 * 3 = 18\n        *   Total value: 888. This is much better than my outside offer and the current offer.\n         \n    * Let's consider offering 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5 to player 1:\n         * 4 units of item 1 = 4 * 78 = 312\n         * 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 97 = 291\n         * 6 units of item 3 = 6 * 9 = 54\n         * 1 units of item 4 = 1 * 19 = 19\n         * 5 units of item 5 = 5 * 3 = 15\n        *  Total value: 691, this is also better than my outside offer of 30.\n         \n    * It is important not to offer all items of a single type to the other player. For instance offering all 7 units of item 3 would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Comparison to my outside offer:**\n    *   Accepting the current offer (value 9) is worse than my outside offer (value 30).\n    *  A potential counteroffer where I only give 1 item is very good and is much better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer because it is worse than my outside offer. (Mistake 4).\n*   I should not walk away as there are better possible outcomes. (Mistake 5).\n*   I should make a counteroffer, because doing so could lead to a better outcome than my outside offer.\n*   I'll choose to make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 1 unit of item 3, leaving me with 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine my optimal action for round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 892\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 74\n    *   Item 2: 6\n    *   Item 3: 62\n    *   Item 4: 72\n    *   Item 5: 21\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 13 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that receiving a value in a later round is worth less than receiving that value now.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so I cannot evaluate accepting anything yet.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   I need to propose a counteroffer in this round, since I can not accept an existing offer. I need to think of a sensible first counteroffer, which gives Player 2 something but keeps me with sufficient value.\n    *  A simple starting approach is to divide the items roughly in half, and make a counter offer where I offer Player 2 half of everything rounded to the nearest integer. I will calculate my value if I offer them the following:\n        *   Item 1: 1 unit\n        *   Item 2: 2 units\n        *   Item 3: 7 units\n        *   Item 4: 3 units\n        *   Item 5: 3 units\n       \n    * Calculating my value if I keep the remainder:\n        *  Item 1: 1 * 74 = 74\n        *  Item 2: 2 * 6 = 12\n        *  Item 3: 6 * 62 = 372\n        *  Item 4: 2 * 72 = 144\n        *  Item 5: 3 * 21 = 63\n        *  Total value: 74 + 12 + 372 + 144 + 63 = 665\n\n      My total value from this division would be 665.\n      If I walk I get a guaranteed value of 892.\n      \n     As this negotiation is in round 1, and there is still the potential to gain a better outcome by negotiating, it's worth trying to propose an offer, and seeing how Player 2 reacts.\n      \n    *   I should only propose an offer if it is above 0, and not all items, as this would be a suboptimal play in round 1.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Since there is no current offer to accept and walking away is the equivalent to rejecting a great offer, I should make a counter offer.\n*   I'll propose the offer calculated above, where I offer 1 unit of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 7 units of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4 and 3 units of Item 5 to player 2. This leaves me with a value of 665, compared to my outside value of 892.

Let's start by considering an equal split and adjusting from there to a slightly more favorable outcome for me. \n    *   I'll test an offer where I keep 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 1 of item 5 and give the remainder to the other player, which is: give 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n    *   My value for the items I would keep:\n        *   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 36 = 72\n        *   2 units of item 2 = 2 * 99 = 198\n        *   3 units of item 3 = 3 * 34 = 102\n        *   1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 66 = 66\n        *   1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 68 = 68\n        *   Total value = 72 + 198 + 102 + 66 + 68 = 506\n    *   This is far below my outside offer of 775.\n    * I'll try a slightly less generous offer to the other player which is 1 item of type 1, 1 item of type 2, 2 items of type 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. This means I keep the remaining items: 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\n    *   My value for the items I would keep:\n         * 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 36 = 108\n         * 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 99 = 198\n         * 4 units of item 3 = 4 * 34 = 136\n         * 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 66 = 132\n         * 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 68 = 68\n         * Total value = 108 + 198 + 136 + 132 + 68 = 642.\n     *This is also below my outside offer of 775.\n     *I will try an offer giving 1 item of type 1, 0 item of type 2, 1 item of type 3, 0 item of type 4 and 0 items of type 5 to the opponent. This means I keep 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n    * My value for these items:\n        * 3 of item 1 = 3 * 36 = 108\n        * 3 of item 2 = 3 * 99 = 297\n        * 5 of item 3 = 5 * 34 = 170\n        * 2 of item 4 = 2 * 66 = 132\n        * 1 of item 5 = 1 * 68 = 68\n        * Total value = 108 + 297 + 170 + 132 + 68 = 775\n    *This is exactly equal to my outside option. I will therefore try an offer a little more advantageous to me.\n\n    *   I will try an offer where the other player gets 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 0 of item 5. I would keep the rest, which is 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\n    *   My value for these items:\n        * 4 of item 1 = 4 * 36 = 144\n        * 3 of item 2 = 3 * 99 = 297\n        * 5 of item 3 = 5 * 34 = 170\n        * 2 of item 4 = 2 * 66 = 132\n        * 1 of item 5 = 1 * 68 = 68\n        * Total value = 144 + 297 + 170 + 132 + 68 = 811. This is higher than my outside option.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer, as there is no offer.\n*   I should not walk away, because I have found a counteroffer that is better than my outside option.\n*   I will propose the counteroffer to give 0 items of type 1, 0 items of type 2, 1 item of type 3, 0 items of type 4 and 0 items of type 5 to the opponent.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 621. This is my guaranteed fallback.\n*   **Item values:** My private values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 97\n    *   Item 2: 80\n    *   Item 3: 31\n    *   Item 4: 61\n    *   Item 5: 62\n*   **Total pool of items:** 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that if I accept an offer in round 2 it will be worth 0.9 times its value in round 1. Similarly, it will be worth 0.81 times its value in round 1 if accepted in round 3.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to me) is [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 3.\n    *   My value for 1 unit of item 3 is 1 * 31 = 31.\n    *   If I accept this offer, my total value would be 31.\n    *   This is much less than my outside offer value of 621.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to figure out a counteroffer that is better than 621. Since the other player only offered me one item, they are most likely going to value that item more. It would be useful to know their value for each item. But I will start by offering an offer that keeps the highest valued items for myself. Let's try offering the other player 1 unit of items 1, 2, and 4. That would look like this: [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n    *   My value for keeping the remaining items would be:\n        *   3 units of item 1 = 3 * 97 = 291\n        *   2 units of item 2 = 2 * 80 = 160\n        *   6 units of item 3 = 6 * 31 = 186\n        *   1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 61 = 61\n        *   1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 62 = 62\n    *   Total value = 291 + 160 + 186 + 61 + 62 = 760\n    *   This is higher than my outside offer of 621\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer of [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] gives me a value of 31, which is much worse than my outside offer of 621, and should be avoided.\n*   I shouldn't walk away since I can come up with better offers.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer that is better than 621, and offer a division that keeps my highly valued items for myself.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 621\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 97, Item 2: 80, Item 3: 31, Item 4: 61, Item 5: 62\n*   **Total item pool:** 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means any outcome in this round (round 2) is worth 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9 times the face value. Any outcome next round (round 3) is worth 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81 times the face value.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 0, 1, 0, 0].  This means I get 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 3.\n    *   Value of current offer for me: (1 * 97) + (1 * 31) = 128.\n    *   This value must be multiplied by 0.9 for the discount factor. So, the discounted value = 128 * 0.9 = 115.2.\n    *   This value (115.2) is much less than my outside offer (621), so I would not accept this offer.\n*   **My previous offer:** I offered Player 1 [1, 1, 0, 1, 0] in round 1. This means that in my previous offer, I kept 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5.\n    * My value from that previous offer: (3 * 97) + (2 * 80) + (6 * 31) + (1 * 61) + (1 * 62) = 291 + 160 + 186 + 61 + 62 = 760\n    * Discounted value in round 1 was 760 * 0.9^0 = 760\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that is better for me than 621 when discounted by a factor of 0.9.  Let's think about a fair split. I prefer item 1, 2, 4 and 5, and dislike item 3.\n    *   If I counteroffer with [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means I keep everything, my value is (4 * 97) + (3 * 80) + (6 * 31) + (2 * 61) + (1 * 62) = 388 + 240 + 186 + 122 + 62 = 998.\n    * The discounted value will be 998 * 0.9 = 898.2 which is greater than my outside offer.\n    * A split such that I receive half of the most valuable items will be helpful. I will try offering player 1 half of item 1 and half of item 3. There are 4 of item 1 and 6 of item 3, so we will offer [2, 0, 3, 0, 0].\n    * If I propose [2,0,3,0,0], that means I receive [2, 3, 3, 2, 1], which is worth (2*97)+(3*80)+(3*31)+(2*61)+(1*62) = 194 + 240 + 93 + 122 + 62 = 711\n    * The discounted value will be 711 * 0.9 = 639.9 which is greater than 621, so this is better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\nThe current offer of [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] is worth 115.2, much lower than my outside offer of 621.\nMy proposed counter offer of [2, 0, 3, 0, 0] is worth 639.9, higher than my outside offer.\nI should not accept or walk away. I should make a counteroffer, since a deal is better for me than walking away.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 3, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

A good starting offer might be to aim for a more equal split of the total value.\n\n   My total value from all items if I kept them all:\n    (4 * 9) + (5 * 45) + (4 * 64) + (6 * 23) + (7 * 94) = 36 + 225 + 256 + 138 + 658 = 1313.\n\n    A split where Player 2 receives about half the items might look like this: Player 2 gets [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]\n    My value if Player 2 gets [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]:\n        Item 1: (4-2) * 9 = 18\n        Item 2: (5-2) * 45 = 135\n        Item 3: (4-2) * 64 = 128\n        Item 4: (6-3) * 23 = 69\n        Item 5: (7-3) * 94 = 376\n        Total Value: 18 + 135 + 128 + 69 + 376 = 726\n\n   Let's also consider a slightly more generous offer, offering [1,2,1,2,2] of each item to Player 2, so I keep [3, 3, 3, 4, 5]:\n        Item 1: 3 * 9 = 27\n        Item 2: 3 * 45 = 135\n        Item 3: 3 * 64 = 192\n        Item 4: 4 * 23 = 92\n        Item 5: 5 * 94 = 470\n        Total Value = 916\n\n   A very generous offer for Player 2 that might make them accept on their first round will be [3, 3, 3, 4, 5] giving me [1,2,1,2,2]:\n        Item 1: 1 * 9 = 9\n        Item 2: 2 * 45 = 90\n        Item 3: 1 * 64 = 64\n        Item 4: 2 * 23 = 46\n        Item 5: 2 * 94 = 188\n        Total Value = 397.\n\n    Since it is the first round, I want an offer that is favorable but also has a chance to be accepted so I am not starting with a very low offer for me. I also want to avoid a round of offers where I give away my outside offer by being too generous. The first offer would get me a payoff over my outside offer.\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** I want to ensure that my counteroffer doesn't put me below 1049. I'll go for [2,2,2,3,3] to begin\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer that gives Player 2 a reasonable share of the total items. I propose a counteroffer of [2, 2, 2, 3, 3], as described above, to Player 2\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]}\n```\n",

This means I keep [2, 3, 2, 3, 4]. My value for this offer is:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 37 = 74\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 75 = 225\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 65 = 130\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 76 = 228\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 5 = 20\n    *   Total value of current offer: 74 + 225 + 130 + 228 + 20 = 677\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (677) is significantly better than my outside offer (374).\n\n* **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    * It's too early to accept, since a better deal may be possible.\n    * It's better not to make a counteroffer of 0 or everything, which would be Mistake 3.\n    * Let's examine a few counteroffers that would still be better than the outside offer and are reasonable. For example, giving player 1 1 unit of each item ([1,1,1,1,1]):\n        *   My Items: [3,4,3,5,6]\n        *   Total value: 3*37 + 4*75 + 3*65 + 5*76 + 6*5 = 111 + 300 + 195 + 380 + 30 = 1016\n    *   Alternatively, giving player 1 a bit more to see what happens. For example, [2,2,2,2,2]:\n        *   My items: [2,3,2,4,5]\n        *   Total value: 2*37 + 3*75 + 2*65 + 4*76 + 5*5 = 74 + 225 + 130 + 304 + 25 = 758\n    * It appears that offering 2 units of each item is reasonable and could lead to a better outcome.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer (677) is much better than my outside offer (374), but it seems like there may be room for improvement by making a counteroffer.\n*   I should not walk away (Mistake 5) and I should not accept (at least in this round).\n*   I will make a counteroffer of [2, 2, 2, 2, 2].\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 374\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 37, Item 2: 75, Item 3: 65, Item 4: 76, Item 5: 5\n*   **Total items:** 4 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 6 of item 4, 7 of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since it is round 2, any outcome will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1)=0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, compared to round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 2, 2] units of each item. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 37 = 37\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 75 = 75\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 65 = 65\n    *   2 unit of item 4: 2 * 76 = 152\n    *   2 unit of item 5: 2 * 5 = 10\n    *   Total value of the offer: 37 + 75 + 65 + 152 + 10 = 339\n    *   Discounted value of offer at round 2 = 339*0.9 = 305.1\n    *   My discounted value of 305.1 is less than my outside offer value, 374.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to figure out a counteroffer that gives me more than 374 when adjusted for the discount factor. It is generally best to make a counteroffer which is good for myself but not so extreme that Player 1 immediately walks.\n    \n     Before round 2 I offered [2,2,2,2,2]. I will try a slightly more favorable offer to see if it works. I will try offering [1,2,2,2,2] to Player 1 which leaves [3,3,2,4,5] for myself\n    \n    * 3 units of item 1: 3 * 37 = 111\n    * 3 units of item 2: 3 * 75 = 225\n    * 2 units of item 3: 2 * 65 = 130\n    * 4 units of item 4: 4 * 76 = 304\n    * 5 units of item 5: 5 * 5 = 25\n    * Total Value of proposed counteroffer: 111 + 225 + 130 + 304 + 25 = 795\n    * Discounted Value of proposed counteroffer: 795 * 0.9 = 715.5.\n    This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n* The current offer (305.1) is significantly less than my outside offer (374) and thus is not acceptable.\n* I have calculated a counteroffer with a discounted value (715.5) greater than my outside offer (374).\n* Since I can achieve a discounted value higher than my outside offer by making a counteroffer, I will not WALK away.\n* Making this counteroffer also avoids making mistakes of type 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer [1,2,2,2,2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 253. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

In the first round, it's typically beneficial to be more aggressive in order to get a more favorable deal to start with. To decide on a reasonable counteroffer, I will look at the halfway division of items, then skew it slightly more in my favor to get the best value possible. \n\n    *   If I keep 3 of item 1 (worth 108), 3 of item 2 (worth 165), 4 of item 3 (worth 184), 1 of item 4 (worth 10) and 3 of item 5 (worth 291), I will be offering Player 2 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 2 of item 5, while retaining my value at 758.\n    *   If I keep 2 of item 1 (worth 72), 2 of item 2 (worth 110), 3 of item 3 (worth 138), 0 of item 4 (worth 0), and 2 of item 5 (worth 194), I will be offering Player 2 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 of item 5, while retaining my value at 514.\n\n    The offer where I keep 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 3 of item 5 will be the initial counteroffer that I make.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\n*   I will not accept any offer, as there is no offer.\n*   I will not walk away, as I can propose a counteroffer to get a better value than my outside offer.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that gives Player 2 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 2 of item 5, keeping the rest for myself. This will have a value of 758 for me, which is more than my outside offer, and may be acceptable to Player 2.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 0, 2]}\n```\n",

Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep at least half of each item when possible.

Therefore, accepting is a mistake.\n* I can calculate the total value of all the items: (4*58) + (5*55) + (6*24) + (1*7) + (5*83) = 232 + 275 + 144 + 7 + 415 = 1073\n* My outside offer is only about 42% of the total value, so there is still significant gains to be made.\n* Making a counteroffer is the right action in this situation.

Given the discount in the following round, this is a pretty good approach.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer has a discounted value of 608.4, which is much better than my outside offer of 253.\n*  A counter offer where I offer the other player [1, 2, 3, 0, 1] would give me a discounted value of 728.1, which is better for me than accepting the current offer.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counter offer to player 2.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 446. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 3, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 3, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 446.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 58\n    *   Item 2: 55\n    *   Item 3: 24\n    *   Item 4: 7\n    *   Item 5: 83\n*   **Total Item Pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 units\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since we are in round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means any deal we reach now has 90% of the value of a deal in round 1, and it also means our outside offer of 446 will only be worth 0.9*446 = 401.4 if we walk now.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 3, 0, 1]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    My total value for this offer is: (3 * 58) + (3 * 55) + (3 * 24) + (1 * 7) + (4 * 83) = 174 + 165 + 72 + 7 + 332 = 750\n    The discounted value of this offer in round 2 is 750 * 0.9 = 675\n    Since 675 > 446 this is better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's consider a few counteroffers and their values:\n    *   Counteroffer 1 (Keep most for myself): Offer [0, 1, 1, 0, 1] to Player 1. This keeps [4, 4, 5, 1, 4]\n        Value = (4 * 58) + (4 * 55) + (5 * 24) + (1 * 7) + (4 * 83) = 232 + 220 + 120 + 7 + 332 = 911.\n        Discounted value 911 * 0.9 = 819.9\n    *   Counteroffer 2 (Split almost evenly): Offer [2, 2, 3, 0, 2] to player 1. This keeps [2, 3, 3, 1, 3]\n        Value = (2 * 58) + (3 * 55) + (3 * 24) + (1 * 7) + (3 * 83) = 116 + 165 + 72 + 7 + 249 = 609\n        Discounted value 609 * 0.9 = 548.1\n    *   Counteroffer 3 (Give them more): Offer [3, 3, 4, 0, 3] to player 1. This keeps [1, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n        Value = (1 * 58) + (2 * 55) + (2 * 24) + (1 * 7) + (2 * 83) = 58 + 110 + 48 + 7 + 166 = 389\n        Discounted value 389 * 0.9 = 350.1\n       \n    Counteroffer 1 looks best, but we need to consider the discount factor and that the game ends next round.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 675 after discounting, which is much better than my outside offer, 446, and my discounted outside offer of 401.4\n*   Counteroffer 1 would give me a value of 819.9 after discounting IF Player 1 accepts. However, since the game ends next round, it's unlikely I can get them to accept it, as it doesn't give them much. They would have to be valuing those goods very low. And given the number of offers I might not do that well.\n*   Counteroffer 2 is worse.\n*   Counteroffer 3 is worse.\n* Since the last round is coming, and the offer on the table is good, we should accept.\n\n**Final Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This means that offers in later rounds are worth less than offers in earlier rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]. This means I get to keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    \n    My value for this offer is:\n    *   (2 * 56) + (3 * 24) + (3 * 23) + (2 * 64) + (2 * 56) = 112 + 72 + 69 + 128 + 112 = 493\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My current offer value of 493 is higher than my outside offer of 414.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer where I ask for half of the items.\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit offered to Player 1. I keep 2. Value = 2 * 56 = 112\n    *   Item 2: 2 units offered to Player 1. I keep 3. Value = 3 * 24 = 72\n    *   Item 3: 2 units offered to Player 1. I keep 3. Value = 3 * 23 = 69\n    *   Item 4: 2 unit offered to Player 1. I keep 2. Value = 2 * 64 = 128\n    *   Item 5: 2 units offered to Player 1. I keep 2. Value = 2 * 56 = 112\n    *   Total value = 112 + 72 + 69 + 128 + 112= 493.\n        \nLet's also consider a counteroffer where I try to keep as much as possible:\n\n    *   Item 1: 0 units offered to Player 1. I keep 3. Value = 3 * 56 = 168\n    *   Item 2: 0 units offered to Player 1. I keep 5. Value = 5 * 24 = 120\n    *   Item 3: 0 units offered to Player 1. I keep 5. Value = 5 * 23 = 115\n    *   Item 4: 0 units offered to Player 1. I keep 4. Value = 4 * 64 = 256\n    *   Item 5: 0 units offered to Player 1. I keep 4. Value = 4 * 56 = 224\n    *   Total value = 168+120+115+256+224 = 883\n    \n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 493 to me, which is greater than my outside offer of 414. However, by asking for everything, my total value would be 883. If I accept Player 1's offer, my payoff is 493. If I walk, it would be my outside offer of 414. Therefore, I would prefer to not accept this offer. Since this is round 1, there are future opportunities for negotiation.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This means that a deal in later rounds will be worth less than the same deal now.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what kind of offer would be beneficial to me. Since I'm starting, I'll want to make a counteroffer that gives me a good chunk of the total value, while also leaving some for Player 2. I need to make sure that my offer is better than my outside offer, keeping in mind I could do better if we make a deal now (no discount) than if we get to rounds 2 or 3.\n    I should consider an offer that gives Player 2 some, but ensures that I get the better end of the bargain, relative to my private values.\n\n    Let's analyze a couple of possible counteroffers:\n\n    **Counteroffer A:** Giving Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n        *   My Value: (1 * 67) + (1 * 78) + (3 * 28) + (4 * 93) + (1* 26) = 67 + 78 + 84 + 372 + 26 = 627.\n        * Player 2 will be getting 1 unit of 1, 1 unit of 2, 2 unit of 3, 3 unit of 4 and 0 unit of 5.\n\n    **Counteroffer B:** Giving Player 2 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n         *  My value = (2*67) + (2*78) + (4*28) + (5*93) + (1*26) = 134 + 156 + 112 + 465 + 26 = 893.\n         * Player 2 will be getting 0 unit of 1, 0 unit of 2, 1 unit of 3, 2 unit of 4 and 0 unit of 5.\n    **Counteroffer C:** Giving Player 2 0 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5.\n        * My value: (2*67)+(2*78)+(5*28)+(7*93)+26=134+156+140+651+26 =1107\n        * Player 2 will be getting 0 unit of each item\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** \n    * Counteroffer A and B are less than my outside offer (1068). This would be a mistake since it would cause me to potentially lose out on a better guaranteed payoff.\n    * Counteroffer C gives the most value to me, but may be rejected by the other player since it gives him nothing. This is a mistake because it does not follow fair negotiation practices.\n    \n    I need to find an offer that is better than my outside offer and is not totally lopsided.\n\n    **Counteroffer D:** Give Player 2 1 unit of Item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5\n        * My value = 67 + 78 + (3 * 28) + (4 * 93) + 26 = 67 + 78 + 84 + 372 + 26 = 627\n       \n    **Counteroffer E:** Giving player 2 0 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5\n        * My Value: 2*67 + 2*78 + 4*28 + 6*93 + 1*26 = 134 + 156 + 112 + 558 + 26 = 986\n\n    Let's try an offer that gives the other player more of the less valuable items and less of the highly valued items:\n    **Counteroffer F:** Give Player 2 0 unit of Item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5\n    * My value: (2 * 67) + (2 * 78) + (2 * 28) + (5 * 93) + (1 * 26) = 134 + 156 + 56 + 465 + 26 = 837.\n\n    I need an offer better than 1068.\n    \n        **Counteroffer G:** Giving player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 unit of item 5\n        * My value: 67 + 156 + 84 + 651 + 26 = 984\n    \n     **Counteroffer H:** Giving player 2: 0 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 0 unit of item 5\n     * My Value = (2*67) + (2*78) + (4*28) + (7*93) + (1*26) = 134 + 156 + 112 + 651 + 26 = 1079\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\n*   I should NOT walk away as there are offers that give me better than my outside offer.\n*   I should NOT accept any current offers.\n*   I will make counteroffer H. Counteroffer H gives me a value of 1079, which is greater than my outside offer of 1068, and it leaves some room for Player 2 to bargain if they would like.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 586. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 549 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 1068.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 67\n    *   Item 2: 78\n    *   Item 3: 28\n    *   Item 4: 93\n    *   Item 5: 26\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 7 units\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.  This means any deal we make will be worth 0.9 of its raw value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer gives me [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] of each item. The other player is receiving 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 6 of item 4, and 1 of item 5. This means that I would have 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.  \n    My value for this offer is:\n        *   0 * 67 + 0 * 78 + 1 * 28 + 1 * 93 + 0 * 26 = 121.\n    This is the raw value of the items I am receiving. With the discount factor this is 121 * 0.9 = 108.9.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I could make various counteroffers. Let's consider one where I keep a larger share of what I value most. For example, let's look at an offer where Player 2 receives one unit of items 3 and 4: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This is identical to the current offer, which is not acceptable as it's well below my outside offer with the discount. Let's calculate a different potential counteroffer that gives player 2 an equal split of items 1 and 2, keeps the units of item 5, and gives player 2 more of 3 and 4: [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] for player 2, leaving [1, 1, 3, 4, 1] for me.\n    My value for this potential counteroffer would be:\n    1 * 67 + 1 * 78 + 3 * 28 + 4 * 93 + 1 * 26 = 67 + 78 + 84 + 372 + 26 = 627\n    Applying the discount factor for this round 627 * 0.9 = 564.3. \n    This is lower than my outside offer of 1068, and therefore, a bad move.\n    Let's examine another potential counteroffer that tries to get more of what I value. I offer [0,0,3,5,0] to Player 2, keeping [2,2,2,2,1] for myself. \n    The value for me would then be 2*67 + 2*78 + 2*28 + 2*93 + 1*26 = 134 + 156 + 56 + 186 + 26 = 558. \n    Applying the discount factor 558 * 0.9 = 502.2. \n    This is still much lower than my outside offer.\n    Let's calculate an extreme offer where Player 2 gets nothing, which means that I get all the items.\n    The value would be:\n    2*67+2*78+5*28+7*93+1*26 = 134 + 156 + 140 + 651 + 26 = 1107\n    Applying the discount factor 1107 * 0.9 = 996.3\n    Since the current offer is much worse than my outside offer of 1068. I will make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting closer to my outside offer by taking more of the things I value, I will offer to give Player 2 one less of each item that I have 2 of and 2 less of each item that I have 5 or more of, and the one item I have 1 of. \n    I offer [1, 1, 3, 5, 1]. This leaves me [1, 1, 2, 2, 0] and has a value for me of 1 * 67 + 1 * 78 + 2 * 28 + 2 * 93 + 0 * 26 = 67 + 78 + 56 + 186 + 0= 387. Applying the discount factor yields 387 * 0.9 = 348.3.\n    I must improve the offer significantly.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is valued at 108.9, which is far below my outside offer of 1068. The potential counteroffers I just evaluated were also worth less than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   **Accept current offer?** No, the current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer and fails mistake 4.\n*   **Walk away?** I could walk away and get my outside offer of 1068.\n*   **Counteroffer?** I can still make one more offer.  Since I have nothing to lose by trying, I will make a counteroffer that gives Player 2 only 1 unit of item 3 and 1 unit of item 4: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] which is the current offer. I need to make sure I am not making an offer worse than the current offer, or worse than my outside offer. I will offer [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] which gives me [2, 2, 4, 6, 1] and has a value for me of 2*67 + 2*78 + 4*28 + 6*93 + 1*26 = 134 + 156 + 112 + 558 + 26 = 986. Applying the discount factor yields 986*0.9 = 887.4, still worse than outside offer. I need to be more aggressive in my counteroffer. I will offer [0,0,4,6,0] keeping [2,2,1,1,1]. The value is 2*67 + 2*78 + 1*28 + 1*93 + 1*26 = 134 + 156 + 28 + 93 + 26 = 437.  The discounted value is 437 * 0.9 = 393.3. I need to make an even more aggressive offer. I will try an offer that only gives 1 unit of item 3 to player 2: [0,0,1,0,0] This gives me 2*67 + 2*78 + 4*28 + 7*93 + 1*26 = 134 + 156 + 112 + 651 + 26 = 1079 and applying the discount rate we get 1079*0.9 = 971.1. Still less than my outside offer. I need to ask for all the items in this last round. This is a last round, so if player 2 rejects it will result in us both getting our outside offers.\n\nI will offer [0,0,0,0,0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Since it's round 1, the discount factor doesn't affect my immediate decision, but I should consider how it impacts future rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what kind of offer I would make. I want to maximize my value while also making it appealing enough for the other player not to walk. I need to be careful to make sure I retain at least the value of my outside offer.\n    *  A very simple offer is to divide the items in half - this would be [2.5, 1.5, 3, 2, 3]. Since items cannot be split, I need to offer integers. Let's try offering 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\n        *   My value: (5 - 2) * 63 + (3 - 1) * 33 + (6 - 3) * 4 + (4 - 2) * 83 + (6 - 3) * 32\n            = 3 * 63 + 2 * 33 + 3 * 4 + 2 * 83 + 3 * 32\n            = 189 + 66 + 12 + 166 + 96\n            = 529\n        *   This offer is better than my outside offer.\n    *   Let's also consider an offer where I am more aggressive and offer a bit less than half. For example, I could offer 1 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5:\n        *   My value: (5 - 1) * 63 + (3 - 0) * 33 + (6 - 2) * 4 + (4 - 1) * 83 + (6 - 2) * 32\n           = 4 * 63 + 3 * 33 + 4 * 4 + 3 * 83 + 4 * 32\n            = 252 + 99 + 16 + 249 + 128\n            = 744\n        * This also seems like a good starting point.\n        * This offer is also better than my outside offer.\n   *  I will go with the more aggressive offer to begin.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince it's the first round, I should make an offer. I have determined that offering 1 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5 yields a result that is higher than my outside offer and still leaves something for the other player.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

If I were to keep all the items, I would calculate:\n    *   Item 1: 5 * 90 = 450\n    *   Item 2: 3 * 61 = 183\n    *   Item 3: 6 * 59 = 354\n    *   Item 4: 4 * 59 = 236\n    *   Item 5: 6 * 11 = 66\n    *   Total value if I keep everything = 450 + 183 + 354 + 236 + 66 = 1289.\n    I need to make a counter offer that gives me more than 752.\n    I need to offer Player 1 something.

This is greater than 752.\n    If I offer player 1 [2, 0, 3, 1, 3] I would keep [3,3,3,3,3] which gives me 840 as calculated above\n    If I offer player 1 [2, 1, 3, 2, 3] then I would calculate:\n    * Item 1: 3 * 90 = 270\n    * Item 2: 2 * 61 = 122\n    * Item 3: 3 * 59 = 177\n    * Item 4: 2 * 59 = 118\n    * Item 5: 3 * 11 = 33\n    * Total value if I keep this = 270+122+177+118+33 = 720 which is less than 752.\n    I will offer player 1 [2,0,3,1,3].\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of 289 is less than my outside offer of 752. I shouldn't accept it. I can improve upon my outside offer with a counteroffer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 752. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 840 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 3, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 752.\n*   **Item values:** My values are 90 for item 1, 61 for item 2, 59 for item 3, 59 for item 4, and 11 for item 5.\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9.  Since this is round 2, the discount will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n    This means that accepting an offer now is worth 0.9 times the value of accepting the same offer in the first round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 2, 1, 2]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n    My value for the current offer is:\n        * 4 * 90 + 3 * 61 + 4 * 59 + 3 * 59 + 4 * 11 = 360 + 183 + 236 + 177 + 44 = 1000\n    Discounted value is 1000*0.9 = 900\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    Let's consider a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me than the current offer.  I will use player 1's previous offer for round 1 of [1, 0, 2, 1, 2] as a base, and only offer slightly less of the more valuable items (item 1, 2, 3, and 4) to the other player.\n    *   Offering [0, 0, 1, 0, 2] to Player 1 means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n    The value is 5 * 90 + 3 * 61 + 5 * 59 + 4 * 59 + 4 * 11 = 450 + 183 + 295 + 236 + 44 = 1208\n    *  Offering [0, 0, 1, 1, 2] to player 1 means I keep:\n        * Item 1: 5 units\n        * Item 2: 3 units\n        * Item 3: 5 units\n        * Item 4: 3 units\n        * Item 5: 4 units\n    The value is 5 * 90 + 3 * 61 + 5 * 59 + 3 * 59 + 4 * 11 = 450 + 183 + 295 + 177 + 44 = 1149\n    Both of these options are greater than 752, my outside offer, and greater than 1000 ( the un-discounted value of the current offer)\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer of [1, 0, 2, 1, 2], with a discounted value of 900, is better than my outside offer of 752.\n    Counteroffers [0, 0, 1, 0, 2] and [0, 0, 1, 1, 2] are also better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\nThe current offer is better than my outside offer. I can also make an offer that gives a higher value to myself.

I will try offering half of all items that I have in even quantities.\n\n    Let's consider offering the following to Player 2:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 1 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n\n    This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units (2 * 36 = 72)\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit (1 * 76 = 76)\n    *   Item 3: 2 units (2 * 61 = 122)\n    *   Item 4: 3 units (3 * 6 = 18)\n    *   Item 5: 3 units (3 * 45 = 135)\n    *   Total Value: 72 + 76 + 122 + 18 + 135 = 423\n\nThis is much higher than my outside offer value of 48.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer since there isn't one.\n*   I should not walk away since I can propose a counteroffer much higher than my outside offer.\n*   I will make the counteroffer calculated above.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 1045\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 26\n    *   Item 2: 24\n    *   Item 3: 52\n    *   Item 4: 78\n    *   Item 5: 84\n*   **Total items:** 4 units of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an agreement in later rounds is worth less than an agreement in earlier rounds. Specifically, an agreement in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the raw value, and an agreement in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the raw value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 0, 1, 2, 2]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3\n\n    The value of this offer to me is:\n    (2 * 26) + (1 * 24) + (2 * 52) + (3 * 78) + (3 * 84) = 52 + 24 + 104 + 234 + 252 = 666\n    \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (666) is less than my outside offer (1045).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what would be a good counteroffer. I will aim to get more value than my outside option while also being reasonable to Player 1 so that they will consider my counteroffer.\n\n    *   **Option 1:** Give player 1 1 unit of each of the 5 items, keeping 3 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 4 of item 5.  Value to me = 3 * 26 + 0 * 24 + 2 * 52 + 4 * 78 + 4 * 84 = 78 + 0 + 104 + 312 + 336 = 830. Not good enough.\n\n    *    **Option 2:** Give player 1 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 0 of item 5. Value to me = 4*26 + 1*24 + 3*52 + 5*78 + 5*84 = 104+24+156+390+420 = 1094. This is not reasonable as its leaving Player 1 with nothing, which leads to mistake 3. I'd prefer this outcome but it's unlikely to be accepted by player 1.\n\n   *     **Option 3:** Give player 1 [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]. Value to me is (3*26 + 1*24 + 3*52 + 4*78 + 4*84) = 78+24+156+312+336 = 906. Still not good enough\n\n   *    **Option 4:** Give Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. Value to me is (3*26+1*24+2*52+4*78+4*84) = 78+24+104+312+336 = 854. Not good enough\n   *    **Option 5:** Give Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Value to me is (3*26+1*24+3*52+5*78+5*84) = 78+24+156+390+420 = 1068. This is better than the outside offer.\n\n     I want to get a deal but also be reasonable, so Option 5 seems like the most reasonable counteroffer that is also better than my outside option.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer (666) is worse than my outside option (1045).\n*   I should not accept the current offer (mistake 4 if I accept).\n*   I will make a counteroffer. Offering [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] gives me value of 1068 which is more than my outside option of 1045.\n\n**Action:**\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1045\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 26\n    *   Item 2: 24\n    *   Item 3: 52\n    *   Item 4: 78\n    *   Item 5: 84\n*   **Total item pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal in the current round (round 2) will be worth 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9 times its actual value. Any deal in round 3 is worth 0.9^2=0.81 times its actual value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would get:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4 units. Value: 4 * 26 = 104\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1 unit. Value: 1 * 24 = 24\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units. Value: 2 * 52 = 104\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4 units. Value: 4 * 78 = 312\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4 units. Value: 4 * 84 = 336\n    *   Total Value: 104 + 24 + 104 + 312 + 336 = 880\n    *   Discounted Value: 880 * 0.9 = 792\n\n    Since 792 < 1045, accepting the current offer is not good for me. This deal is worse than my outside offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    Let's consider a few counteroffers. The offers in round 1 were not very good to me, so I will aim for something more advantageous this round. Let's offer to give Player 1 half of items 3, 4 and 5. Item 2 is not very valuable to me, but very few units are available, so lets give all of it to Player 1. Item 1 is valuable to me, so lets keep most of it and offer only 1 unit to Player 1. This yields an offer of [1, 1, 1, 2, 2].\n    *   If I give Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 2, 2], then I will get:\n        * Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3. Value: 3 * 26 = 78\n        * Item 2: 1 - 1 = 0. Value: 0 * 24 = 0\n        * Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2. Value: 2 * 52 = 104\n        * Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3. Value: 3 * 78 = 234\n        * Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3. Value: 3 * 84 = 252\n        * Total value: 78+0+104+234+252 = 668\n        * Discounted value: 668 * 0.9 = 601.2\n\n    Let us instead consider giving Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. Then, my offer is:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3. Value: 3 * 26 = 78\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1. Value: 1 * 24 = 24\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2. Value: 2 * 52 = 104\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4. Value: 4 * 78 = 312\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4. Value: 4 * 84 = 336\n    *   Total value: 78 + 24 + 104 + 312 + 336 = 854\n    *   Discounted Value: 854 * 0.9 = 768.6\n    \n\n   Let's also look at giving Player 1 only 1 unit of item 3: [0,0,1,0,0]. Then I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4. Value: 4*26 = 104\n    *   Item 2: 1-0 = 1. Value: 1*24 = 24\n    *   Item 3: 3-1=2. Value: 2*52 = 104\n    *   Item 4: 5-0 = 5. Value: 5*78 = 390\n    *   Item 5: 5-0 = 5. Value: 5*84 = 420\n    *   Total Value: 104 + 24 + 104 + 390 + 420 = 1042\n    *   Discounted Value: 1042 * 0.9 = 937.8\n\n    Let's look at a different offer to Player 1 that includes more of the items that I value less and less of the items that I value more. This would be offering [2,1,2,3,3]. Then I would keep\n     *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2. Value: 2 * 26 = 52\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 1 = 0. Value: 0 * 24 = 0\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 2 = 1. Value: 1 * 52 = 52\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 3 = 2. Value: 2 * 78 = 156\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2. Value: 2 * 84 = 168\n    *   Total Value: 52 + 0 + 52 + 156 + 168 = 428\n    * Discounted value: 428*0.9 = 385.2\n\n    It seems like giving Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] is reasonable.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer yields a discounted value of 792, which is worse than my outside offer of 1045, so I will not accept it.\n*   I will not walk away yet since I can potentially improve my value via a counteroffer.\n*   I will propose the counteroffer of [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This yields a discounted value of 768.6, which is still worse than my outside offer, but this is a negotiation, and I am in round 2 of 3. This is likely a better offer than player 1 was expecting given my previous offer of [1,0,0,0,0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

My total value for all the items is (5 * 59) + (7 * 55) + (7 * 16) + (2 * 70) + (0 * 16) = 295 + 385 + 112 + 140 + 0 = 932. I need to decide how to split these items in a way that will be beneficial for me but still acceptable to Player 2. I also need to consider my outside offer to ensure my offer doesn't give less value.\n    *  **Example 1 (fair-ish split):** Suppose I offer Player 2 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 0 units of item 5. That leaves me with 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. My value from this offer would be 3 * 59 + 4 * 55 + 4 * 16 + 1 * 70 + 0 * 16 = 177 + 220 + 64 + 70 = 531. This is well above my outside offer of 76.\n    *  **Example 2 (very generous to me):** I could propose giving Player 2 only 1 unit each of item 1 and 2, and nothing of other items. That would leave me with 4 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 7 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. My value would be 4 * 59 + 6 * 55 + 7 * 16 + 2 * 70 + 0 * 16 = 236 + 330 + 112 + 140 = 818. This is also well above my outside offer.\n    * I will go with Example 1, it seems like a good starting point and reasonable given no information about my opponent.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n    * I should not accept any current offer, since there are no current offers. \n    * I should not walk away, since I can make an offer above my outside offer\n    * I will propose the counteroffer in Example 1.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 3, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

Let me calculate an alternative counteroffer where I get slightly more value and see how that compares.  Let's try to secure all the item 2 and item 4's as these are my most valuable items, while slightly reducing my quantity of less valuable item 1. So, lets try 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n\n    *   Item 1: 3 units, my value is 3 * 36 = 108\n    *   Item 2: 5 units, my value is 5 * 97 = 485\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit, my value is 1 * 43 = 43\n    *   Item 4: 3 units, my value is 3 * 73 = 219\n    *   Item 5: 2 units, my value is 2 * 9 = 18\n    *   **Total value of proposed counteroffer:** 108 + 485 + 43 + 219 + 18 = 873\n\n    * I have 10 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5 to split. This means a counteroffer where I get 3 units of item 1, 5 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5 means the other agent gets 7 units of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5. So I should provide that counteroffer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 642 which is far higher than my outside offer of 95.\n*   I have calculated that I could propose a counteroffer that would net me even more value - 873\n*   Accepting the current offer would be better than walking away, but I think it's best to propose the counteroffer, as there is still the discount rate to take into account in future rounds, and I think proposing a counter offer is reasonable to secure my best position here.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [7, 1, 1, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine my best action in this first round.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 746\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 24\n    *   Item 2: 24\n    *   Item 3: 49\n    *   Item 4: 90\n    *   Item 5: 14\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 4\n    *   Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of a deal in round 1 and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 (0.9^2) times the value of a deal in round 1. Since there are 3 rounds, waiting increases the likelihood that I will get a smaller value if a deal is made in the subsequent rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I might offer to Player 2 to get a deal that is worth more than my outside offer. I don't want to offer everything to Player 2 since I need to also get value. As a first step, I should determine my total value if I keep everything.\n\nTotal value for keeping everything:\n* Item 1: 6 * 24 = 144\n* Item 2: 4 * 24 = 96\n* Item 3: 3 * 49 = 147\n* Item 4: 4 * 90 = 360\n* Item 5: 6 * 14 = 84\n* Total: 144 + 96 + 147 + 360 + 84 = 831\n\nSince my total possible value is 831, I need to find a way to keep enough so that my value is greater than 746. Let's start with a counteroffer that gives Player 2 roughly half the items. Here's what that might look like.\n\nCounteroffer 1: Give Player 2 3 item 1, 2 item 2, 1 item 3, 2 item 4, and 3 item 5\nThis will leave me with 3 item 1, 2 item 2, 2 item 3, 2 item 4, and 3 item 5.\nMy value would be:\n* Item 1: 3 * 24 = 72\n* Item 2: 2 * 24 = 48\n* Item 3: 2 * 49 = 98\n* Item 4: 2 * 90 = 180\n* Item 5: 3 * 14 = 42\n* Total = 72 + 48 + 98 + 180 + 42 = 440\nThis is not good, since it's far lower than my outside offer.\n\nCounteroffer 2: Give Player 2 1 item 1, 1 item 2, 1 item 3, 1 item 4, and 1 item 5\nThis will leave me with 5 item 1, 3 item 2, 2 item 3, 3 item 4, and 5 item 5.\nMy value would be:\n* Item 1: 5 * 24 = 120\n* Item 2: 3 * 24 = 72\n* Item 3: 2 * 49 = 98\n* Item 4: 3 * 90 = 270\n* Item 5: 5 * 14 = 70\n* Total = 120 + 72 + 98 + 270 + 70 = 630\nThis is also not good since it's lower than my outside offer.\n\nI need to offer Player 2 less to reach a value over 746.\n\nCounteroffer 3: Give player 2 0 items of any type\nThis would leave me with all items and a value of 831. This is more than 746. However, this violates the rule of not offering 0 items.\n\nCounteroffer 4: Give Player 2 0 items of types 1, 2, 3, 4 and 1 item of type 5.\nThis will leave me with 6 item 1, 4 item 2, 3 item 3, 4 item 4, and 5 item 5.\nMy value would be:\n* Item 1: 6 * 24 = 144\n* Item 2: 4 * 24 = 96\n* Item 3: 3 * 49 = 147\n* Item 4: 4 * 90 = 360\n* Item 5: 5 * 14 = 70\n* Total = 144 + 96 + 147 + 360 + 70 = 817.\n\nThis value (817) is greater than my outside offer of 746.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nI should make counteroffer 4.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

This means that if the deal is reached in round 2, my value is multiplied by 0.9 and in round 3 by 0.9*0.9 = 0.81. In round 1 the discount factor is 1.0.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so my value from accepting is N/A.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to decide what I should offer to player 2. To avoid Mistake 3 (offering nothing or all items), I should offer a reasonable amount of each item to Player 2.\n   *  I should aim to make an offer that leaves me with an overall value greater than my outside option value, 887, to avoid mistake 2.\n  Let's start by calculating the maximum value if I were to keep all items and offer nothing to player 2:\n   7*39+1*23+8*20+5*34+4*96 = 273+23+160+170+384 = 1010.\n   \n   Let's consider offering Player 2 half of each item type if possible, rounding down for indivisible items:\n    *   Item 1: 3 units to Player 2, keeping 4 units: 4*39 = 156\n    *   Item 2: 0 units to Player 2, keeping 1 unit: 1*23 = 23\n    *   Item 3: 4 units to Player 2, keeping 4 units: 4*20 = 80\n    *   Item 4: 2 units to Player 2, keeping 3 units: 3*34 = 102\n    *   Item 5: 2 units to Player 2, keeping 2 units: 2*96 = 192\n    Total value to me = 156+23+80+102+192 = 553. This is less than my outside offer. This offer is no good.\n   Let's consider offering a small amount of each item type to Player 2:\n   * Item 1: 1 unit to Player 2, keeping 6: 6*39 = 234\n   * Item 2: 0 unit to Player 2, keeping 1: 1*23=23\n   * Item 3: 1 unit to Player 2, keeping 7: 7*20 = 140\n   * Item 4: 1 unit to Player 2, keeping 4: 4*34 = 136\n   * Item 5: 1 unit to Player 2, keeping 3: 3*96 = 288\n   Total Value to me = 234+23+140+136+288 = 821. This is also less than my outside option.\n    Let's try offering only 1 unit of item 5:\n    * Item 1: 0 unit to Player 2, keeping 7: 7*39 = 273\n    * Item 2: 0 unit to Player 2, keeping 1: 1*23=23\n    * Item 3: 0 unit to Player 2, keeping 8: 8*20 = 160\n    * Item 4: 0 unit to Player 2, keeping 5: 5*34 = 170\n    * Item 5: 1 unit to Player 2, keeping 3: 3*96 = 288\n    Total value to me = 273+23+160+170+288 = 914. This is a better value to me than my outside option of 887.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer because there is no current offer.\n*   I should not walk away because I can achieve a value greater than my outside offer.\n*   I should make a counteroffer that provides me with a value greater than my outside offer and a chance of a deal. I will offer only one unit of item 5 to Player 2.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 1331. This is the baseline value I want to at least achieve through negotiation.\n*   **Item values:** My private values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 34\n    *   Item 2: 21\n    *   Item 3: 77\n    *   Item 4: 75\n    *   Item 5: 34\n*   **Total items:** The available items are:\n    *   Item 1: 7\n    *   Item 2: 1\n    *   Item 3: 8\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. This means that a deal in a later round is worth less than a deal in an earlier round. Specifically, a deal in round 2 would be worth 0.9 times the value of the deal, and a deal in round 3 would be worth 0.9^2 or 0.81 times the value of the deal.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I get:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 34 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 21 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 77 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 75 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 34 = 34\n    My total value for this offer is 34.\n*  **Comparing to outside offer:** The current offer value of 34 is *much* lower than my outside offer of 1331.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I have all of the items currently, so the best thing would be to offer Player 1 something but less than what would bring my value below 1331. I could offer them one unit of item 4 for example:\n    *  Offering Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. \n    *  I would keep 7 units of item 1: 7 * 34 = 238\n    *  I would keep 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 21 = 21\n    *  I would keep 8 units of item 3: 8 * 77 = 616\n    *  I would keep 4 unit of item 4: 4 * 75 = 300\n    *  I would keep 4 unit of item 5: 4 * 34 = 136\n    My total value would be 1311, which is less than the outside offer but may lead to a compromise.  This is not a mistake to offer less than my outside offer as long as I am getting more than my outside offer with what I'm keeping.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible, with a value of 34. This is way below my outside offer. Accepting would be a mistake.\n*   Walking away would give me 1331, but if I could get an acceptable offer it would be worth the wait.\n*   Making a counteroffer is the best option. If I offer player 1 just one item, they will likely offer more than they currently are.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 560. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 858 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 560.\n*   **Item Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 87\n    *   Item 2: 29\n    *   Item 3: 81\n    *   Item 4: 76\n    *   Item 5: 13\n*   **Total Pool of Items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 6 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that an agreement reached in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times its raw value and in round 3 its value will be 0.81 times its raw value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since this is round 1 and there is no current offer, I need to make an initial offer to Player 2. Let's explore some potential options. I will aim for a distribution that favors myself but still offers Player 2 a reasonable amount to avoid a walk-away.\n\n    *   **Option 1: Offer Player 2 half of everything:** This would give the other player 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This would leave me with: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n        *   My Value: (2 * 87) + (2 * 29) + (2 * 81) + (3 * 76) + (1 * 13) = 174 + 58 + 162 + 228 + 13 = 635\n        *   This is more than my outside offer of 560.\n\n    *   **Option 2: Offer Player 2 1 unit of each item:** This would give the other player 1 unit of each item and leave me with 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n        *   My Value: (2 * 87) + (3 * 29) + (3 * 81) + (5 * 76) + (1 * 13) = 174 + 87 + 243 + 380 + 13 = 897\n         * This is more than my outside offer of 560.\n\n    *   **Option 3: Give the other player more item 4 (the item I value highly):** Give the other player 1 unit of items 1,2,3 and 4 units of item 4 and 0 of item 5. This would leave me with 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5\n         *   My Value = 174 + 87 + 243 + 152 + 26 = 682\n\nLet's choose **Option 1** as a reasonable starting point for the negotiation as it is a fair starting offer. This provides a high value for myself and the other player while also leaving room for negotiation.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that gives player 2 a fair share of items but still maximizes my value while leaving some room to negotiate.\n*   My selected counter offer is offering Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

For now it is sufficient to note that if I am going to make a counteroffer, it must give me a value of more than 77.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 479, which is much higher than my outside offer of 77. Therefore, I should not walk away, and I should not make a counteroffer worse than what I have been offered.\n*   However, I should not make a counteroffer that is worse than 77 either.\n*   I do not have to make an offer of all or nothing.\n*   I should accept the current offer, as it is far better than my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This means that if a deal is reached in round 2, the value of the deal is multiplied by 0.9, if reached in round 3, the value of the deal is multiplied by 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] (1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 units of item 5).\n    *   My value from the current offer:\n        *   Item 1: 1 * 59 = 59\n        *   Item 2: 1 * 7 = 7\n        *   Item 3: 1 * 47 = 47\n        *   Item 4: 1 * 49 = 49\n        *   Item 5: 0 * 12 = 0\n        *   Total value of current offer to me = 59 + 7 + 47 + 49 + 0= 162\n\n    Since this is round 1, this is the current offer value and no discount needed. \n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    * I will need to give Player 1 something, but I need to make sure my remaining value is above my outside offer.\n   * I will begin by assessing what value I would get by keeping all the items, which is 599 (59*3+7*4+47*5+49*3+12*1= 177+28+235+147+12=599)\n   * It appears I can make a counteroffer that improves my position substantially over the current offer.\n   * Lets check the value of the following division:\n     * Keep 2 units of item 1 = 118\n     * Keep 3 units of item 2 = 21\n     * Keep 4 units of item 3 = 188\n     * Keep 2 units of item 4 = 98\n     * Keep 1 unit of item 5 = 12\n   *This gives us a total of: 437, which is equal to my outside offer.\n   * I will propose an offer slightly better for me in the first round, which is keeping 3, 4, 5, 3, 1 minus one unit each of 1 and 3.\n    * Counteroffer: offer player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] \n   * My value if this offer is accepted:\n       * Item 1: 2 * 59 = 118\n       * Item 2: 4 * 7 = 28\n       * Item 3: 4 * 47 = 188\n       * Item 4: 3 * 49 = 147\n       * Item 5: 1 * 12 = 12\n       * Total value of counter offer to me = 118 + 28 + 188 + 147 + 12 = 493\n   * This value 493 is better than the current offer value of 162 and outside value of 437\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (162) is significantly worse than my outside offer (437).

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 163. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 255. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 720 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 255\n*   **My item values:** \n    *   Item 1: 17\n    *   Item 2: 52\n    *   Item 3: 53\n    *   Item 4: 24\n    *   Item 5: 94\n*   **Total pool of items:** 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is less valuable to me.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n\n    My total value for the current offer is:\n    (1 * 17) + (3 * 52) + (3 * 53) + (3 * 24) + (2 * 94) = 17 + 156 + 159 + 72 + 188 = 592\n    Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1. Therefore, my discounted value of accepting this offer is still 592.\n\n*   **Comparison with outside offer:** 592 > 255. Accepting the current offer is better than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to formulate a counteroffer that maximizes my value but is still likely to be accepted by Player 1. I should try to get more of the items I value more, particularly items 5, 3 and 2. I can aim for giving the other player less of each item that is currently being offered, since those have the biggest impact on my total value.  \n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 [0,0,1,0,0].\n    This leaves me with:\n    *   Item 1: 1-0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 4-0 = 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 5-1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 4-0 = 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 3-0 = 3 units\n     My total value of this offer would be:\n    (1 * 17) + (4 * 52) + (4 * 53) + (4 * 24) + (3 * 94) = 17 + 208 + 212 + 96 + 282 = 815\n    815 > 592. Thus, this is a better offer for me than the current one.\n\nLet's consider another counteroffer where I offer player 1 [0,0,0,0,0]\n    This leaves me with:\n    *   Item 1: 1-0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 4-0 = 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 5-0 = 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 4-0 = 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 3-0 = 3 units\n     My total value of this offer would be:\n    (1 * 17) + (4 * 52) + (5 * 53) + (4 * 24) + (3 * 94) = 17 + 208 + 265 + 96 + 282 = 868. This is my maximum achievable payoff. This might be considered a bad offer by player 1.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince 592 > 255, I shouldn't walk away.\nI will make a counteroffer of [0, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 255\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 17, Item 2: 52, Item 3: 53, Item 4: 24, Item 5: 94\n*   **Total items:** 1 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means that any deal made this round will be worth 90% of its undiscounted value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    \n    My value for this offer is: (1 * 17) + (3 * 52) + (3 * 53) + (3 * 24) + (2 * 94) = 17 + 156 + 159 + 72 + 188 = 592\n    The discounted value of this offer is 592 * 0.9 = 532.8\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider my potential counteroffers. However, since I have to decide now, I will first evaluate if the current offer is better than my outside offer, discounted. The discounted outside offer this round is still 255. So I know my total value would have to be greater than 255/0.9 = 283.33\nThe current offer is worth 532.8 > 255, so I know that accepting would be better than walking away. I will consider some potential counteroffers and compare them to see if I can get an even better deal. It would be foolish to make an offer which values less than 255. I also will not propose an offer which gives everything to player 1.\n    Let's say I want to keep 1 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 2 of item 5. This is the offer currently proposed, and is worth 532.8 if accepted this round.\n    How about offering [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] to Player 1. Then I have 1 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 3 of item 5. Value = (1*17)+(4*52)+(4*53)+(4*24)+(3*94) = 17+208+212+96+282=815. Discounted value = 815 * 0.9 = 733.5\n    How about offering [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Then I have 1 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 2 of item 5. Value = (1*17)+(3*52)+(4*53)+(3*24)+(2*94) = 17+156+212+72+188 = 645. Discounted value = 645 * 0.9 = 580.5\n    \n    \n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is 532.8, which is better than my outside offer of 255. Making an offer of [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] gives a value of 733.5, and making an offer of [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] gives a value of 580.5. In round 1, I proposed [0,0,1,0,0] so I should not propose a worse offer. The current offer of [0, 1, 2, 1, 1] is better than the counteroffer [0,1,1,1,1]. Therefore, I should accept this current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 1031. This is my guaranteed fallback value.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 67 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 98 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 6 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 91 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 71 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   4 units of item 1\n    *   5 units of item 2\n    *   5 units of item 3\n    *   5 units of item 4\n    *   0 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means that if a deal is reached in round 2, the values are multiplied by 0.9^(2-1)= 0.9. And if reached in round 3, by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81. Thus, getting a good deal early is more valuable than waiting until the last round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so I don't have any offer to evaluate for acceptance\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to think about how to make a reasonable first offer.\n    *   I could try for an even split to start, keeping 2 of item 1, 2 or 3 of item 2, 2 or 3 of item 3, 2 or 3 of item 4 and 0 of item 5\n    * I could also attempt to get a higher payoff and offer less to player 2. This could be risky early on, as player 2 may walk.\n\n    Let's calculate the value of an even split of 2,2,2,2,0:\n        * 2 of item 1: 2 * 67 = 134\n        * 2 of item 2: 2 * 98 = 196\n        * 2 of item 3: 2 * 6 = 12\n        * 2 of item 4: 2 * 91 = 182\n        * 0 of item 5: 0 * 71 = 0\n        * Total: 134 + 196 + 12 + 182 + 0= 524\n\n    Let's calculate the value of keeping 3 of each item except item 5:\n        * 3 of item 1: 3 * 67 = 201\n        * 3 of item 2: 3 * 98 = 294\n        * 3 of item 3: 3 * 6 = 18\n        * 3 of item 4: 3 * 91 = 273\n        * 0 of item 5: 0 * 71 = 0\n        * Total: 201+ 294+18+273+0= 786\n\n   Let's calculate the value of keeping 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4 and 0 of item 5:\n        * 3 of item 1: 3 * 67 = 201\n        * 4 of item 2: 4 * 98 = 392\n        * 4 of item 3: 4 * 6 = 24\n        * 4 of item 4: 4 * 91 = 364\n        * 0 of item 5: 0 * 71 = 0\n        * Total: 201 + 392 + 24 + 364 + 0 = 981\n\n    * How do these values compare to my outside offer? The even split of 2,2,2,2,0 is worse than my outside option of 1031. Keeping 3 of each except item 5 is also worse than my outside offer. Keeping 3,4,4,4,0 is also worse than my outside offer. Therefore I should try to get the better items. Lets try keeping most of items 2 and 4, and most of item 1 and only some of item 3: \n      Keep 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 0 of item 5. Offer 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 0 of item 5.\n\n      My value:\n        * 3 of item 1: 3 * 67 = 201\n        * 4 of item 2: 4 * 98 = 392\n        * 2 of item 3: 2 * 6 = 12\n        * 4 of item 4: 4 * 91 = 364\n        * 0 of item 5: 0 * 71 = 0\n        * Total: 201 + 392 + 12 + 364 + 0 = 969\n\n    This is still less than my outside offer of 1031, therefore I will try to keep everything of my high value items and give away only some of the lowest valued item:\n      Keep 4 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 0 of item 5. Offer 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 0 of item 5.\n      My Value:\n        * 4 of item 1: 4 * 67 = 268\n        * 5 of item 2: 5 * 98 = 490\n        * 3 of item 3: 3 * 6 = 18\n        * 5 of item 4: 5 * 91 = 455\n        * 0 of item 5: 0 * 71 = 0\n        * Total: 268+490+18+455+0 = 1231.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer, because there is none.\n*   Walking away is not an option, as I have a chance to secure a better deal.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer to Player 2.\n    My counteroffer will be to offer 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 0 of item 5, which leaves me with all of items 1, 2 and 4, 3 of item 3, and 0 of item 5, which I calculated above to be 1231, greater than my outside offer of 1031.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since this is round 3, the discount factor will be 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of keeping: (4 * 67) + (4 * 98) + (5 * 6) + (5 * 91) + (0 * 71) = 268 + 392 + 30 + 455 + 0 = 1145\n    *   Discounted value: 1145 * 0.81 = 927.45\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since this is the last round, if Player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer it is treated as a walk, thus the counteroffer should not aim to make Player 2 accept, but instead be the best possible offer for myself if Player 2 walks.\n    *   If I offer everything to Player 2, the total value would be 0.\n    *   If I offer nothing to Player 2, the total value would be 1145.\n    *   Since we are in the last round, I should offer a division of items to Player 2 that will give me the highest value if Player 2 walks away, since that is the only scenario possible at this round for a non-walk.\n\n*   **Comparison to my outside offer:**\n    *   The discounted value of accepting the current offer (927.45) is less than my outside offer (1031).\n    *   Keeping all items would give me a total value of 1145, which multiplied by the discount factor is 927.45. It is greater than my outside offer if we are in a walk scenario.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth less than my outside offer, so accepting is Mistake 4.\n*   Walking away would secure my outside offer (1031).\n*   If I make any counter offer, Player 2 would walk away, giving me the remaining items, which is the same outcome as if I were to walk away, except that I have to make the additional action.\n\nSince the outcome of my counteroffer will be the same as the outcome of walking away, I should simply walk away to get the 1031 offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 875. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 975 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Discounted at this round is 1612 * 0.9 = 1450.8\n    * Let's try offering half of the items to the other player if possible, which would mean offering [3, 1, 3, 2, 3] to player 2, and keeping [4, 2, 4, 3, 3].\n    My value would be (4*90) + (2*83) + (4*50) + (3*89) + (3*13) = 360 + 166 + 200 + 267 + 39 = 1032. Discounted value at this round is 1032 * 0.9 = 928.8.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Current offer's discounted value: 1450.8 > 875\n    *   Keeping the same as the previous offer gives 1146.6 > 875\n    *   Offering half items gives 928.8 > 875\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer (giving us 1450.8) is significantly better than our outside offer (875).\n*   Our previous offer gave a discounted value of 1146.6 and offering a 50/50 split gave 928.8, so both are also better than the outside offer, but worse than the current offer.\n*   It is not in my interest to propose any counter offer worse than 1450.8, which the current offer gives us.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine my best action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 555. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 16\n    *   Item 2: 12\n    *   Item 3: 49\n    *   Item 4: 84\n    *   Item 5: 35\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 8 units\n    *   Item 5: 0 units\n*  **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times as much as the same deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 times as much as the same deal in round 1. This incentivizes reaching an agreement earlier.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I'm going first, I need to consider what to offer.  It's important not to make mistakes by giving away so much that my payoff is less than my outside offer. Since I am the first player I want to make an initial offer which gives the other player enough so that they do not walk away from the negotiation entirely in the first round, but doesn't give them so much that the value to me is too small. \n  * If I give the other player 1 unit of each of item 1, 2, and 3, then 2 of item 4, and 0 of item 5, my value is\n     *   Item 1: 1 * 16 = 16\n     *   Item 2: 1 * 12 = 12\n     *   Item 3: 1 * 49 = 49\n     *   Item 4: 6 * 84 = 504\n     *   Item 5: 0 * 35 = 0\n      Total Value: 581. This is a pretty good offer for me, but might not be enough to tempt player 2\n    * If I give the other player 0 unit of items 1, 2 and 3, 2 units of 4 and 0 of 5, my value is:\n       * Item 1: 2 * 16 = 32\n       * Item 2: 2 * 12 = 24\n       * Item 3: 2 * 49 = 98\n       * Item 4: 6 * 84 = 504\n       * Item 5: 0 * 35 = 0\n      Total value: 658. This is still a reasonably strong offer, but might be too favorable for me.\n\n    * If I give the other player 1 unit of each of items 1, 2 and 3, 4 units of 4, and 0 units of 5 my value is:\n       * Item 1: 1 * 16 = 16\n       * Item 2: 1 * 12 = 12\n       * Item 3: 1 * 49 = 49\n       * Item 4: 4 * 84 = 336\n       * Item 5: 0 * 35 = 0\n      Total Value: 413 This is not acceptable, as it is less than my outside offer. I must make sure I am making an offer that is better than my outside offer. I should keep 6 units of item 4 and at least 1 unit of the others, or 2 if I want to be extremely selfish.\n\n     * Let's offer the other player 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, and 2 units of item 4.\n      *   Item 1: 1 * 16 = 16\n        * Item 2: 1 * 12 = 12\n        * Item 3: 1 * 49 = 49\n        * Item 4: 6 * 84 = 504\n        * Item 5: 0 * 35 = 0\n      Total value: 581 This is a good offer for me, since it's significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI should not walk away since I have not yet made a move. The most reasonable course of action is to make a counteroffer. Based on my analysis above, I will offer player 2 one unit of items 1, 2, and 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This gives me a value of 581.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on my action for round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 902\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 100\n    *   Item 2: 71\n    *   Item 3: 33\n    *   Item 4: 75\n    *   Item 5: 86\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 6 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times the value, and a deal in round 3 will be worth 0.81 (0.9^2) times the value. Since there is no offer on the table I don't have to consider the discount factor, and will base my decision only on round one values.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    I need to propose a counteroffer that is better for me than my outside option of 902. A naive approach would be to divide the items equally. Let's see what my total value would be if I kept the majority of the items.\n\n    If I keep 2 units of item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 4 of item 5 for myself, then I would calculate my value as such:\n    * 2 * 100 = 200\n    * 4 * 71 = 284\n    * 3 * 33 = 99\n    * 1 * 75 = 75\n    * 4 * 86 = 344\n    * Total = 1002.\n    This is more than my outside offer.\n    \n    If I keep 1 unit of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 3 of item 5 for myself, then I would calculate my value as such:\n    * 1 * 100 = 100\n    * 3 * 71 = 213\n    * 2 * 33 = 66\n    * 1 * 75 = 75\n    * 3 * 86 = 258\n    * Total = 712\n    This is less than my outside offer.\n\n    A good offer that is better than my outside offer but gives player 2 something would be to offer them half of each. Since this would be an odd division for all item types, I will slightly favor myself.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no offer on the table, and an equal split would net me a value well over my outside offer, I should make a counteroffer. Giving 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5 to player 2 would make a good first offer, as this is more than half of each item.\n\n**My action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

The fact that the current offer is below my outside offer, means if I make a counteroffer, it must be high enough to not only be better than my outside offer but to account for the discount that will come if we are in round two. A simple offer with me keeping 2 of each of item 1, 4 of each of item 2, 3 of each of item 3, 1 of each of item 4, 4 of each of item 5 would yield me:\n    (2 * 14) + (4 * 13) + (3 * 28) + (1 * 79) + (4 * 9) = 28 + 52 + 84 + 79 + 36 = 279\n    This means an offer to player 1 of [1, 2, 1, 1, 2] would work and it is the most straightforward to implement.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n*   The current offer is worth 165, which is less than my outside offer of 178. Accepting would be Mistake 4.\n*   Since it is round 1, and I have the chance to make a counteroffer, which can be better than accepting, or walking away.\n*   A counteroffer of [1, 2, 1, 1, 2] would be 165 for Player 1.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

Accepting would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n*   Walking away would mean receiving 902.\n*   I will look for a counteroffer that is better than my outside option.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep slightly more of each item type. Specifically I will ask for [0,1,0,0,1]. This means I would get:\n* Item 1: 3\n* Item 2: 5\n* Item 3: 4\n* Item 4: 2\n* Item 5: 5\n\nThis would give a value of:\n(3*100) + (5*71) + (4*33) + (2*75) + (5*86) = 300 + 355 + 132 + 150 + 430 = 1367\nDiscounted value = 1367 * 0.9 = 1230.3\n\nThis is a much higher offer than my outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 848.\n*   **Item values:** My values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 42\n    *   Item 2: 72\n    *   Item 3: 36\n    *   Item 4: 78\n    *   Item 5: 55\n*   **Total pool of items:** \n    *   4 units of item 1\n    *   4 units of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   5 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times its raw value, and an offer accepted in round 3 will be worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times its raw value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I am the first player, I need to make an initial offer.  I need to consider offers that are not worse than my outside offer and are reasonable. A starting point could be to offer a roughly even split (although this might not be optimal). Let me calculate the value of a few potential offers:\n\n    *   **Offer 1:** Giving player 2 half of each item type, as close as possible.\n        *  Player 2 receives: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n        * I keep: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n        *   Value for me: (2 * 42) + (2 * 72) + (1 * 36) + (1 * 78) + (3 * 55) = 84 + 144 + 36 + 78 + 165 = 507\n    *   **Offer 2:** Giving player 2 less than half\n        *  Player 2 receives: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n        * I keep: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 2 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n        *   Value for me: (3 * 42) + (3 * 72) + (2 * 36) + (2 * 78) + (3 * 55) = 126 + 216 + 72 + 156 + 165 = 735\n    *    **Offer 3:** Giving player 2 the bare minimum \n         * Player 2 receives: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n         * I keep: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n         *  Value for me: (3 * 42) + (3 * 72) + (2 * 36) + (2 * 78) + (4 * 55) = 126 + 216 + 72 + 156 + 220 = 790\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** Offer 1 (value 507) is significantly below my outside offer of 848. Offer 2 and Offer 3 are also below my outside offer. This means it would be best to only offer something that is better than 848 for me.\n\nSince the current offer is none, I must make a counteroffer. Given that we are in round 1, the other player may make a counteroffer. This means that I want to start with a fairly aggressive offer so that I can improve upon it. Let's propose the following:\n * Player 2 receives: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n    \n     * I keep: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n    *   Value for me: (3 * 42) + (3 * 72) + (2 * 36) + (2 * 78) + (4 * 55) = 126 + 216 + 72 + 156 + 220 = 790\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   Since I have no current offer to consider, I must make a counteroffer.\n*   Offering 1, 1, 0, 0, 1 is the first step.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

I'll calculate the value of that offer to myself. This would look like giving Player 1 [2, 2, 1, 1, 2]. This is just to help me decide what I want to offer, it isn't the only possible counteroffer.\n\n    * I would keep: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n       *   Value calculation:\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 92 = 184\n        *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 39 = 78\n        *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 73 = 73\n        *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 57 = 57\n        *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 100 = 300\n        *   Total value: 184 + 78 + 73 + 57 + 300 = 692\n\n    *   This counteroffer would be better than my outside offer.\n    *   Now let me consider a more extreme counteroffer. If I propose to offer player 1 only one unit of each item, what would be the outcome for me?\n\n        *  I would keep: 3 unit of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n            *  Value calculation:\n                *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 92 = 276\n                *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 39 = 117\n                *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 73 = 73\n                *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 57 = 57\n                *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 100 = 400\n                *   Total value: 276 + 117 + 73 + 57 + 400 = 923.\n\n    * This offer would also be better than my outside offer. This is a better value to me than offering player 1 half of the items.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer (keeping 3 of 1, 3 of 2, 2 of 3, 2 of 4, and 4 of 5)  is worth 1053 to me.\n*   My outside offer is worth 502 to me.\n*   Since the current offer is significantly better than my outside offer, I should consider accepting it, however, I might be able to get a better offer if I counter.\n*   In this first round I am going to offer slightly less generous offer than half the items. I will offer the other player 1 of each of the first four items and 2 of item five.

Since I have the most units of item 1, let's give one of those away, and also give away one each of all the rest.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:**  Offer Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n        *   My remaining items: 6 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n        *   My value: (6 * 11) + (1 * 30) + (1 * 73) + (1 * 95) + (4 * 10) = 66 + 30 + 73 + 95 + 40 = 304\n        *   This is greater than my outside offer of 292.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 2:**  Offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n        *   My remaining items: 7 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n         *   My value: (7 * 11) + (2 * 30) + (2 * 73) + (2 * 95) + (5 * 10) = 77 + 60 + 146 + 190 + 50 = 523\n        *   This is greater than my outside offer of 292, but gives nothing to the opponent.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 3:** Offer Player 2 [2, 1, 1, 1, 2].\n        * My remaining items: 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n        * My value: (5 * 11) + (1 * 30) + (1 * 73) + (1 * 95) + (3 * 10) = 55 + 30 + 73 + 95 + 30 = 283\n         *   This is less than my outside offer of 292, so this is not a good offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nBased on the above analysis, offering Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] seems like a good starting point.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 847.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 98\n    *   Item 2: 48\n    *   Item 3: 82\n    *   Item 4: 76\n    *   Item 5: 100\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 7 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9.

However, I can also propose a counteroffer that would get me more value.\n*    I can avoid mistake 1, because I am going to make a counteroffer (my first offer) that will get me more value than the current offer.\n*    I can avoid mistake 2, because my counteroffer will give me more value than my outside offer.\n*    I can avoid mistake 3 by making a counteroffer that gives the other player more than nothing, and that does not give them everything.\n*   I can avoid mistake 4 because I am going to make a counteroffer.\n*   I can avoid mistake 5 because I am not accepting the current offer, which is not the best that I can get.\n*   I will make a counteroffer that aims to maximize my payoff.

This means I keep all the items.\n    *   Value of keeping all items: (7 * 98) + (2 * 48) + (2 * 82) + (2 * 76) + (5 * 100) = 686 + 96 + 164 + 152 + 500 = 1598\n    *   Discounted value = 1598 * 0.9 = 1438.2\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    *   I need to consider whether to make a counteroffer, or walk away.  Given the current offer gives a discounted value of 1438.2, which is much higher than my outside offer, I don't want to walk.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n*   Accepting this offer gives me a discounted value of 1438.2. \n*   This is much greater than my outside offer value of 847.\n*   I should accept this offer\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",
