                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n**Understanding the Game:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Maximize my (Player 1) discounted value from the negotiation, which is the value of items I receive * gamma^(round-1), or outside option if we walk away.\n*   **Private Values:** I value items 1-5 at 18, 96, 21, 86, and 67 respectively.\n*   **Item Quantities:** There are 1, 2, 6, 2, and 5 units of items 1-5, respectively.\n*   **Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 687.\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9, implying a slight preference for earlier deals.\n*   **Rounds:** 3 rounds of negotiation.\n*   **Available Actions:** In round 1 I can either propose a counteroffer to player 2 or walk away.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Calculate Total Value:** First I need to calculate my value of all items:\n    (1 * 18) + (2 * 96) + (6 * 21) + (2 * 86) + (5 * 67) = 18 + 192 + 126 + 172 + 335 = 843\n2.  **Optimal Strategy:** In the first round, if we propose an extremely generous offer (such that player 2 receives everything) we would receive nothing. So it is always better to make a counteroffer which will leave us with something, assuming the other player does not walk away.\n3.  **Counter Offer Strategy:** The best outcome is that player 2 accepts a counteroffer in the first round. Therefore I should make an offer that they *might* accept. \n4.  **First Offer:** I'll start by offering player 2 a fair division of items. Since I have the most value in item 2 and 4, I will take all the item 2 and 4 and distribute the remaining items somewhat evenly. Player 2 will likely have values different than mine, but this strategy is a start.\n    I will keep 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n    That means I'll offer to the other player 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n\n5.  **Counteroffer Calculation:** I will now calculate the value of my remaining items with the above mentioned split.\n    0 units of item 1 = 0 * 18 = 0\n    0 units of item 2 = 0 * 96 = 0\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 * 21 = 63\n    0 units of item 4 = 0 * 86 = 0\n    2 units of item 5 = 2 * 67 = 134\n    Total value = 0 + 0 + 63 + 0 + 134 = 197\n\n6. **Comparing to Outside Option:** My initial offer will have a value of 197 if accepted. This is less than my outside option of 687. Since I value item 2 and 4 so high, I should aim to keep those items as part of the offer and give the other player more of the items I do not value as much. I will revise my offer to give the player more items 1, 3 and 5 and keep more of items 2 and 4.\n\n7. **Revised Offer:** I will keep 0 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n    This means I'll offer to the other player 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n\n8. **Revised Counteroffer Calculation:**\n    0 units of item 1 = 0 * 18 = 0\n    1 units of item 2 = 1 * 96 = 96\n    0 units of item 3 = 0 * 21 = 0\n    1 units of item 4 = 1 * 86 = 86\n    0 units of item 5 = 0 * 67 = 0\n    Total value = 0 + 96 + 0 + 86 + 0 = 182\n\n9.  **Final Counteroffer:** This counteroffer gives me a value of 182. This is still less than my outside offer. I will revise my counter offer and keep as much of the items that I value as possible.\n    I will keep 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n    I will offer the other player 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n\n10. **Final Counteroffer Calculation:**\n    0 units of item 1 = 0 * 18 = 0\n    2 units of item 2 = 2 * 96 = 192\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 * 21 = 63\n    2 units of item 4 = 2 * 86 = 172\n    2 units of item 5 = 2 * 67 = 134\n    Total value = 0 + 192 + 63 + 172 + 134 = 561\n\n11. **Comparing to Outside Option:** The total value of this offer to me is 561. This is still less than my outside option of 687. Since I have the option to walk in any round and guarantee 687, I will choose to walk.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

This is the first round.\n\n**Reasoning for Round 1**\n\n1.  **Calculate total item value**:\n    * Item 1: 5 units * 25 = 125\n    * Item 2: 1 unit * 14 = 14\n    * Item 3: 1 unit * 29 = 29\n    * Item 4: 3 units * 79 = 237\n    * Item 5: 5 units * 61 = 305\n    * Total value = 125 + 14 + 29 + 237 + 305 = 710\n\n2.  **No current offer to accept**.\n\n3. **Initial offer strategy**: Since it's the first round and I want to maximize my value, I should start with an offer that gives Player 2 a reasonable share, but leaves me with more than my outside offer value to account for the discount factor. I do not have any information about Player 2's preferences, therefore an even distribution would be an acceptable starting point. I should also keep in mind that if I do not reach a deal and walk away, I will only get my outside offer, which is lower than my total value of items. Since the other agent has their own private outside offer and their own values per item, we must make an offer that is appealing enough to make them accept instead of walking.\n\n4.  **Propose an even split as a starting point**: Let's see what an even split of items would look like. Note that we must give whole unit numbers and only divide quantities available to us.\n    * Item 1: Player 2 gets 2, I get 3 (25 * 3 = 75)\n    * Item 2: Player 2 gets 0, I get 1 (14 * 1 = 14)\n    * Item 3: Player 2 gets 0, I get 1 (29 * 1 = 29)\n    * Item 4: Player 2 gets 1, I get 2 (79 * 2 = 158)\n    * Item 5: Player 2 gets 2, I get 3 (61 * 3 = 183)\n    \n    My total value = 75 + 14 + 29 + 158 + 183 = 459. This is less than my outside offer.\n\n5.  **Adjust offer to increase my value**: I will offer Player 2 a bit less of the higher value items to ensure that I receive more value than my outside offer. I will offer less of items 4 and 5.\n    * Item 1: Player 2 gets 2, I get 3 (25 * 3 = 75)\n    * Item 2: Player 2 gets 0, I get 1 (14 * 1 = 14)\n    * Item 3: Player 2 gets 0, I get 1 (29 * 1 = 29)\n    * Item 4: Player 2 gets 0, I get 3 (79 * 3 = 237)\n    * Item 5: Player 2 gets 2, I get 3 (61 * 3 = 183)\n    \n    My total value = 75 + 14 + 29 + 237 + 183 = 538.\n\n6.  **Second proposed offer**: Since my outside offer is 692, I will aim to have higher total value, taking into account that the other agent may not accept my offer.\n    * Item 1: Player 2 gets 1, I get 4 (25 * 4 = 100)\n    * Item 2: Player 2 gets 0, I get 1 (14 * 1 = 14)\n    * Item 3: Player 2 gets 0, I get 1 (29 * 1 = 29)\n    * Item 4: Player 2 gets 0, I get 3 (79 * 3 = 237)\n    * Item 5: Player 2 gets 1, I get 4 (61 * 4 = 244)\n\n    My total value = 100 + 14 + 29 + 237 + 244 = 624. This is less than my outside offer, so I should make a more appealing offer to myself.\n\n7.  **Third proposed offer**: \n    * Item 1: Player 2 gets 1, I get 4 (25 * 4 = 100)\n    * Item 2: Player 2 gets 0, I get 1 (14 * 1 = 14)\n    * Item 3: Player 2 gets 0, I get 1 (29 * 1 = 29)\n    * Item 4: Player 2 gets 0, I get 3 (79 * 3 = 237)\n    * Item 5: Player 2 gets 0, I get 5 (61 * 5 = 305)\n\n    My total value = 100 + 14 + 29 + 237 + 305 = 685\n\n8. **Final offer**\n    * Item 1: Player 2 gets 0, I get 5 (25 * 5 = 125)\n    * Item 2: Player 2 gets 0, I get 1 (14 * 1 = 14)\n    * Item 3: Player 2 gets 0, I get 1 (29 * 1 = 29)\n    * Item 4: Player 2 gets 0, I get 3 (79 * 3 = 237)\n    * Item 5: Player 2 gets 0, I get 5 (61 * 5 = 305)\n\n    My total value = 125 + 14 + 29 + 237 + 305 = 710\n\n**Action**\n\nGiven my analysis, I will offer all items to myself.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best course of action for round 1.\n\n**Understanding the Game**\n\n*   **Goal:** Maximize my discounted value from the negotiation, considering my outside offer.\n*   **My Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 65\n    *   Item 2: 40\n    *   Item 3: 59\n    *   Item 4: 73\n    *   Item 5: 21\n*   **My Outside Offer:** 813\n*   **Items:** 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 8 of item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** 0.9\n*   **Rounds:** 3\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nSince this is round 1 and there is no offer on the table yet, I need to make an initial offer. I cannot accept or walk in the first round if there is no current offer. My goal is to make a counter offer that is beneficial enough to potentially incentivize player 2 to accept in subsequent rounds, while also making sure I'm not accepting less than my outside offer if a deal is made. I also need to take into consideration the discounting factor. I want to achieve a value greater than or equal to my outside offer of 813 after discounting. Since the discount factor is 0.9, the present value of any potential agreement will be discounted by 0.9^(r-1), with r=1, 2, or 3. I will therefore make a conservative offer which aims to achieve a value greater than or equal to 813 without discounting, since my discounted value cannot go up.\n\nA safe strategy would be to offer Player 2 a relatively low value offer. I will aim to keep the majority of higher value items for myself. I will offer player 2 one unit each of item 1, item 3, and item 4, and three units of item 5, and two units of item 2. This is just a starting point to gauge how player 2 might react in the later rounds. My value if this offer is accepted is:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 * 65 = 130\n*   Item 2: 3 * 40 = 120\n*   Item 3: 2 * 59 = 118\n*   Item 4: 2 * 73 = 146\n*   Item 5: 5 * 21 = 105\n*   Total value: 130 + 120 + 118 + 146 + 105 = 619. This is lower than my outside option of 813. I need to give player 2 less and keep more for myself.\n\nLet me propose offering player 2 one unit of each item except for item 5 where I will offer 4 units. This leads to a total for me of:\n*   Item 1: 2 * 65 = 130\n*   Item 2: 4 * 40 = 160\n*   Item 3: 2 * 59 = 118\n*   Item 4: 2 * 73 = 146\n*   Item 5: 4 * 21 = 84\n*   Total Value: 130+160+118+146+84=638 which is still below 813\n\nIf I offer 0 units of items 1-4 and 0 units of item 5, my value is\n*   Item 1: 3 * 65 = 195\n*   Item 2: 5 * 40 = 200\n*   Item 3: 3 * 59 = 177\n*   Item 4: 3 * 73 = 219\n*   Item 5: 8 * 21 = 168\n*   Total Value: 195+200+177+219+168 = 959.\nThis is greater than 813 so it would be acceptable. \n\nLet me make an offer to give Player 2, 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nThen, my value will be:\n*   Item 1: 3 * 65 = 195\n*   Item 2: 3 * 40 = 120\n*   Item 3: 3 * 59 = 177\n*   Item 4: 2 * 73 = 146\n*   Item 5: 5 * 21 = 105\n* Total: 743, which is less than my outside offer.\n\nLet me make an offer to give Player 2, 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\nThen, my value will be:\n*   Item 1: 3 * 65 = 195\n*   Item 2: 4 * 40 = 160\n*   Item 3: 3 * 59 = 177\n*   Item 4: 3 * 73 = 219\n*   Item 5: 8 * 21 = 168\n* Total: 919, which is greater than my outside offer, but not too much.

I will try to keep 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5 for myself. This leaves the following for Player 2:\n* 1 unit of item 1\n* 2 unit of item 2\n* 2 units of item 3\n* 4 units of item 4\n* 3 units of item 5\n\n**Calculating My Value**\n\nMy value for the amount I will retain is:\n\n*   Item 1: 0 * 31 = 0\n*   Item 2: 0 * 26 = 0\n*   Item 3: 2 * 2 = 4\n*   Item 4: 3 * 43 = 129\n*   Item 5: 2 * 90 = 180\n*   Total Value = 0+0+4+129+180 = 313\nMy outside value is 66, so offering a split like this is significantly better for me than my outside offer.\n\n**Action**\n\nI will make a COUNTEROFFER for the other player, which leaves me with a value of 313 if accepted.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 4, 3]}\n```\n",

This is not possible given units must be integer.\n        * Lets try to offer 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5 to player 2, so I keep the rest.\n        *  Keep 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 96 = 192\n        *  Keep 1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 10 = 10\n        * Keep 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 49 = 98\n        * Keep 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 73 = 146\n        * Keep 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 45 = 45\n        *  Total Value = 192 + 10 + 98 + 146 + 45 = 491. This beats the outside offer.\n\n    * Let's make a counter offer that is reasonable given the above calculation.  Offer 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n\n4.  **Initial Counteroffer**\n    Based on the above analysis, a reasonable initial counteroffer would be [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]. This keeps 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5, for a value of 491 to me.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n**Understanding the Game:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Maximize my discounted value, either through a deal or my outside offer.\n*   **Items:** 5 types with specified quantities.\n*   **Private Values:** My values are 22, 45, 94, 46, and 69 for items 1-5, respectively.\n*   **Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 100.\n*   **Discount Factor:**  gamma = 0.9.\n*   **Rounds:** 3 rounds of negotiation.\n*   **Actions:** ACCEPT, COUNTEROFFER, WALK.\n\n**Round 1 Analysis:**\n\n*   There is no offer on the table yet.\n*   Since it is round 1, and I go first, my only action is to either WALK or make an offer.\n*   I should calculate my total value of all items:\n    *   (5 * 22) + (3 * 45) + (2 * 94) + (3 * 46) + (4 * 69) = 110 + 135 + 188 + 138 + 276 = 847\n*  I should make an offer that at least guarantees my outside offer value (100).\n\n*   **Consider a simple offer:** Let's offer half of each item.\n    *   2.5 items of item 1 = 2.5 * 22 = 55\n    *   1.5 items of item 2 = 1.5 * 45 = 67.5\n    *   1 item of item 3 = 1 * 94 = 94\n    *   1.5 items of item 4 = 1.5 * 46 = 69\n    *   2 items of item 5 = 2 * 69 = 138\n    *   Total value = 55 + 67.5 + 94 + 69 + 138 = 423.5\n    This leaves me with:\n     *   2.5 items of item 1 = 2.5 * 22 = 55\n    *   1.5 items of item 2 = 1.5 * 45 = 67.5\n    *   1 item of item 3 = 1 * 94 = 94\n    *   1.5 items of item 4 = 1.5 * 46 = 69\n    *   2 items of item 5 = 2 * 69 = 138\n   Total Value = 55+67.5+94+69+138= 423.5. This is much higher than my outside option.\n*   **Consider another offer:** Let me offer the other player 2 items of item 1, 1 item of item 2, 1 item of item 3, 1 item of item 4 and 2 items of item 5\n    * This would leave me with: \n      * 3 items of item 1 = 3 * 22 = 66\n      * 2 items of item 2 = 2 * 45 = 90\n      * 1 item of item 3 = 1 * 94 = 94\n      * 2 items of item 4 = 2 * 46 = 92\n      * 2 items of item 5 = 2 * 69 = 138\n    Total value is 66+90+94+92+138 = 482 which is much higher than my outside value.\n\nSince I go first, I will make an offer, as it is beneficial for me to try to reach a deal with the other player, since I am currently getting nothing.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 208. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 720 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 4, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 6, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 6, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1 in round 1.\n\n**Understanding the Game:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Maximize my (Player 1's) value, considering my private values and outside offer.\n*   **Private Values:** My values per item are: Item 1: 15, Item 2: 24, Item 3: 23, Item 4: 65, Item 5: 77.\n*   **Item Quantities:** There are 8 of Item 1, 2 of Item 2, 2 of Item 3, 1 of Item 4, and 4 of Item 5.\n*   **Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 546.\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9.\n*   **Rounds:** 3 rounds of negotiation.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nSince I am player 1 and it is round 1, there is no offer on the table. Thus, my options are to walk or to make a counteroffer. A rational counteroffer needs to be something that is better than my outside offer for myself, and something that might be acceptable to Player 2 as well. Because I don't have any information about Player 2's values, I will make an offer which offers them a split which is slightly better for me than half. That is, I keep a bit more than half of the items which have higher values for me, and offer Player 2 slightly less than half.\n\n**Calculating My Total Value**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of all items for me:\n\n*   Item 1: 8 * 15 = 120\n*   Item 2: 2 * 24 = 48\n*   Item 3: 2 * 23 = 46\n*   Item 4: 1 * 65 = 65\n*   Item 5: 4 * 77 = 308\n*   Total Value = 120 + 48 + 46 + 65 + 308 = 587\n\n**Determining a Good Initial Counteroffer**\n\nI will aim to keep slightly more than half of each item (rounding up). Note that because the outside offer is 546, if I keep just over half I will be much better off than the outside offer.\n\n*   **Item 1:** Keep 5, offer 3\n*   **Item 2:** Keep 2, offer 0\n*   **Item 3:** Keep 2, offer 0\n*   **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n*   **Item 5:** Keep 3, offer 1\n\n**Calculating the Value of My Initial Counteroffer**\n\n*   **Item 1:** 5 * 15 = 75\n*   **Item 2:** 2 * 24 = 48\n*   **Item 3:** 2 * 23 = 46\n*   **Item 4:** 1 * 65 = 65\n*  **Item 5:** 3 * 77 = 231\n*   **Total:** 75 + 48 + 46 + 65 + 231 = 465\n\nLet me revise this calculation now to find the value if I keep what i proposed, not what i offer them. This is a more conservative approach but likely better in the long run.\n\n*   **Item 1:** 5 * 15 = 75\n*   **Item 2:** 2 * 24 = 48\n*   **Item 3:** 2 * 23 = 46\n*   **Item 4:** 1 * 65 = 65\n*  **Item 5:** 3 * 77 = 231\n*   **Total:** 75 + 48 + 46 + 65 + 231 = 465\n\nThe value of this is 465, which is less than my outside offer of 546, so I must revise my offer. I will instead offer half of the number of units of each item rounding down.\n\n*   **Item 1:** Keep 4, offer 4\n*   **Item 2:** Keep 1, offer 1\n*   **Item 3:** Keep 1, offer 1\n*   **Item 4:** Keep 0, offer 1\n*   **Item 5:** Keep 2, offer 2\n\nNow lets calculate this.\n\n*   **Item 1:** 4 * 15 = 60\n*   **Item 2:** 1 * 24 = 24\n*   **Item 3:** 1 * 23 = 23\n*   **Item 4:** 0 * 65 = 0\n*  **Item 5:** 2 * 77 = 154\n*   **Total:** 60 + 24 + 23 + 0 + 154 = 261\n\nThis is much less than my outside offer, I need to keep more items.\n\nOkay I will try to create a counteroffer where the value to me is higher than my outside offer. I will try to keep all of Item 4 and most of Item 5, which have the highest values to me, then keep some units of other items as well.\n\n*   **Item 1:** Keep 4, offer 4\n*   **Item 2:** Keep 0, offer 2\n*   **Item 3:** Keep 0, offer 2\n*   **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n*   **Item 5:** Keep 3, offer 1\n*  **Item value:** 4*15 + 0*24 + 0*23 + 1*65 + 3*77 = 60+0+0+65+231 = 356\nThis is still less than my outside offer, I must make a better offer. I will offer 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5. This is because the others have higher values for me.\n\n*   **Item 1:** Keep 5, offer 3\n*   **Item 2:** Keep 1, offer 1\n*   **Item 3:** Keep 1, offer 1\n*   **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n*   **Item 5:** Keep 3, offer 1\n\nValue of this for me: 5 * 15 + 1 * 24 + 1 * 23 + 1 * 65 + 3 * 77 = 75 + 24 + 23 + 65 + 231 = 418\nThis is still less than my outside offer. Lets try keeping more of the high value items, and some of the lower values.\n\n*   **Item 1:** Keep 3, offer 5\n*   **Item 2:** Keep 0, offer 2\n*   **Item 3:** Keep 0, offer 2\n*   **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n*   **Item 5:** Keep 3, offer 1\n\nValue of this for me: 3 * 15 + 0 * 24 + 0 * 23 + 1 * 65 + 3 * 77 = 401\n\nOkay, let's try an approach where I keep more of the high value items.\n\n*   **Item 1:** Keep 3, offer 5\n*   **Item 2:** Keep 0, offer 2\n*   **Item 3:** Keep 0, offer 2\n*   **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n*   **Item 5:** Keep 4, offer 0\nValue: 3 * 15 + 0*24 + 0*23 + 1*65 + 4*77 = 40 + 0 + 0 + 65 + 308 = 413\nStill less than my outside offer, I must keep more items.\n*   **Item 1:** Keep 4, offer 4\n*   **Item 2:** Keep 0, offer 2\n*   **Item 3:** Keep 0, offer 2\n*   **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n*   **Item 5:** Keep 4, offer 0\nValue: 4 * 15 + 0*24 + 0*23 + 1*65 + 4*77 = 60 + 0 + 0 + 65 + 308 = 433\n\nLets try keeping the high value items and some of the medium.\n*   **Item 1:** Keep 4, offer 4\n*   **Item 2:** Keep 1, offer 1\n*   **Item 3:** Keep 0, offer 2\n*   **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n*   **Item 5:** Keep 4, offer 0\nValue: 4*15 + 1*24 + 0*23 + 1*65 + 4*77 = 60 + 24 + 0 + 65 + 308 = 457\n\n*   **Item 1:** Keep 3, offer 5\n*   **Item 2:** Keep 0, offer 2\n*   **Item 3:** Keep 0, offer 2\n*   **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n*   **Item 5:** Keep 4, offer 0\nValue: 3*15 + 0*24 + 0*23 + 1*65 + 4*77 = 413\nStill too low.\n*   **Item 1:** Keep 4, offer 4\n*   **Item 2:** Keep 1, offer 1\n*   **Item 3:** Keep 1, offer 1\n*   **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n*   **Item 5:** Keep 4, offer 0\nValue: 4 * 15 + 1 * 24 + 1 * 23 + 1 * 65 + 4 * 77 = 474\n\n*   **Item 1:** Keep 5, offer 3\n*   **Item 2:** Keep 1, offer 1\n*   **Item 3:** Keep 1, offer 1\n*   **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n*   **Item 5:** Keep 4, offer 0\nValue: 5*15 + 1*24 + 1*23 + 1*65 + 4*77 = 75 + 24 + 23 + 65 + 308 = 495\nLets try another one.\n*   **Item 1:** Keep 5, offer 3\n*   **Item 2:** Keep 2, offer 0\n*   **Item 3:** Keep 2, offer 0\n*   **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n*   **Item 5:** Keep 4, offer 0\nValue = 5*15 + 2*24 + 2*23 + 1*65 + 4*77 = 75 + 48 + 46 + 65 + 308 = 542\nStill too low.\n\nOkay, lets make an offer that is just above the outside offer.\n\n*   **Item 1:** Keep 5, offer 3\n*   **Item 2:** Keep 1, offer 1\n*  **Item 3:** Keep 0, offer 2\n*   **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n*  **Item 5:** Keep 4, offer 0\nValue = 5*15 + 1*24 + 0*23 + 1*65 + 4*77 = 75 + 24 + 0 + 65 + 308 = 472\nStill too low.\n*  **Item 1:** Keep 6, offer 2\n*   **Item 2:** Keep 1, offer 1\n*  **Item 3:** Keep 1, offer 1\n*   **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n*  **Item 5:** Keep 4, offer 0\nValue = 6*15 + 1*24 + 1*23 + 1*65 + 4*77 = 90 + 24 + 23 + 65 + 308 = 510\n*   **Item 1:** Keep 6, offer 2\n*   **Item 2:** Keep 1, offer 1\n*   **Item 3:** Keep 1, offer 1\n*  **Item 4:** Keep 0, offer 1\n*   **Item 5:** Keep 4, offer 0\nValue = 6*15 + 1*24 + 1*23 + 0*65 + 4*77 = 90 + 24 + 23 + 0 + 308 = 445\n*   **Item 1:** Keep 6, offer 2\n*   **Item 2:** Keep 2, offer 0\n*   **Item 3:** Keep 1, offer 1\n*   **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n*   **Item 5:** Keep 4, offer 0\nValue = 6*15 + 2*24 + 1*23 + 1*65 + 4*77 = 90 + 48 + 23 + 65 + 308 = 534\n* **Item 1:** Keep 7, offer 1\n* **Item 2:** Keep 1, offer 1\n* **Item 3:** Keep 1, offer 1\n* **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n* **Item 5:** Keep 4, offer 0\nValue = 7*15 + 1*24 + 1*23 + 1*65 + 4*77 = 105 + 24 + 23 + 65 + 308 = 525\n\nLet's try one more:\n* **Item 1:** Keep 6, offer 2\n* **Item 2:** Keep 0, offer 2\n* **Item 3:** Keep 0, offer 2\n* **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n* **Item 5:** Keep 4, offer 0\nValue = 6*15 + 0*24 + 0*23 + 1*65 + 4*77 = 90 + 0 + 0 + 65 + 308 = 463\nLet's try offering 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\n* **Item 1:** Keep 6, offer 2\n* **Item 2:** Keep 1, offer 1\n* **Item 3:** Keep 2, offer 0\n* **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n* **Item 5:** Keep 4, offer 0\nValue: 6*15 + 1*24 + 2*23 + 1*65 + 4*77 = 90 + 24 + 46 + 65 + 308 = 533\n\nOkay, I am confident I will make the offer.\n* **Item 1:** Keep 7, offer 1\n* **Item 2:** Keep 1, offer 1\n* **Item 3:** Keep 1, offer 1\n* **Item 4:** Keep 1, offer 0\n* **Item 5:** Keep 4, offer 0\nValue: 7*15 + 1*24 + 1*23 + 1*65 + 4*77 = 105 + 24 + 23 + 65 + 308 = 525\nI will accept this and offer it.\n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This means a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the undiscounted value, and round 3 is 0.81.\n*   **Round Structure:**  3 rounds, alternating moves. Last round is treated as a walk if counteroffer is made.\n*   **No Offer Yet:**  There's no offer on the table yet, meaning Player 2 has not made an offer.\n\n**Strategy Considerations:**\n\n*   **Round 1 Goal:** As the first mover, the initial offer is completely up to me. I want to propose a deal that will be acceptable to the other player while also being beneficial to me (relative to my outside offer) and taking the discount into account for future rounds.\n*   **Optimal Offer:** Given that I have no information about Player 2, an optimal initial offer is going to be based around splitting the items in some way that is beneficial to me based on my values. Giving myself more of the high-value items (2 and 1) and giving less of the low value items (3 and 4), would be a reasonable way to proceed.\n*   **Avoiding Walking:** Walking away initially is a suboptimal strategy as I would take the outside offer immediately without exploring a potential deal.\n*   **Aggressive vs. Cautious:**  I could try to make an offer that gives me a large share, but this could be rejected by Player 2. I could make a more generous offer in an attempt to secure a deal right away. With 3 rounds available I will make an aggressive initial offer.\n\n**Calculating an Initial Counteroffer:**\n\nLet's start by trying a relatively aggressive offer that still leaves me with more of the higher valued items, but doesn't give the other player a terrible deal. This is what Player 2 will receive:\n* Item 1: 1 units\n* Item 2: 1 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 0 units\n* Item 5: 2 units\n\nThe values of the items are:\n* 3 units of Item 1 for me: 3 * 69 = 207\n* 2 units of Item 2 for me: 2 * 92 = 184\n* 3 units of Item 3 for me: 3 * 15 = 45\n* 2 units of Item 4 for me: 2 * 19 = 38\n* 3 units of Item 5 for me: 3 * 44 = 132\n* Total = 207 + 184 + 45 + 38 + 132 = 606\n\nThis is much greater than my outside offer of 310, so this offer is worth considering.\n\n**Action:**\n\nBased on the above, I will make the following counteroffer: I will offer Player 2 one unit of item 1, one unit of item 2, two units of item 3, zero units of item 4, and two units of item 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]}\n```\n",

I cannot accept or walk away at this point. The objective is to maximize my outcome given my outside option, which I can always revert back to if the negotiation goes poorly. The discounted total value of any offer has to be higher than 1321, to be worth pursuing a deal.\nI want to propose a deal that will most likely be accepted in Round 2 or Round 3 by player 2. In order to maximize the total value of the deal, it needs to at least be greater than my outside value of 1321.

This is my guaranteed fallback value.\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.9, which means the value decreases in later rounds.\n*   **Negotiation Rounds:** We have 3 rounds of negotiation.\n*   **Goal:** Maximize my discounted value, but never less than my outside option value of 766.\n\n**Round 1 Analysis**\n\nSince it's round 1, I don't have an offer on the table to accept, and I have to initiate the negotiation with an offer. I must also choose an offer that is better than my outside option value of 766.\n\nHere's my calculation for the total value of all items to me:\n(6 * 58) + (3 * 6) + (4 * 92) + (3 * 26) + (4 * 51) = 348 + 18 + 368 + 78 + 204 = 1016\n\nIf I were to propose an even split, I would offer Player 2 half of each item (rounding down for the items that are in odd numbers):\n\n*   Item 1: 3\n*   Item 2: 1\n*   Item 3: 2\n*   Item 4: 1\n*   Item 5: 2\n\nMy value for this outcome is:\n(3 * 58) + (2 * 6) + (2 * 92) + (2 * 26) + (2 * 51) = 174 + 12 + 184 + 52 + 102= 524\n\nGiven that an even split isn't better than my outside option, I will calculate a proposal for Player 2 that would give me at least 766.\n\nSince I have total value of 1016, if I was to keep 766, I would offer player 2 an item value totaling 250.\nI will give player 2:\n\nitem 1: 1 unit. value to me: 58.\nitem 2: 1 unit, value to me 6.\nitem 3: 1 unit, value to me 92.\nitem 4: 1 unit, value to me 26.\nitem 5: 1 unit, value to me 51.\ntotal value to me: 233\nIf I also give player 2 1 unit of item 3, then the total value to me is 233+92= 325.\nLets start with that offer:\nitem 1: 1 unit.\nitem 2: 1 unit.\nitem 3: 2 unit.\nitem 4: 1 unit.\nitem 5: 1 unit.\n\nMy value for this outcome is:\n(5 * 58) + (2 * 6) + (2 * 92) + (2 * 26) + (3 * 51) = 290 + 12 + 184 + 52 + 153 = 693 + 108 = 711\nThis is less than 766, I will keep looking for a better offer.\n\nitem 1: 0\nitem 2: 0\nitem 3: 1\nitem 4: 0\nitem 5: 0\nMy value: (6 * 58) + (3 * 6) + (3 * 92) + (3 * 26) + (4 * 51) = 348 + 18 + 276 + 78 + 204 = 924\nvalue to player 2: (1 * 92) = 92\ntotal value: 1016 = 924 + 92\nThis is not greater than my outside value of 766\n\nI need to generate an offer that is greater than my outside option.\nI am going to try to give away as little as possible of item 3, as I value it the highest.\nOffer:\nitem 1: 2 units (116)\nitem 2: 1 unit (6)\nitem 3: 0 units (0)\nitem 4: 0 units (0)\nitem 5: 1 unit (51)\nThis is a value of 116+6+51 = 173 to player 2.\nThis means I have a value of 1016 - 173= 843.\n843 > 766 so this is a valid offer to player 2.\n\n**Action**\n\nTherefore, my action is to make a counteroffer that gives player 2 the following:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n",

I will therefore propose a counter offer to ensure that I am not stuck with less than 802. To get close to 802, I will offer a little less than half to player 1, by assuming that they will be happy with an outcome over their outside option and are also trying to maximise their overall returns. I will therefore offer them half of item 1 and half of items 2 and 5, nothing from items 3 and 4.\nSo I will offer player 1: [3,1,0,0,2]\nThis means I keep: [3,2,4,3,2]\n* 3 units of item 1: 3 * 46 = 138\n* 2 units of item 2: 2 * 65 = 130\n* 4 units of item 3: 4 * 50 = 200\n* 3 units of item 4: 3 * 52 = 156\n* 2 units of item 5: 2 * 9 = 18\nTotal Value = 642.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Round:** 2\n*   **Current Offer to Me:** [1, 2, 0, 0, 0] (This means Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.)\n*   **My Values:** [46, 65, 50, 52, 9] (My values per unit for items 1 through 5)\n*   **My Outside Offer:** 802\n*   **Discount Factor (gamma):** 0.9\n*   **Previous Offers:**\n    *   Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n    *   Round 1: I offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    *   Round 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n**Evaluating the Current Offer:**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n\n*   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 46 = 46\n*   2 units of item 2: 2 * 65 = 130\n*   0 units of item 3: 0 * 50 = 0\n*   0 units of item 4: 0 * 52 = 0\n*   0 units of item 5: 0 * 9 = 0\n\nTotal value of current offer: 46 + 130 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 176\n\nNow, let's apply the discount factor for round 2, where r = 2:\nPresent value of current offer: 176 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 176 * 0.9 = 158.4\n\n**Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n\nMy outside offer is 802.  The discounted value of the current offer (158.4) is significantly less than my outside offer (802).\n\n**Counteroffer Strategy**\n\nMy outside offer is 802, and the value of the deal would be subject to a discount factor. At this stage, it seems very unlikely that an offer from Player 1 would be better than walking away, so I should consider a counteroffer which maximizes my value to the greatest extent possible given that it is only round 2.\n\nI have 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 4 units of item 5.\nMy values per item are 46, 65, 50, 52, 9. So, given that I am trying to maximize my value, item 2 is the highest value, followed by item 4, 3, 1 and 5.\nSince Player 1 has already been given 1 unit of item 1 and 2 units of item 2, it would be best for me to attempt to get those back. In round 1 they offered 2,1,0,0,1, and I offered 1,0,0,0,0. I should try and get back at least that much. I will ask for the rest of item 2, 1 and then even item 4.\nLet's try offering Player 1 [0,0,0,0,0].\nThis would mean I get 6,3,4,3,4.\n6*46 + 3*65 + 4*50 + 3*52 + 4*9 = 276 + 195 + 200 + 156 + 36 = 863.\nThen discounted this would be 863 * 0.9 = 776.7. Still less than my outside offer.\n\nSo let's try [1,0,0,0,0].\nThis would mean I get 5,3,4,3,4\n5*46 + 3*65 + 4*50 + 3*52 + 4*9 = 230 + 195 + 200 + 156 + 36 = 817.\nDiscounted, this would be 817*0.9 = 735.3\nStill less.\n\nI will now try an offer that values my high value items\nLet's offer 1,1,0,0,0\nThen I get 5,2,4,3,4\n230 + 130 + 200 + 156 + 36 = 752.\nDiscounted, 752*0.9 = 676.8, still less.\n\nLet's offer 0,0,0,0,0.\nMy value will be 863 * 0.9 = 776.7, still less.\nI should try to get close to my outside offer.\n\nLet's try an offer to keep most high value items [0,0,1,1,1].\nThis gives me 6,3,3,2,3\n6*46 + 3*65 + 3*50 + 2*52 + 3*9 = 276 + 195 + 150 + 104 + 27 = 752\n752 * 0.9 = 676.8\n\nLet's go back to offering [1,0,0,0,0] as a counteroffer which gives me 735.3.\nThis might be a good strategy, since it improves on the previous offer to me and is significantly above the previous offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Therefore, the value to me is:\n1 * 56 + 1 * 49 + 1 * 40 + 1 * 3 + 1 * 58 = 206\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the discounted value of the current offer.**\n\nSince this is round 2, we need to discount the value of the offer by gamma^(round - 1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nDiscounted value = 206 * 0.9 = 185.4\n\n**Step 3: Compare the discounted value to my outside offer.**\n\nThe discounted value of the current offer (185.4) is significantly greater than my outside offer (33). Therefore, walking away is not a good option.\n\n**Step 4: Consider making a counteroffer.**\nThe previous offer I gave to the player 2 in round 1 was [1,1,2,1,1]. This means I was keeping:\n[3-1,3-1,4-2,3-1,2-1] = [2,2,2,2,1]\nWhich is valued at:\n2*56 + 2*49 + 2*40 + 2*3 + 1*58 = 112 + 98 + 80 + 6 + 58 = 354\nAnd the offer to player 2 was worth\n1*56 + 1*49 + 2*40 + 1*3 + 1*58 = 56 + 49 + 80 + 3 + 58 = 246\n\nIn round 1 player 2 offered me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].  This is exactly what I am receiving.  It is likely that player 2 values these items less than I do so there may be a possible improvement for me. I should look at offering player 2 their preferred item, number 5, if I offer less than they think they can get in round 3, they may choose to accept, increasing my value more than accepting the current offer. Let us give them two of item 5. This means that I will get:\n[3,3,4,3,0]\nand the value will be:\n3*56 + 3*49 + 4*40 + 3*3 + 0*58 = 168 + 147 + 160 + 9 + 0 = 484. This is much better than my discounted current value of 185.4, and still much better after discounting. This will mean player 2 receives [0,0,0,0,2]. I will then calculate an expected value for them in round 3.\n\nDiscounted value for player 2: 484*0.9 = 435.6\n\n**Step 5: Determine the optimal action.**\n\nGiven that the discounted value of accepting the current offer is 185.4 and the value from making a counteroffer of [0,0,0,0,2] is 435.6, I should make the counteroffer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 33. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 618 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

My outside offer is 33. The current offer on the table is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means I get all of the items.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of accepting the current offer:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 units * 56 = 168\n*   Item 2: 3 units * 49 = 147\n*   Item 3: 4 units * 40 = 160\n*   Item 4: 3 units * 3 = 9\n*   Item 5: 2 units * 58 = 116\n*   Total value = 168 + 147 + 160 + 9 + 116 = 600\n\nSince this is the last round, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\nSo, the discounted value of accepting the current offer is 600 * 0.81 = 486.\n\nNow let's compare the discounted value of accepting the current offer (486) with my outside offer (33).

Therefore, I should consider this offer and potentially make a counteroffer rather than walk away.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nSince this is round 2, there is one more round remaining. Accepting the current offer is tempting, as it is already much better than my outside offer of 93. However, making a counteroffer has a potential upside. If I can make a counteroffer that Player 1 accepts, this may give me a greater total value, since in the final round, if I make a counteroffer this will be treated as a walk, and I get my outside option.\n\nMy previous offer was [0, 3, 0, 0, 4], so I think my best strategy is to ask for the items that I value the most, while giving Player 1 the items they asked for previously. Therefore I'll offer them [2, 0, 1, 1, 4] to player 1, keeping the rest for myself.\n\n**Counteroffer Calculation**\nIf I propose [2, 0, 1, 1, 4] this means that I keep:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 6 units\nItem 3: 2 units\nItem 4: 1 unit\nItem 5: 3 units\nTotal value: (1 * 97) + (6 * 14) + (2 * 76) + (1 * 37) + (3 * 2) = 97 + 84 + 152 + 37 + 6 = 376\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 1, 4]}\n```\n",

It should be aggressive enough so that I am not immediately walking away with my outside offer, but I want to make a reasonable starting offer to avoid a walk by player 2. I have to keep in mind that this offer also must have a greater value for myself than my outside option value of 712.\nI will offer half the items to player 2 where possible since no information about player 2's preferences is available. This strategy should at least secure me a large enough value for my overall game.\n\nLet's calculate the value of such an offer:\n* I keep 2 units of item 1: 2 * 53 = 106\n* I keep 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 86 = 86\n* I keep 2 units of item 3: 2 * 64 = 128\n* I keep 2 units of item 4: 2 * 72 = 144\n* I keep 3 units of item 5: 3 * 2 = 6\nTotal Value = 106 + 86 + 128 + 144 + 6 = 470\nMy value for keeping the rest (and offering the other half to player 2) is 470. This value is less than my outside offer, so I will offer player 2 less. I need to offer such that I will keep at least 712 of value.\n\nLets consider an offer that gives player 2 only 1 unit each, apart from item 5. This means I will keep:\n*3 of item 1: 3 * 53 = 159\n*2 of item 2: 2 * 86 = 172\n*3 of item 3: 3 * 64 = 192\n*4 of item 4: 4 * 72 = 288\n*6 of item 5: 6 * 2 = 12\nTotal Value = 159 + 172 + 192 + 288 + 12 = 823\nThis is greater than my outside offer, so I will propose this offer. The offer will consist of sending 1 unit each to player 2 for all items except for item 5 which will only be sent 1.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

Since my values for item 3 and 5 are much higher than item 1,2 and 4, I will attempt to secure the lion's share of these items. I also need to ensure my offer will be better than my outside option.\n\nI will offer Player 2 the following:\n\n*   Item 1: 1 unit (leaving me with 2)\n*   Item 2: 3 units (leaving me with 4)\n*   Item 3: 2 units (leaving me with 4)\n*   Item 4: 1 unit (leaving me with 1)\n*   Item 5: 2 units (leaving me with 4)\n\nLet's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n* Item 1: 2 * 31 = 62\n* Item 2: 4 * 26 = 104\n* Item 3: 4 * 86 = 344\n* Item 4: 1 * 19 = 19\n* Item 5: 4 * 100 = 400\nTotal Value = 62 + 104 + 344 + 19 + 400 = 929\n\nSince this offer value is greater than my outside offer of 867, and is a reasonably fair initial split I will start with this offer.\n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 2, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

Ideally, I want to maximize my payoff.\nLet's first calculate a counter offer that would give me at least 434 / 0.9 =  482.22, which is the minimum pre-discounted value I need to obtain for this deal to be better than walking away.\n\nLet's try an offer to Player 1 that gives them an equal amount of all items (or as close to equal as possible).\nPlayer 1 gets [1, 3, 3, 1, 3]\nThen I get [2, 4, 3, 1, 3].\nMy value for this is:\n2*63+4*3+3*80+1*7+3*39=126+12+240+7+117=502\n\n502 * 0.9 = 451.8 > 434\nThis deal is good for me.\n\n**My Action**\n\nBased on my analysis, I should make the counteroffer [1, 3, 3, 1, 3].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 3, 1, 3]}\n```\n",

I need to make an offer that, if accepted (or improved upon reasonably) will give me more value than my outside offer of 412, taking the discount into account across 3 rounds.\n\nA simple approach is to first calculate the value I'd get if I kept *everything*.\n * Total value of items if I kept all of them: (3 * 8) + (4 * 85) + (2 * 97) + (5 * 47) + (3 * 57) = 24 + 340 + 194 + 235 + 171 = 964.\n\nThe value I get if I walk away is 412. Since this is round 1, and I only make the first offer, the discount rate doesn't apply to this round, but it does affect my evaluation of future rounds.\nA good starting point is to offer roughly half of the total value to the other player, so as to give myself a greater chance of obtaining a deal that is better than my outside offer. \n\nHere is my proposed counteroffer. It tries to divide the items relatively evenly between me and player 2.\n * Offer 2 units of item 1\n * Offer 2 units of item 2\n * Offer 1 unit of item 3\n * Offer 3 units of item 4\n * Offer 1 unit of item 5\nLet's calculate the value to me of this counteroffer:\n* Item 1: 1 * 8 = 8\n* Item 2: 2 * 85 = 170\n* Item 3: 1 * 97 = 97\n* Item 4: 2 * 47 = 94\n* Item 5: 2 * 57 = 114\n* Total value = 8 + 170 + 97 + 94 + 114 = 483\nThis value is already above my outside offer and so it is better than walking away. Note that if the other player accepts this offer in round 1, I get 483. If it was accepted in round 2, I get 483 * 0.9 = 434.7. If it was accepted in round 3, I get 483 * 0.81 = 391.23.\nSo this is a good initial offer to make.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 3, 1]}\n```\n",

For item types with an odd quantity, I will offer the rounded down amount to the other player, and keep the remaining amount for myself.\nSo this would be giving away:\n*   Item 1: 4 units\n*   Item 2: 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 1 unit\n*   Item 4: 1 unit\n*   Item 5: 2 units\n\nAnd keep:\n* Item 1: 4 units\n* Item 2: 1 unit\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 1 units\n* Item 5: 2 units\n\nThis has a value of:\n(4*11) + (1*60) + (2*65) + (1*26) + (2*65) = 44 + 60 + 130 + 26 + 130 = 390\n\nSince this is significantly less than my outside offer of 615, I need to offer the other player much less.\n\nI will make a low-ball offer, giving the other player only one unit of each item except item 1, where I will give away 2:\n\nOffer to player 2: [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nMy remaining items: [6, 1, 2, 1, 3]\n\nMy value is:\n(6*11) + (1*60) + (2*65) + (1*26) + (3*65) = 66 + 60 + 130 + 26 + 195 = 477. This is still below my outside offer of 615, but since it's round 1, if I get the game to round 2 and get an agreement then my discount factor would be 0.9, so my value would be 477 * 0.9 = 429, less than my outside offer, so this is not a good idea.\n\nInstead, I will try to get as close to half of my total value as possible (715/2 = 357.5), which I can get by keeping most of item 5. The best way to accomplish this and still potentially get a deal, is to give:\n* Item 1: 1\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 1\n\nMy value with this:\n(7*11) + (2*60) + (3*65) + (2*26) + (3*65) = 77 + 120 + 195 + 52 + 195 = 639. This is higher than my outside offer of 615, so this is a valid move.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

The value is multiplied by \u03b3^(r-1), where r is the round the deal is made.\n*   **Rounds:** 3 rounds of negotiation.\n*   **My Actions:** Walk, Accept (later rounds), or Counteroffer.\n*   **Player 2 Actions:** Walk, Accept, or Counteroffer.\n\n**Round 1 Strategy**\n\nSince this is round 1 and there's no current offer, I must either walk or make a counteroffer. I cannot accept anything, as there is nothing on the table.  I want to make a reasonable offer that is appealing enough for player 2 to at least consider. If I make an outrageous offer, they may walk immediately.  Let's start by considering a 50/50 split, but rounding some units to maintain whole unit numbers for each item.\n\n**Calculating a Potential Initial Offer**\n\nI want to make an offer that is roughly equivalent to 50% of the value, but rounding as we can only offer whole units. I will start by considering what a 50/50 split would look like:\n* **Item 1:** I keep 1, offer 1.\n* **Item 2:** I keep 1, offer 1.\n* **Item 3:** I keep 1, offer 0.\n* **Item 4:** I keep 3, offer 2.\n* **Item 5:** I keep 3, offer 3.\n\nNow let's calculate the value of this to me:\n*   Item 1: 1 * 50 = 50\n*   Item 2: 1 * 71 = 71\n*   Item 3: 1 * 40 = 40\n*   Item 4: 3 * 32 = 96\n*   Item 5: 3 * 98 = 294\n*   Total Value: 50 + 71 + 40 + 96 + 294 = 551.\n\nThis is much larger than my outside offer. This is likely enough of an offer to get this negotiation started and at least move past round 1.\n\nI'll offer the following units to Player 2:\n*   1 unit of item 1\n*   1 unit of item 2\n*   0 unit of item 3\n*   2 unit of item 4\n*   3 unit of item 5\n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 2, 3]}\n```\n",

This value is better than accepting the current offer.\n\nWe should counteroffer to maximize our value. Let's make a counter offer that leaves a small benefit to player 2 that may be just enough for them to accept it.\n\n**Optimal Counteroffer**\nWe can offer Player 2 a minimum amount of each item such that they might still be inclined to accept it, while still significantly improving our outcome. Since our best value is the full value of 1030.\nIf we offer [0,0,0,0,0] this will certainly be rejected. So lets offer them the minimum of each item possible.\nLets offer the other player [1,1,1,1,1].\nThis means that we get:\n* Item 1: 1 * 50 = 50\n* Item 2: 1 * 71 = 71\n* Item 3: 0 * 40 = 0\n* Item 4: 4 * 32 = 128\n* Item 5: 5 * 98 = 490\nTotal: 739. Discounted by 0.9 is 665.1. Which is better than accepting the current offer.\n\n**Action:**\nSince 665.1 > 459.9 > 130, we should make our counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 656. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 4, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 4, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Round:** 1\n*   **My Role:** Player 2\n*   **My Values:** Item 1: 9, Item 2: 16, Item 3: 65, Item 4: 93, Item 5: 36\n*   **My Outside Offer:** 656\n*   **Player 1's Offer (to me):** [4, 4, 2, 2, 1]\n*   **Total Items:** Item 1: 8, Item 2: 8, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount Factor:** 0.9\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the value of the current offer to me.**\n\nPlayer 1 is offering me:\n* 4 units of item 1\n* 4 units of item 2\n* 2 units of item 3\n* 2 units of item 4\n* 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy value for these items is:\n\n*   Item 1: 4 * 9 = 36\n*   Item 2: 4 * 16 = 64\n*   Item 3: 2 * 65 = 130\n*   Item 4: 2 * 93 = 186\n*   Item 5: 1 * 36 = 36\n    \nTotal value of Player 1's offer to me: 36 + 64 + 130 + 186 + 36 = 452\n\n**Step 2: Compare the value of the current offer with my outside offer.**\n\nMy outside offer is worth 656. The current offer from Player 1 is worth 452.  Since 452 < 656, the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n**Step 3: Determine my action.**\n\nSince the current offer is not beneficial, and this is round 1, I should make a counter offer.\n\nI can create a counter offer that is better for me. A reasonable counteroffer is to ask for what gives me the most value for each of the items I care about. I should try and keep the more highly valued items for myself.\n\n* Item 1 : Value for me is 9, value for player 1 is unknown.\n* Item 2 : Value for me is 16, value for player 1 is unknown.\n* Item 3 : Value for me is 65, value for player 1 is unknown.\n* Item 4 : Value for me is 93, value for player 1 is unknown.\n* Item 5 : Value for me is 36, value for player 1 is unknown.\n\nThe best counteroffer for me would be one where I get the items with the highest individual value. So I should ask to keep as much of items 3, 4 and 5 as possible, and only offer player 1 items 1 and 2.  Let us offer all of the low value items to player 1 and keep the rest. So offer player 1 5 of item 1 and 5 of item 2. This leaves 3 of item 1 for me, 3 of item 2 for me, 5 of item 3 for me, 4 of item 4 for me, 3 of item 5 for me.\n\n**Step 4: Prepare my counteroffer**\n\nI will offer Player 1 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 5, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

I cannot accept anything yet.\n2.  **Considering a Counteroffer:** I need to make a strategic first offer. My goal is to get as much value for myself as possible, but also leave enough for Player 2 to accept a deal rather than walk away.\n\n    *   I will want to keep most of the items I value the highest.\n    *   Let me first calculate my total value for all items:\n        4 * 44 + 4 * 31 + 4 * 19 + 7 * 17 + 9 * 39 = 176 + 124 + 76 + 119 + 351 = 846\n\n3.  **Strategic Offer:** As this is round 1, I should not offer too much to player 2. Player 2 has 3 possible actions, accept, walk or counteroffer. If I give too much to player 2, they might think they can get an even better deal in the next round. If I give too little, they are likely to walk. Therefore, I must try to strike a balance. Let's try offering Player 2 slightly more than half of each item, keeping slightly less for myself. The intention is that this gives a high value to me while encouraging Player 2 to continue negotiations.\n    Offer:\n        Item 1: 2\n        Item 2: 2\n        Item 3: 2\n        Item 4: 4\n        Item 5: 5\n    This leaves me with:\n        Item 1: 2\n        Item 2: 2\n        Item 3: 2\n        Item 4: 3\n        Item 5: 4\n    My value for this is:\n        2 * 44 + 2 * 31 + 2 * 19 + 3 * 17 + 4 * 39 = 88 + 62 + 38 + 51 + 156 = 395\n    Since this is greater than my outside offer of 296, I will not walk and am willing to make the offer.\n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 4, 5]}\n```\n",

We could accept, but we could also try to get a better offer. \n*   Let's consider a counteroffer.  A fair split might be to split each item as close to half as we can, with the knowledge that we can always fall back on our outside option and there are two more rounds.\n* Player 1 offered me [2, 2, 2, 4, 5].

This is exactly what player 1 offered, so we could try to extract more value from player 1. We are not guaranteed to get what we ask for in our counter offer.\n* Let's try asking for a larger proportion of the more valuable items (2 and 5). We could ask for [1, 1, 1, 2, 3] to give player 1. This would give us [3, 3, 3, 5, 6] with a value of 72 + 291 + 84 + 65 + 444 = 956, which is quite good but perhaps unlikely to be accepted.\n* Let's try to extract a bit more, asking to give player 1 [1, 1, 1, 3, 4]. The remaining units for Player 2 would be [3,3,3,4,5], valued at 72+291+84+52+370 = 869 which is significantly higher than the current offer, but perhaps still has a decent chance of acceptance by Player 1.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is better than the outside offer, but it's the first round, and we can make a counteroffer, let's make a counteroffer that tries to extract more value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 3, 4]}\n```\n",

Given I do not know Player 2's values, I should try to capture most of the value for myself if possible. My best outcome is to get all the items, which is 467.\n3.  **Considering a counteroffer:** I'll construct a counteroffer that aims to leave player 2 just enough to get a deal in the future but that heavily favors me. Let's offer 0 units of each item in each round. This means I keep everything and Player 2 gets nothing. However, they have some value that could be better than their outside offer and in round 2 might be better than 0.\n\n4.  **Calculate value of the counteroffer to me:**\n    *   My value of 2 units of item 1: 2 * 78 = 156\n    *   My value of 6 units of item 2: 6 * 6 = 36\n    *   My value of 2 units of item 3: 2 * 23 = 46\n    *   My value of 2 units of item 4: 2 * 38 = 76\n    *   My value of 3 units of item 5: 3 * 51 = 153\n    *   Total value of counteroffer to me: 156 + 36 + 46 + 76 + 153 = 467\n5. **Compare to outside offer:** My value for this is 467, while my outside offer is 287. This is clearly better.\n\n**Action:**\n\nBased on the above reasoning, I will make a counteroffer where I keep all of the items and Player 2 gets 0 of each item.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

The current offer is worth 530 to me.  Since my outside offer is better, it would be foolish for me to accept this offer in round 1.\n\n**Counteroffer Strategy:**\n\nIt is early in the negotiation so I won't walk away yet. I will attempt to get a better deal by making a counteroffer, taking into account the discount factor. It's advantageous to try for the highest possible deal first because if the other player declines there is more time for both of us to reach an agreement and get the full un-discounted deal value. Since my outside option is 664, I would not accept an offer worth less than 664 / 0.9 = 737.78 on round 2 and 664/0.81 = 819.75 on round 3. I will offer the other player the minimum of every item, giving me everything possible, in the hopes they will agree, which will allow me to get the full discounted amount.\n\n**My Counteroffer:**\n\nI will offer Player 1 the minimum of 1 unit for each item.\n*   Item 1: 1\n*   Item 2: 1\n*   Item 3: 1\n*   Item 4: 1\n*   Item 5: 1\n\nThis means I keep 5 units of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 6 of item 4, and 4 of item 5, which has a value of (5*15 + 3*2 + 4*81 + 6*38 + 4*23) = 75 + 6 + 324 + 228 + 92 = 725, well above my outside offer value.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

The discounted value of the current offer (221.4) is significantly lower than my outside offer.  Therefore, accepting the current offer is not beneficial.\n\n**Potential Counteroffers and Logic**\n\nSince the current offer is not good, I need to consider making a counteroffer. We have 6 units of item 1, 4 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 7 of item 4, and 5 of item 5.\nRemember, in the last round, if Player 2 counters, I will have no chance to respond - in effect I would have walked away.\n\nSince the current offer is terrible and the round is not the last round (so there's an opportunity to negotiate), I should make a more reasonable counteroffer than I did in round 1, aiming to get closer to my optimal outcome. My optimal outcome would be to keep most of the items.\n\nGiven my private values (especially the high values for items 1, 4 and 5), I need to ensure I retain a good portion of items of type 1, 4 and 5. As my initial offer was too generous, I will make a new offer where I keep most of those.\nI will offer 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 units of item 5. This is better than the current offer for me and gives a better chance of a future agreement.\n\n**Calculate value of the counteroffer to me**\nI would keep 4 units of item 1: 4 * 81 = 324\nI would keep 3 units of item 2: 3 * 3 = 9\nI would keep 4 units of item 3: 4 * 10 = 40\nI would keep 5 units of item 4: 5 * 54 = 270\nI would keep 4 units of item 5: 4 * 98 = 392\nTotal value = 324 + 9 + 40 + 270 + 392 = 1035\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven the above calculations:\n*   Accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n*   The potential counteroffer yields a value of 1035.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer with a better item allocation that is still reasonable for Player 2 and will result in a value over my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

My outside offer is 407. Since 382 < 407, accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIt is round 1, so the current offer of 382 is not yet adjusted by discount factor.  I want to maximize my value, so I must at least match my outside offer of 407. Since the current offer value (382) is less than my outside offer value (407), I should make a counteroffer that exceeds 407 after it is subject to the discount factor in subsequent round (gamma of 0.9). Since I am making a counteroffer and this is round 1, I don't need to discount it by gamma. If the next round offer from player 1 is less than 407/0.9 = 452.22, then walking is the better option for me, assuming I accept on that round. Therefore, we need to make a counteroffer that at least approaches that amount. My overall value of all the items is 803. If I offer player 1 half of each of the items, keeping half for myself, the value of those items to me would be (4/2)*13 + (2/2)*95 + (4/2)*9 + (5/2)*39 + (6/2)*55 = 26+95+18+97.5+165= 401.5 . This would be insufficient. If I offer them less, I might get more. Let's see if we can hit 452. The current value of player 1's offer to me is 382, so i need 70 more value to get to my outside offer. Let's make a counteroffer that gives player 1: 1 of item 1 (value 13), 0 of item 2 (value 95), 1 of item 3 (value 9), 1 of item 4 (value 39), 2 of item 5 (value 55), since item 2 is my highest value, I should avoid giving more away. This yields a value to me of 3*13+2*95+3*9+4*39+4*55 = 39 + 190 + 27 + 156 + 220 = 632. Since this is greater than 452, I'll make this offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

This means, accepting the current offer provides better value than walking away at this point.\n\n**Step 4: Consider making a counter offer**\n\nBefore accepting we should consider whether there is any counter offer that will give us more value.\nLet us first consider the offer made by player 1 in the first round: [2, 1, 2, 2, 3]. If we obtain this now, the value is calculated as follows:\n* Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2 * 6 = 12\n* Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 * 65 = 65\n* Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2 * 34 = 68\n* Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3 * 59 = 177\n* Item 5: 6 - 3 = 3 * 32 = 96\n* Total Value = 12 + 65 + 68 + 177 + 96 = 418\nThe discounted value is 418 * 0.9 = 376.2\nThis is significantly greater than the discounted value of the current offer of 146.7.\nLet us make a counter offer of [2, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 2, 3]}\n```\n",

Therefore, accepting the current offer is not a good move.\n\n**Consider a Counteroffer:**\nSince the current offer is not acceptable, and we are in round 1, we should make a counteroffer. The goal is to maximize our value. A good counteroffer would be one where the majority of items that we value highly are given to us, while the ones that are valued lower can be given to the opponent. We value items 3, 1, and 4 the most. Therefore, a good counteroffer would give a larger portion of items 1, 3, and 4 to us while we allow the opponent to have more of items 2 and 5. As such, lets offer Player 1: [0, 4, 1, 2, 1]. This means player 2 will keep [2,1,7,7,6].\n\nLet's calculate the value to us of keeping [2,1,7,7,6]:\n* 2 units of item 1: 2 * 73 = 146\n* 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 33 = 33\n* 7 units of item 3: 7 * 95 = 665\n* 7 units of item 4: 7 * 66 = 462\n* 6 units of item 5: 6 * 48 = 288\nTotal Value = 146 + 33 + 665 + 462 + 288 = 1594\n\nSince our outside offer is 1549 and the calculated value is 1594, this counteroffer is an improvement.\n\n**Action:**\n\nBased on the analysis, Player 2 should make the counteroffer calculated above.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze this negotiation problem step by step.\n\n**Understanding the Game**\n\n*   **Objective:** Maximize my discounted value from the negotiation, considering my outside offer.\n*   **Items:** 3 units of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n*   **My Values:** 49 (item 1), 15 (item 2), 13 (item 3), 30 (item 4), 43 (item 5). Total value: 3 * 49 + 1 * 15 + 1 * 13 + 2 * 30 + 2 * 43 = 147 + 15 + 13 + 60 + 86 = 321\n*   **My Outside Offer:** 230.\n*   **Discount Factor:** 0.9 per round.\n*   **Rounds:** 3 rounds max.\n\n**Round 1 Analysis**\n\nSince this is round 1, there's no offer on the table, so I cannot ACCEPT. I must decide whether to WALK away or make a COUNTEROFFER.\n\n*   **WALK Option:** If I walk away now, I receive my outside offer value, which is 230.\n*   **COUNTEROFFER Option:** If I make a counteroffer, player 2 will either accept, reject and counteroffer, or walk. If I make a counteroffer that is too good for me, I risk not doing better than my outside offer. My goal here is to get as close to my total value (321) while making a reasonable offer to Player 2. I should start by proposing an offer that gives Player 2 the smallest amount I can get away with. Let us consider offering them just 1 unit of each item. This yields player 2 total value of at most 101*7=707. Since their outside offer is at most 707, they will be willing to take any deal with total value > 0. If I keep the rest of the items I obtain value (3 * 49 + 15 *0 + 13*0 + 30*1 + 43*1= 147 + 0 + 0 + 30+ 43 = 220). The value of 220 is less than my outside option, and would mean I am getting a worse deal.\n\nIf I offer player 2 nothing and keep all items myself, my total value is 321. Let's see if there's a reasonable first offer. I know that for player 2, their value is between 1 and 101 per item. A first offer of 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, etc. might be enough, as this is 7 units worth at least 7 to player 2, and since I offer this at the beginning, they'll be willing to accept it, and that may be enough to get them to play. Let's see what it gives me.\n\nIf I offer 1 unit of each item, player 2 will have at most 101 * 5 + 101 * 1 + 101 *1 + 101 * 2 + 101 * 2 = 101 * 7 = 707 if they got all the units. I keep 2 units of item 1, and no units of the other items, which is a value of 2 * 49 = 98. This is not good enough.\n\nLet me think instead about a more fair offer, which would mean that the overall split for me and player 2 is something close to 50/50, and at least higher than my outside option. This would also make player 2 more inclined to accept at round 1.\nIf we look at the total units, there are 9 items to split, which will be very difficult to get to 50% each, since my valuations are different. Let's try to give away 1 unit of item 1, which is relatively high for me (49) and low for player 2 (avg 50). I will give 0 of item 2 (since it's low for me 15), 0 of item 3 (13 for me), 1 of item 4 (30 for me) and 1 of item 5 (43 for me) This would mean that I keep 2 units of item 1 (2 * 49= 98), 1 unit of item 2 (15), 1 unit of item 3 (13), 1 unit of item 4 (30), 1 unit of item 5 (43). Total value 98+15+13+30+43 = 199.\nI offer 1 unit of item 1 to player 2, 1 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\nTotal value for me is 199, which is less than my outside offer (230). This is not good, I will do a different approach.\n\nLet's offer Player 2 as little value as possible, while still making a valid offer. Since the smallest amount of each item is 0. Let's try to only give Player 2 1 unit of item 1.\nIf I offer Player 2 1 unit of item 1, my value is 2 * 49 + 15 + 13 + 2 * 30 + 2 * 43 = 98+15+13+60+86 = 272. This is bigger than 230, so this offer makes sense.\n\n**Decision**\n\nI will offer 1 unit of item 1 to player 2 and keep the rest.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This applies to future rounds.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nSince it is round 1, and I have to either WALK, or make a counteroffer, I will choose to make a counteroffer. I need to decide how to divide the items.  My primary goal is to exceed my outside offer value of 469. \n\nA reasonable initial offer would be to give the other player roughly half the value.  However, because my value per item varies, offering half the items may not be ideal, given the other player likely has a different value per item. I will start by offering a simple division of half the items for all items except item 5 where they only receive 1 item. Here is what that offer looks like:\n    Player 2 receives:\n    2 units of item 1\n    3 units of item 2\n    2 units of item 3\n    2 units of item 4\n    1 units of item 5\n    \n    My total value from this outcome:\n    2 units of item 1 = 2 * 79 = 158\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 * 43 = 129\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 * 51 = 153\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 * 57 = 171\n    2 units of item 5 = 2 * 91 = 182\n    Total value to me: 793\n\nSince the total value of this outcome to me (793) is greater than my outside offer (469), this seems like a decent starting offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 2, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 346. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 759 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the optimal action for Player 1 in the first round.\n\n**Understanding the Game:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Maximize my discounted value from the negotiation, compared to my outside offer (346).\n*   **Items:** 5 types of items, with quantities 5, 2, 1, 7, 2 respectively.\n*   **My Values:** 21, 61, 69, 42, 60 for item types 1-5.\n*   **Discount:** gamma = 0.9\n*   **Rounds:** 3 rounds of negotiation.\n*   **Actions:** ACCEPT, COUNTEROFFER, WALK.\n\n**Round 1 Analysis:**\n\n*   **No current offer:** Player 2 hasn't made an offer yet, so I cannot accept anything yet.\n*   **My Options:** I can either walk away or make a counteroffer.\n\n**Calculating the Value of Keeping Everything:**\nFirst, let's compute the maximum value I could get if I keep all the items for myself:\n\n* Item 1: 5 * 21 = 105\n* Item 2: 2 * 61 = 122\n* Item 3: 1 * 69 = 69\n* Item 4: 7 * 42 = 294\n* Item 5: 2 * 60 = 120\n* Total Value = 105 + 122 + 69 + 294 + 120 = 710\n\n**Considering a Counteroffer:**\nSince I have a guaranteed value of 346, I need to make an offer that I am willing to accept. Because this is the first round, I am not at risk of any loss by trying to come to an agreement, and as I will go last in the third round, if we reach it, I can effectively ensure I get at least the equivalent of my outside offer. I will try a generous offer to my opponent which is 3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 1 of item 5. Let's calculate my value if I give this to my opponent:\n\n* Item 1: (5 - 3) * 21 = 42\n* Item 2: (2 - 1) * 61 = 61\n* Item 3: (1 - 1) * 69 = 0\n* Item 4: (7 - 3) * 42 = 168\n* Item 5: (2 - 1) * 60 = 60\n* Total Value = 42 + 61 + 0 + 168 + 60 = 331\n\nGiven that this is below my outside offer of 346, I can't propose it.\n\nLet me try a much more conservative offer: 1 unit of each item:\n\n* Item 1: (5 - 1) * 21 = 84\n* Item 2: (2 - 1) * 61 = 61\n* Item 3: (1 - 1) * 69 = 0\n* Item 4: (7 - 1) * 42 = 252\n* Item 5: (2 - 1) * 60 = 60\n* Total Value = 84 + 61 + 0 + 252 + 60 = 457\n\nThis would give my opponent:\n* Item 1: 1 * value_2 (unknown)\n* Item 2: 1 * value_2 (unknown)\n* Item 3: 1 * value_2 (unknown)\n* Item 4: 1 * value_2 (unknown)\n* Item 5: 1 * value_2 (unknown)\n\nSince this is the first round, I will go ahead with this conservative offer to try and start a negotiation.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Round:** 1\n*   **Player 1's Offer:** [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (meaning Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of each item)\n*   **My Values:** [9, 79, 17, 85, 15] for items 1 through 5 respectively.\n*   **My Outside Offer:** 38\n*   **Discount Factor (gamma):** 0.9\n\n**Calculating the Value of the Current Offer:**\n\nI am being offered 1 unit of each item. My value for this offer is:\n(1 * 9) + (1 * 79) + (1 * 17) + (1 * 85) + (1 * 15) = 9 + 79 + 17 + 85 + 15 = 205\n\n**Comparing to Outside Offer:**\n\nThe value of the current offer (205) is much higher than my outside offer (38). Therefore, it is in my best interest to consider accepting the current offer, as long as that still leaves me with most of the value. However, there are two remaining rounds, so there is an opportunity to obtain an even better deal by making a counteroffer.\n\n**Considering a Counteroffer:**\n\nTo determine if it's advantageous to counteroffer, I will analyze what I would want to keep and how valuable that is compared to the current offer. I have 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 7 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. Let's calculate the total value of all items to me:\n(5 * 9) + (2 * 79) + (1 * 17) + (7 * 85) + (2 * 15) = 45 + 158 + 17 + 595 + 30 = 845\nIf I made a counteroffer, my value would have to be greater than 205 * 0.9 to be worth it. The reason for this is that acceptance gives me a payoff of 205 in this round, whereas waiting until round 2 is worth 205 * gamma or 205 * 0.9 = 184.5. If I were to make an offer that was worth 184.5, then it would have to be greater than 205 * 0.9 = 184.5. However, if I were to accept an offer in round 1, I would be guaranteed 205 immediately. If I were to make a counteroffer now, then the negotiation would carry on into round 2, and I would receive a deal (assuming it is accepted). As such, a deal in round 2 would be worth 0.9 * value, so I need to ensure the value from a counteroffer is large enough such that even with the discount factor applied to it, it still would yield a higher value than the current acceptance value of 205.\n\nTo try to increase the amount of value I receive, I could offer Player 1 what they offered me and keep all the remaining items myself. This would leave me with the following items:\nItem 1: 4 units\nItem 2: 1 units\nItem 3: 0 units\nItem 4: 6 units\nItem 5: 1 units\n\nThis results in a total value of:\n(4 * 9) + (1 * 79) + (0 * 17) + (6 * 85) + (1 * 15) = 36 + 79 + 0 + 510 + 15 = 640\nThis would have a discounted value of 640 * 0.9 = 576 in round 2. Since this is greater than 205 * 0.9 = 184.5, it makes sense to make this counteroffer. If Player 1 accepts, then I would gain 576. If Player 1 makes a counteroffer, then I can analyze that counteroffer and act accordingly.\n\nTherefore, a counteroffer is better than an acceptance, given the values in this game. Let's make this counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Compare the discounted value of the current offer to my outside offer:**\n\n* My outside offer: 38\n* Discounted value of current offer: 322.2\n\nSince the discounted value of the current offer (322.2) is much greater than my outside offer (38), I should not walk away.\n\n**4. Consider a counteroffer**\n\nI have 5 of Item 1, 2 of Item 2, 1 of Item 3, 7 of Item 4 and 2 of Item 5.\nThe current offer gives me 2 of item 1, 4 of item 4. \n\nMy value for those items are: 2*9 + 4*85 = 18 + 340 = 358.\nMy total value for all the items is: 5 * 9 + 2 * 79 + 1 * 17 + 7 * 85 + 2 * 15 = 45 + 158 + 17 + 595 + 30 = 845.\nI am being given 358, this gives the other player 845 - 358 = 487, which makes me think I can do a bit better than the current offer.\n\nSince this is round 2, if I give a counter offer, I'm not sure if player 1 will accept, but if they don't, the last round I will be forced to walk away. \nI have the benefit that I know that 322.2 is a good deal for me. I could offer the other player a counter offer that still gives me more than 38 in expectation.\n\nIf I take the current offer, my discounted value is 322.2\nIf I walk away I get 38.\nI will try to improve the offer by making a counteroffer. Let's aim for a slightly more advantageous position, say by offering [1,0,0,3,0].\nThis means I would receive 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 4 of item 4 and 2 of item 5.\nMy value for this is: 4*9 + 2*79 + 1*17 + 4*85 + 2*15 = 36 + 158 + 17 + 340 + 30 = 581\nDiscounted value: 581 * 0.9 = 522.9\n\nThis would be very good for me but it is unlikely Player 1 would accept such an offer. I could go for a slightly more fair counter offer of [1,0,0,2,0], giving me [4,2,1,5,2].\nMy value would be: 4*9 + 2*79 + 1*17 + 5*85 + 2*15 = 36 + 158 + 17 + 425 + 30 = 666\nDiscounted value: 666 * 0.9 = 599.4. \nThis is still quite good. I will go for this, but in the interest of getting a deal done in this round, I will accept the current offer.\n\n**Action:**\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's break down the situation and determine my best action as Player 1 in round 1.\n\n**Understanding My Situation**\n\n*   **My Values:** I value item 1 at 69, item 2 at 42, item 3 at 61, item 4 at 79, and item 5 at 77 per unit.\n*   **My Outside Offer:** My outside offer is worth 254. This is my guaranteed minimum value if negotiations fail, and hence my 'reservation value'.\n*   **Available Items:** There are 2 units of item 1, 3 of item 2, 8 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 5 of item 5.\n*   **Goal:** Maximize my total value, considering the discount factor (0.9) and my outside offer.\n*   **First Move:** I am the first player in this round, so I need to make an offer.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nI should start with a counteroffer that is beneficial for me if accepted in this first round, taking into account that the other player has their own private values and outside option. I do not yet know what is acceptable to them, so a moderate offer that leaves some space for negotiation seems like a good starting point.\n\nA simple approach is to offer half of the items to Player 2 and keep half for myself. Since I have an outside offer, there is a minimum value I need to reach. Let's calculate that first:\n\n**Calculating value of half the items**\n*   Item 1: 2/2 = 1 unit to player 2, keep 1.\n*   Item 2: 3/2 = 1.5 units. Since you must offer integer units of items, we need to decide how to divide this: let us keep 2 and give 1 to Player 2\n*   Item 3: 8/2 = 4 units to player 2, keep 4.\n*   Item 4: 3/2 = 1.5 units. We keep 2 and give 1 to Player 2.\n*   Item 5: 5/2 = 2.5 units. We keep 3 and give 2 to Player 2.\n\nThis gives me 1 unit of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\n\nMy value if this is accepted in round 1 is:\n(1 * 69) + (2 * 42) + (4 * 61) + (2 * 79) + (3 * 77) = 69 + 84 + 244 + 158 + 231 = 786\n\nThis is more than my outside offer of 254, but I don't know how it compares to the other players value, and we need to take into account that they could offer a counter offer that has a higher value.\n\nSince we need to be sure to offer integer numbers of items we could also go the other way and calculate a round down offer: \nKeep 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\nThis would leave us offering the other player: 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\nMy value would then be: (1 * 69) + (1 * 42) + (4 * 61) + (1 * 79) + (2 * 77) = 69 + 42 + 244 + 79 + 154 = 588.\n\n**Counteroffer**\n\nI will use the first option, and offer 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 to player 2.\n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 4, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

Compare the current offer to my outside offer, and account for discount**\nMy current outside offer value is 1011.\nMy outside offer would be worth 1011.\nIf I accept the current offer I get a value of 739 with no discount.\nIf I reject it and counteroffer, and reach a deal in the last round it will be discounted by gamma to the power of (2-1) or 0.9 to the power of 1 = 0.9. \nIf I reject it and walk it will be 1011 discounted by 0.9 to the power of 0, or 1011.\n\n**3. Determine my best action**\nThe current offer is worth 739, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 1011. Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\nI will make a counteroffer, giving player 1 the minimum number of items possible while still trying to maximize my payoff. Since it's round one, I'll aim high and if it's not accepted I'll be in a position to walk away in later rounds.\n\nI will propose the following allocation to player 1: \n* Item 1: 0\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 0\n\nThis leaves me with all the items, for a total value of (3 * 7) + (8 * 11) + (9 * 73) + (2 * 51) + (9 * 53) = 21 + 88 + 657 + 102 + 477 = 1345\n\n**Final Action**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Let's calculate the value of this offer to Player 1:\n    *   Item 1: (3 - 1) * 100 = 200\n    *   Item 2: (8 - 4) * 37 = 148\n    *   Item 3: (9 - 4) * 28 = 140\n    *   Item 4: (2 - 1) * 86 = 86\n    *   Item 5: (9 - 4) * 63 = 315\n    *   Total Value from round 1 offer: 200 + 148 + 140 + 86 + 315 = 889\n    \n    The value of the counter offer in Round 1 was therefore 889.\n\n4. **Discounted Value Comparison:** The game is currently in round 2. If I accept in this round, my value would be discounted by gamma^1 = 0.9. If there's a round 3, any value would be discounted by gamma^2 = 0.81.\n\n5. **Optimal Strategy:** Because I am currently offered nothing, the current offer of 0 value is lower than my outside offer of 703. Additionally, the other player offered me 0 in round 1 and appears unwilling to negotiate. At this point, I should make a counter offer that provides me with at least my outside value of 703 in the next round.  I should offer them the minimum necessary so that my remaining items sum to over 703 if accepted.\n\n    **Calculating a Good Counteroffer**\n    If I keep all items for myself, my total value is:\n    * Item 1: 3 * 100 = 300\n    * Item 2: 8 * 37 = 296\n    * Item 3: 9 * 28 = 252\n    * Item 4: 2 * 86 = 172\n    * Item 5: 9 * 63 = 567\n    * Total: 1587\n\n    The round 1 counter offer, which I offered, had value 889. If I increase this value in round 2, the next best offer I should try giving the other player should reduce the overall value for me to 703, so I should calculate this.\n     * My total value is 1587, and my outside offer is 703. \n    I should try offering the other player a deal so that I end up with approximately 703 value in items if they accept.\n    * If I give away no items of type 1, 2, or 4 and all items of type 3 and 5:\n    * Value to me: 3*100 + 8*37 + 2*86 = 300 + 296 + 172 = 768\n    * If I give away 1 of type 1 and all of type 3 and 5:\n    * Value to me: 2*100 + 8*37 + 2*86 = 200 + 296 + 172 = 668\n    * This is not enough.\n    * Let me try keeping only type 1 and 4. To get slightly over the outside offer:\n    * Value to me: 3*100 + 2*86 = 300 + 172 = 472\n    * If I keep 1 of type 2\n    * Value to me: 3*100 + 1*37 + 2*86 = 300 + 37 + 172 = 509\n    * If I keep 2 of type 2\n    * Value to me: 3*100 + 2*37 + 2*86 = 300 + 74 + 172 = 546\n    * I should keep the original round 1 offer.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is 0 and unacceptable, and since I think the original round 1 offer was the best starting point for negotiation, I will stick with it. I will make a counteroffer reflecting what I would want to give away to the other player.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 4, 1, 4]}\n```\n",

I will offer player 1 the quantities that would give me my maximum value (if they accept).

This is far lower than my outside offer value of 81. Therefore, I should not accept this offer. I should definitely make a counteroffer, as it is round 1 and I will discount any potential deal next round.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer that would give me at least as much as my outside offer. A simple way to do this is to calculate my optimal outcome if I receive all the items and offer to give half to player 1.\n\nHere's the calculation for the value of each item at full quantities, based on my private values:\n* Item 1: 3 * 4 = 12\n* Item 2: 4 * 69 = 276\n* Item 3: 6 * 31 = 186\n* Item 4: 5 * 91 = 455\n* Item 5: 2 * 70 = 140\n\nNow, let's determine a counteroffer that seems reasonable for me to achieve at least as much as my outside offer, while also giving a share to Player 1.\n\nI will calculate the value of all items and try to offer the other player half of each item rounded down, if possible. \n*   Item 1: 3 // 2 = 1\n*   Item 2: 4 // 2 = 2\n*   Item 3: 6 // 2 = 3\n*   Item 4: 5 // 2 = 2\n*   Item 5: 2 // 2 = 1\n\nThe value of my remaining items is :\n*   Item 1: 2 * 4 = 8\n*   Item 2: 2 * 69 = 138\n*   Item 3: 3 * 31 = 93\n*   Item 4: 3 * 91 = 273\n*   Item 5: 1 * 70 = 70\nMy total value in this scenario would be: 8 + 138 + 93 + 273 + 70 = 582\nThis is more than my outside offer.\n\nI will offer the other player the division as calculated above.\n**Counteroffer:** [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

Understand the Game Dynamics:**\n\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means that deals made in later rounds are worth less (to each player) than deals made in earlier rounds.\n*   **Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 1249. This is the guaranteed value if negotiations fail.\n*   **Round 1 Strategy:** Since this is round 1, I need to propose an initial offer to Player 2. I need to make a proposal that gives Player 2 enough value to encourage them to accept, but I also want to maximize my share.\n*   **Risk of a Walk:** If Player 2 walks, I receive my outside offer of 1249. So, I need to make an offer that gives me more than that.\n\n**3. Analyze Possible Offers**\n   \n    Since I am going first, I will want to offer the other player a deal they are most likely to accept. I will do this by offering them a deal slightly better than a 50/50 split, keeping a greater portion of the most valuable items to myself. \n\n    Lets start by giving the other player half of each item (rounding up for items with odd numbers):\n        Item 1: 4 units * 75 value/unit = 300\n        Item 2: 2 units * 88 value/unit = 176\n        Item 3: 3 units * 4 value/unit = 12\n        Item 4: 3 units * 75 value/unit = 225\n        Item 5: 2 units * 79 value/unit = 158\n    Total Value = 300 + 176 + 12 + 225 + 158 = 871. This leaves me with a value of 1509-871=638. This is less than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try a different approach. I will offer the other player:\n        Item 1: 2 units * 75 value/unit = 150\n        Item 2: 1 units * 88 value/unit = 88\n        Item 3: 2 units * 4 value/unit = 8\n        Item 4: 2 units * 75 value/unit = 150\n        Item 5: 1 units * 79 value/unit = 79\n     Total value = 150 + 88 + 8 + 150 + 79 = 475\n     This leaves me with 1509-475 = 1034. This is still much less than my outside option, so I need to try a different approach.\n   \n   Let's try offering Player 2 a deal with items they are likely to want. Let's try offering 2 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n      Item 1: 2 units * 75 value/unit = 150\n        Item 2: 2 units * 88 value/unit = 176\n        Item 3: 2 units * 4 value/unit = 8\n        Item 4: 2 units * 75 value/unit = 150\n        Item 5: 1 units * 79 value/unit = 79\n        Total Value = 150 + 176 + 8 + 150 + 79= 563\n\n        This leaves me with 1509-563=946. This is still below my walk away value.\n\n    Let's offer the other player items that are less valuable to me.\n    Let's offer 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 1 of item 5:\n         Item 1: 0 units * 75 value/unit = 0\n        Item 2: 0 units * 88 value/unit = 0\n        Item 3: 3 units * 4 value/unit = 12\n        Item 4: 2 units * 75 value/unit = 150\n        Item 5: 1 units * 79 value/unit = 79\n        Total Value = 0 + 0 + 12 + 150 + 79 = 241\n\n        This leaves me with 1509-241=1268. This is above my walk away, so I will make this offer.\n\n**4. Determine My Action**\n\nBased on the analysis above, I will make an initial counteroffer to Player 2 offering them 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

Calculate the value of the current offer to Player 2:**\n\n*   Item 1: 0 units * 17 = 0\n*   Item 2: 0 units * 63 = 0\n*   Item 3: 3 units * 36 = 108\n*   Item 4: 2 units * 99 = 198\n*   Item 5: 1 unit * 45 = 45\n*   **Total Value of Offer:** 0 + 0 + 108 + 198 + 45 = 351\n\n**2. Compare the offer value to the outside offer:**\n\n*   Current Offer Value: 351\n*   Outside Offer Value: 676\n\nSince the current offer value (351) is significantly less than the outside offer (676), it's not beneficial for Player 2 to accept it.\n\n**3. Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nIn round 1, we have some flexibility. We want to maximize our value, and we know we can guarantee at least 676 if negotiations fail. It is possible player 1 made an offer where they gave us their lowest value items, and kept items that they value much more. In this case, we might consider an offer that gives us more units of what we value, and giving away what we value less. \nLet's calculate what we would have if we kept all the items and see how this compares to our outside offer.\n*   Item 1: 7 units * 17 = 119\n*   Item 2: 4 units * 63 = 252\n*   Item 3: 5 units * 36 = 180\n*   Item 4: 5 units * 99 = 495\n*   Item 5: 3 units * 45 = 135\n*   **Total Value if we kept everything** 1181\nWe see that we value everything at 1181, so the offer is clearly worse for us.\n\nIf we try to equalize the items so we are both getting equal value, we should offer around half the total items to player 1.\n*   Item 1: 3 units\n*   Item 2: 2 units\n*   Item 3: 2 units\n*   Item 4: 2 units\n*   Item 5: 1 unit\nThis would mean player 2 gets 4, 2, 3, 3, 2\nValue of our offer to player 1:\n*   Item 1: 3 * 17 = 51\n*   Item 2: 2 * 63 = 126\n*   Item 3: 2 * 36 = 72\n*   Item 4: 2 * 99 = 198\n*   Item 5: 1 * 45 = 45\nTotal 492\n\nValue we keep:\n*   Item 1: 4 * 17 = 68\n*   Item 2: 2 * 63 = 126\n*   Item 3: 3 * 36 = 108\n*   Item 4: 3 * 99 = 297\n*   Item 5: 2 * 45 = 90\nTotal 689\n\nThis is slightly better than the outside option, and we get to keep more items. It might be acceptable to just walk now, but we are still early on, so a counteroffer seems better.\n\n**4. Action:**\n\nSince the current offer is unacceptable, and there's a chance to improve the outcome, Player 2 should make a counteroffer. The suggested counteroffer of [3, 2, 2, 2, 1] seems like it could be a good starting point.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 2, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

I would not want to give too much away in the first round. I will divide the total number of units of each item type by two and give player 2 that value, rounding down, then I keep the remaining units. If the total number of a given item type is odd, I give player 2 the smaller value and keep one more unit for myself.\n\nHere's the proposed offer to Player 2:\n*   Item 1: 6 // 2 = 3 (give 3 to player 2, keep 3)\n*   Item 2: 3 // 2 = 1 (give 1 to player 2, keep 2)\n*   Item 3: 4 // 2 = 2 (give 2 to player 2, keep 2)\n*   Item 4: 2 // 2 = 1 (give 1 to player 2, keep 1)\n*   Item 5: 6 // 2 = 3 (give 3 to player 2, keep 3)\n\nThis offer means I keep:\n*   Item 1: 3\n*   Item 2: 2\n*   Item 3: 2\n*   Item 4: 1\n*   Item 5: 3\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n(3 * 96) + (2 * 89) + (2 * 35) + (1 * 85) + (3 * 42) = 288 + 178 + 70 + 85 + 126 = 747\n\nSince my outside offer is 30 and this total is 747, I would like to make this offer.\n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 1, 3]}\n```\n",

Since it's round 1, I will try to get as much as possible\n\nSince the total amounts of each item are: \n* 4 units of item 1\n* 3 units of item 2\n* 1 unit of item 3\n* 2 units of item 4\n* 7 units of item 5\n\nI will counteroffer with giving away a small portion of the items.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I give away the following to Player 1:\n* 0 units of item 1\n* 0 unit of item 2\n* 0 unit of item 3\n* 0 units of item 4\n* 0 unit of item 5\nThat means, I'll keep:\n* 4 units of item 1 = 4 * 56 = 224\n* 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 63 = 189\n* 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 29 = 29\n* 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 21 = 42\n* 7 units of item 5 = 7 * 5 = 35\nThe total value for me will be 224 + 189 + 29 + 42 + 35 = 519, which is greater than my outside offer of 419.\nThus I will offer zero of every item.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Since I have all of the bargaining power right now, I should make a counteroffer that I value at more than 375.\nI want to maximize my value, so I should offer the minimum number of items to Player 2, while still ensuring I get more than 375. It is also worth noting that my outside offer is pretty low when compared to my total value, so the negotiation process is quite beneficial for me in this particular instance.\n\nLet's analyze an offer where I keep most items. I'll give Player 2 the minimum of one of each type. If I offer player 2 1 unit of each item, here is what I keep:\nItem 1: 3 units at 99 each = 297\nItem 2: 6 units at 25 each = 150\nItem 3: 5 units at 40 each = 200\nItem 4: 2 units at 94 each = 188\nItem 5: 4 units at 74 each = 296\nTotal value = 1131. This is clearly higher than my outside offer, so this is a good option.\n\n**Decision**\n\nI will make a counteroffer giving Player 2 1 of each item type.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

I cannot accept an offer as there is none. I also cannot walk away yet as there might be a better deal. Thus, I must make a counteroffer, and I want it to be one that is likely to be accepted by Player 2. I also need to factor in the discount factor later, so the sooner I agree, the better.\n\n7. **Reasoning:** I will start by considering an equal split of items and then adjust if I think that will not be accepted. Given that my total valuation is 762, If we split the items approximately equally, I would expect the value of my total items to be around 762 / 2 = 381. Since this is less than my outside offer of 599, I will need to keep some more of the value and offer player 2 less to make a deal more beneficial to me.\nThe total available items are 8 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 5 units of item 4 and 4 units of item 5.\n\n8. **Making a counteroffer:**\nSince I have an outside offer of 599, I will make a counteroffer that is beneficial to me and I think has a chance of being accepted by player 2 in round 2. I will offer Player 2 a bit less than half the total value (which is 762/2 = 381), which would mean I am keeping a little more than half. I will not offer half of every item to player 2 because that is not necessarily the best strategy due to different per-unit values. I will aim to offer Player 2 a little less of the high-value items for me, and a bit more of the low value items.\nLet's try offering Player 2:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 29 = 87 (remaining value for me is 5 * 29 = 145)\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 46 = 46 (remaining value for me is 2 * 46 = 92)\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 60 = 0 (remaining value for me is 1 * 60 = 60)\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 56 = 112 (remaining value for me is 3 * 56 = 168)\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 13 = 26 (remaining value for me is 2 * 13 = 26)\nTotal offer value to Player 2 = 87 + 46 + 0 + 112 + 26 = 271\nTotal value kept for me = 145 + 92 + 60 + 168 + 26 = 491. Note 491 + 271 = 762 (total value)\nSince my outside offer is 599, this is not a very good offer for me, and I need to keep more items.\n\nLet me try this strategy instead, offering player 2 less:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 29 = 58\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 46 = 46\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 60 = 0\n    *   1 units of item 4: 1 * 56 = 56\n    *   1 units of item 5: 1 * 13 = 13\nTotal offer to player 2 = 58 + 46 + 0 + 56 + 13 = 173\nTotal value kept for me = (6 * 29) + (2 * 46) + (1 * 60) + (4 * 56) + (3 * 13) = 174 + 92 + 60 + 224 + 39 = 589. Note 589 + 173 = 762.\nThis is still less than my outside offer and I am still being generous.\n\nLet's try the following offer, and aim to keep slightly more for myself:\n* 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 29 = 29\n* 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 46 = 46\n* 0 units of item 3: 0 * 60 = 0\n* 0 unit of item 4: 0 * 56 = 0\n* 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 13 = 13\nTotal offer value to Player 2 = 29 + 46 + 0 + 0 + 13 = 88\nTotal value kept for me = 7 * 29 + 2 * 46 + 1 * 60 + 5 * 56 + 3 * 13 = 203 + 92 + 60 + 280 + 39 = 674. This is a value greater than my outside offer of 599.\n\nOkay, I will offer Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 1 of item 5. This will give me a value of 674.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1. So current offer remains at 116.\n\n5. **Comparison:** The value of the current offer (116) is much less than my outside offer (525). Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a poor decision.\n\n6. **Counteroffer strategy:**  I want to try to get a better deal without walking away right now. My goal is to get the most value. I will attempt a counteroffer. My strategy is to offer a deal where I get to keep more of my high value items (3 and 5) and less of my low value items (1, 2, and 4). Since Player 1 seems to like item 1 and 2, I will give them some of that. I should also avoid taking too little of the remaining items and give player 1 more of the items that I don't value much.\n\n7. **Proposed Counteroffer:**\n    - Offer Player 1: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\n    - This leaves me: 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 unit of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n    - Value to me: (4 * 29) + (1 * 31) + (1 * 90) + (2 * 37) + (4 * 56) = 116 + 31 + 90 + 74 + 224 = 535\n\n8. **Counteroffer vs Outside offer:** My calculated value of 535 is greater than my outside offer of 525, so this counteroffer is better than walking away.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 0, 3, 0]}\n```\n",

An equitable split that offers some value for player 2 could be giving half of the total number of units to player 2 for the items that have units (we cannot give any units of item 1).

I have no current offer to accept. I must either make a counteroffer or walk. I need to make an initial offer to Player 2, keeping in mind that I want to maximize my expected payoff, taking into account the discount factor in later rounds.\n\n6.  **Optimal Strategy:** In the first round, I need to be strategic, thinking what is my best offer to achieve a good outcome. The optimal initial offer can be determined by iterative backward reasoning, and can be tricky to calculate. However, because I have the outside option of 567, and with a total value of all items of 616, It's risky to make an opening offer that leaves me with a value below 567. Let's start with an equal split and see how that fares for me.\n\n**Evaluating an Equal Split Offer**\n\nIf I give half of each item (or close to half in case of odd number) to Player 2.\nI'd keep:\n* Item 1: 2 units (2*8=16)\n* Item 2: 1 unit (1*61=61)\n* Item 3: 3 units (3*41=123)\n* Item 4: 1 unit (1*34=34)\n* Item 5: 1 unit (1*29=29)\n\nMy value would then be 16+61+123+34+29=263\n\nLet's try to make an offer that is more than the half split, but still reasonable. I will attempt to keep all the items for myself, except 1 unit of item 3, which I will offer to Player 2.\n\n**Evaluating my Counteroffer:**\nMy offer to Player 2 would be [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nIf Player 2 accepts it, my retained value will be:\n* Item 1: 4 units (4*8=32)\n* Item 2: 3 units (3*61=183)\n* Item 3: 5 units (5*41=205)\n* Item 4: 2 unit (2*34=68)\n* Item 5: 3 unit (3*29=87)\n\nMy total value is 32+183+205+68+87=575. This is more than my outside offer of 567.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince I have no current offer, I need to make an initial counteroffer to player 2.\nBased on the analysis I am going to offer 1 unit of item 3 to player 2 and retain the rest for myself.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

I will now consider what might be a better offer for me.  It is round 2, so there is only one round remaining, and I need to decide whether to offer something better than the current offer in an attempt to secure a better deal.\n\nI am going to make a counteroffer that will get me a very high value which would probably be accepted by Player 2. To do this, I will offer only one unit each of item 1, 3, and 5 to player 2, and give them zero of item 2 and 4. I will take the rest.\n\n**Counteroffer Calculation:**\n* **Player 2's Offer:** Item 1: 1, Item 2: 0, Item 3: 1, Item 4: 0, Item 5: 1\n* **My Remaining items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 2\n*   **Value of My Remaining Items:**\n   *  3 units of item 1: 3 * 8 = 24\n   * 3 units of item 2: 3 * 61 = 183\n   * 5 units of item 3: 5 * 41 = 205\n   * 2 units of item 4: 2 * 34 = 68\n   * 2 units of item 5: 2 * 29 = 58\n    *  Total value of my counteroffer: 24 + 183 + 205 + 68 + 58 = 538\n*   **Discounted value of my counter offer:** 538 * 0.9 = 484.2\n * Since this discounted value is less than my outside offer I cannot accept it. I will offer player 2 the minimum to guarantee I am not worse off than my outside offer. I want Player 2 to have 0 of items 2 and 4. Lets work this out.\n\n* Items 2 and 4 I do not want them to have any.\n* Item 1 I will give them 0, which will leave me with 4 * 8 = 32\n* Item 3 I will give them 1, which leaves me with 5 * 41 = 205\n* Item 5 I will give them 0, which leaves me with 3 * 29 = 87\n * Total before discounting 32 + 205 + 87 = 324\n\nI need a counteroffer such that when multiplied by 0.9 it is greater than my outside offer. 567/0.9 = 630. So, let's calculate what I need to offer to player 2 so my value will be greater than 630.\n\n* Offer player 2 0 of items 2 and 4\n* Offer them 1 of item 1 = 8. My value is now 32\n* Offer them 1 of item 3 = 41. My value is now 32 + 205 = 237.\n* Offer them 1 of item 5 = 29. My value is now 237 + 58 = 295\n\nI am very far off 630, so I need to keep calculating to find an offer that works:\n\nI will offer Player 2: 0 item 2, 0 item 4, 1 item 1, 1 item 3, 1 item 5. This leaves me with the following:\n* 3 of item 1 = 24\n* 3 of item 2 = 183\n* 5 of item 3 = 205\n* 2 of item 4 = 68\n* 2 of item 5 = 58\n* Total = 538. discounted = 484.2\n\nI need my discounted value to be 567 or higher to be better than my outside offer. Therefore my undicounted value must be 630.\n\nLet's try an offer of 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 for P2. \n\n* My remaining value is 4*8 + 3*61+ 6*41+ 2*34 + 3*29 = 616\n* This gives a discounted value of 554.4, which is less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try an offer of 1,0,0,0,0 for P2\n* My remaining value is 3*8 + 3*61+ 6*41+ 2*34 + 3*29 = 608\n* Discounted value is 547.2, still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try an offer of 0, 0, 1, 0, 0\n* My remaining value is 4*8 + 3*61 + 5*41 + 2*34 + 3*29 = 575.\n* Discounted value is 517.5, still less than my outside offer.\n\nIt seems I am not able to improve on my outside offer here.

We should also consider that if we are too aggressive in the first round, Player 2 might walk in future rounds, and we will end up with our outside offer. \n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where we give Player 2 half of each item (rounding down for item 5):\n    *   Item 1: 2 units to Player 2, we keep 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units to Player 2, we keep 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units to Player 2, we keep 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units to Player 2, we keep 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit to Player 2, we keep 2 units\n\n    Calculate the value for us:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 39 = 78\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 12 = 24\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 65 = 195\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 24 = 48\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 62 = 124\n    *   Total value = 78 + 24 + 195 + 48 + 124 = 469\n\n    Since this value (469) is higher than our outside offer value (289), this is a good place to start. We can also afford to offer a little more since this still gives us value well above our outside offer.\n    \n    Let's consider a more balanced counteroffer that favors our high value items:\n    * Item 1: 1 unit to Player 2, we keep 3\n    * Item 2: 1 unit to Player 2, we keep 3\n    * Item 3: 2 unit to Player 2, we keep 4\n    * Item 4: 1 unit to Player 2, we keep 3\n    * Item 5: 1 unit to Player 2, we keep 2\n\n    Calculate value:\n    * 3 units of item 1: 3 * 39 = 117\n    * 3 units of item 2: 3 * 12 = 36\n    * 4 units of item 3: 4 * 65 = 260\n    * 3 units of item 4: 3 * 24 = 72\n    * 2 units of item 5: 2 * 62 = 124\n    * Total value: 117 + 36 + 260 + 72 + 124 = 609\n\n    This is quite good, we will use this offer.\n   \n**Decision:**\n\nWe'll make a counteroffer that gives a small amount of each item to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Since my highest value item is item 4, and I only have 3 units, I should try to keep as many of those as possible. Similarly, my value for item 2 is high and there are 4 units, so I should try and keep most of them.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I will make an offer that allows me to get the most high value items as possible while still getting more than my outside offer.\n\n    I will offer 1 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    * 1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 11 = 11\n    * 0 unit of item 2 = 0 * 100 = 0\n    * 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 72 = 72\n    * 1 units of item 4 = 1 * 11 = 11\n    * 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 12 = 12\n    Total offer value = 11+0+72+11+12=106\n    My value = (2-1)*11 + (3-0)*100 + (5-1)*72 + (4-1)*11 + (2-1)*12 = 11 + 300 + 288 + 33 + 12 = 644.

This is also not above my outside offer.\n\n    I will try giving 0 of 1, 2, 4 and 1 each of 3, 5. My value becomes 666.\n    I will try giving 0 of 1, 2, 4 and 2 of 3, and 1 of 5.\n     * 0 unit of item 1 = 0 * 11 = 0\n    * 0 unit of item 2 = 0 * 100 = 0\n    * 2 unit of item 3 = 2 * 72 = 144\n    * 0 units of item 4 = 0 * 11 = 0\n    * 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 12 = 12\n    Total offer value = 0+0+144+0+12 = 156\n    My value = 22 + 300 + 216 + 44 + 12 = 594. Still less than 679.\n\n    Since my outside offer is so high compared to the value of all my items, I am going to propose a deal where I get almost all the value, only giving the other player 1 of my lowest value items. I will give 1 of item 1 to player 2.\n    * 1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 11 = 11\n    * 0 unit of item 2 = 0 * 100 = 0\n    * 0 unit of item 3 = 0 * 72 = 0\n    * 0 units of item 4 = 0 * 11 = 0\n    * 0 unit of item 5 = 0 * 12 = 0\n     Total offer value = 11\n    My value = 11 + 300 + 360 + 44 + 24 = 739\n\n    This is still below the outside offer.

This could be reasonable later rounds if offers aren't good, but we need to see the other player's potential offer to make a better offer.\n*   **Counteroffer Strategy:** In the first round, we should aim for an offer that leaves us with the most value while also being attractive to player 2 (so they don't just walk away), remembering that we are in the first round and there will be more opportunities to get our desired deal. We should try to offer the other player just under half of the items in each set (in each type) to get the most value but without being too far off from an even split that they would be tempted to walk away.\n\n**Calculating the Value of an Offer**\n\nFirst lets compute how many of each item we have, and what half or slightly less is:\n*   Item 1: 2 units, give 1 to other player.\n*   Item 2: 1 unit, give 0 to other player.\n*   Item 3: 5 units, give 2 to other player.\n*   Item 4: 6 units, give 3 to other player.\n*   Item 5: 2 units, give 1 to other player.\n\nIf we give Player 2 the offer above, we will have:\n*   Item 1: 1 unit, 1 * 89 = 89\n*   Item 2: 1 unit, 1 * 39 = 39\n*   Item 3: 3 units, 3 * 23 = 69\n*   Item 4: 3 units, 3 * 22 = 66\n*   Item 5: 1 unit, 1 * 79 = 79\nThe total value of this offer to us is 89 + 39 + 69 + 66 + 79 = 342.\n\n**Decision**\n\nSince making the above offer is greater than our outside option, it makes sense to make that offer. \n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 3, 1]}\n```\n",

While the current offer exceeds my outside offer, the initial offer is likely not optimal for me.\n\nGiven that the other agent does not know my actual values, I am going to send a counteroffer. I am going to propose that they keep one less of items 3 and 4, and keep more of the rest. This will significantly increase my value.\n\n**My Counteroffer:**\n\nTo calculate my counteroffer, I need to consider what I want to keep for myself. I start with 2, 1, 5, 6, 2.\nI will give the other player 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5, meaning I am proposing they take [1, 1, 1, 2, 1].\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

The current offer to me gives me 246.6, and my previous offer would give me 307.8 if we were to arrive at that conclusion in this round. If we were to give player 2 exactly what they offered (keeping the remaining items for ourselves) the value of the deal to me would be 246.6. This is already much higher than my outside offer so I won't walk. Lets try to counter offer again, making a deal that is better for me, by offering the same thing as the first round.\nTherefore I will counter offer [1, 0, 2, 3, 1] to player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 3, 1]}\n```\n",

Accepting is impossible right now. Walking away would secure us 381, so we need to create a counteroffer that could be better than 381, but we also need to consider that player 2 also has a private outside offer and will also be assessing their outcome.\n\n**Creating a Counteroffer**\nWe want to create an offer that maximizes our value but could also be seen as acceptable by Player 2. In round 1, it is difficult to know what the second player's valuation would be for the items, so a good starting point is to try to get the majority of what is worth more to us and offer the rest. \n\nLet's start by calculating the total value for each item type:\n\n* Item 1: 4 units * 39 = 156\n* Item 2: 4 units * 7 = 28\n* Item 3: 3 units * 89 = 267\n* Item 4: 7 units * 92 = 644\n* Item 5: 3 units * 25 = 75\n* Total value = 1170\n\nWe need to offer a reasonable amount, hoping to maximize our own value but not push player 2 to just walk in round 2. If we offer an even split, we would get roughly half of our total value: 1170 / 2 = 585, which is more than our outside option.\n\nLet's offer Player 2 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5. This leaves for us 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 4 unit of item 4, 2 unit of item 5.\nOur value would be:\n* 2 units of item 1 * 39 = 78\n* 2 units of item 2 * 7 = 14\n* 2 units of item 3 * 89 = 178\n* 4 units of item 4 * 92 = 368\n* 2 units of item 5 * 25 = 50\n* Total: 688\n\nThis is a good deal given that it is far more than our outside offer.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 1, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n**Round 1 Analysis**\n\n*   **Current Offer to Me:** [2, 2, 1, 3, 1] (This is what Player 1 is giving me)\n*   **My Private Values:** Item 1: 84, Item 2: 50, Item 3: 56, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 39\n*   **My Outside Offer:** 753\n*   **Discount Factor (gamma):** 0.9\n\n**Calculate the value of the current offer to me:**\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units * 84 = 168\n*   Item 2: 2 units * 50 = 100\n*   Item 3: 1 unit * 56 = 56\n*   Item 4: 3 units * 4 = 12\n*   Item 5: 1 unit * 39 = 39\n*   **Total Value of Current Offer:** 168 + 100 + 56 + 12 + 39 = 375\n\n**Compare the current offer value to my outside offer value:**\n\n*   My current offer value is 375.\n*   My outside offer is 753.\n\nSince the value of the current offer (375) is less than my outside offer (753), I should not accept it. I need to decide whether to make a counteroffer or walk away.\n\nGiven this is round 1, I can make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal. I want to offer player 1 a deal that is still good for me, but also one that player 1 is likely to accept. It would be beneficial for me to keep more units of the items I value highly (items 1, 2, 3, 5) and give more of item 4 to the other player. Since there are 4 units of item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 7 of item 4, and 3 of item 5, I can give the other player at least 1 of each and also be in a place to possibly have more value.\n\nI will offer the other player 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This offer would give me 3 units of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n\nValue to me:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 * 84 = 252\n*   Item 2: 3 * 50 = 150\n*   Item 3: 2 * 56 = 112\n*   Item 4: 3 * 4 = 12\n*   Item 5: 2 * 39 = 78\n*   Total value of counteroffer to me: 252+150+112+12+78 = 604\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 753, so I will need to calculate the value adjusted by the discount rate. I will consider offering slightly less value to the other player so I get a better return in value to my side of the negotiation. I will also think about the discount rate. If the game makes it to the final round, my value is multiplied by 0.9*0.9 = 0.81. Therefore, I want to make a deal in this round if possible so that I am closer to 100% of value.\n\nLet's try giving Player 1: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This will give me 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\nValue to me:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 * 84 = 252\n*   Item 2: 3 * 50 = 150\n*   Item 3: 2 * 56 = 112\n*   Item 4: 2 * 4 = 8\n*   Item 5: 2 * 39 = 78\n*   Total value of counteroffer to me: 252+150+112+8+78 = 600\n\nThis is still below my outside offer. I will try giving player 1: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\nValue to me:\n*Item 1: 3 * 84 = 252\n*Item 2: 3 * 50 = 150\n*Item 3: 3 * 56 = 168\n*Item 4: 1 * 4 = 4\n*Item 5: 2 * 39 = 78\nTotal Value = 252+150+168+4+78 = 652\nThis is also less than my outside offer, and I also did not give player 1 a unit of each item.\n\nI should try offering 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 5 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\nMy value:\n* Item 1: 3*84=252\n* Item 2: 3*50=150\n* Item 3: 3*56=168\n* Item 4: 2*4=8\n* Item 5: 2*39=78\nTotal: 656\nThis is less than my outside offer, but it's a decent offer.

The discounted value of my outside option in round 2 is 246 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 246 * 0.9 = 221.4\n3.  **Analyze the History:** In round 1, I offered [1, 1, 0, 2, 0] and Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This tells me Player 2 may have low values for the items. I also see that my offer in the first round was not close to being accepted, suggesting that their private outside option is also fairly high (although the fact that they have not walked indicates their outside offer might be lower than the value they would get from even a poor counteroffer).\n\n4.  **Consider a Counteroffer:**  I will make a counteroffer that tries to extract more value while ensuring that it's better than their private outside offer. Let's try giving away small amount of the most valuable items while keeping more of them for myself. I will keep 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. Therefore, I will offer player 2 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5.

The discounted value of the current offer is 137.7, which is less than my outside offer.\n\n**My Strategy**\nI will calculate the value of making a counteroffer that gives Player 1 the minimum they could need while giving me a discounted value greater than my outside option of 234. If I cannot do this, then I will WALK, since this is round 2. Player 1 has consistently offered me 0 of items 3 and 5, suggesting they do not value these items. Let's assume player 1 does not value item 3 at all, and that they do not highly value item 5. This is not likely to be true for item 5 but it seems like the only way I can make progress. I will offer them 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 0 units of item 5. My value in this case will be (3-1) * 90 + (3-1)*47 + (0-0)*1 + (4-1)*16 + (1-0)*58 = 180 + 94 + 0 + 48 + 58 = 380. \nDiscounted this is 380 * 0.9 = 342. This is greater than my outside offer of 234. However, if I give player 1 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 0 of item 5. Then I will have 3 * 90 + 3 * 47 + 0*1 + 4*16 + 1 * 58 = 270 + 141 + 0 + 64 + 58 = 533. Discounted is 533*0.9=479.7, much higher than my outside option. So it is better for me to try for this higher outcome. I will therefore try and maximize my outcome and therefore ask for everything I can in my counter offer, which means offering player 1 nothing.\n\n**Action**\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I want to determine a good counteroffer.  I will calculate the value of keeping each item myself and then think about how to distribute them with Player 2. I will start by offering 0 of all items, then adjust this based on each item. I will then calculate my total value and compare that to my outside offer.\n**Option 1: Offer 0 of each item:**\n\n*   I keep: 5 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 10 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\n*   Value: (5 * 22) + (4 * 2) + (10 * 88) + (3 * 82) + (4 * 81) = 110 + 8 + 880 + 246 + 324 = 1568\n*   This value is more than my outside offer of 724.\n\n**Option 2: Offer something more reasonable**\nI need to think strategically. If I offer too little, player 2 will walk away, and I get my outside offer. My goal is to get more than that. I will consider offering player 2 at least 1 of each item.  This will leave me with\n* I keep: 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 9 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n* My Value: (4*22) + (3*2) + (9*88) + (2*82) + (3*81) = 88 + 6 + 792 + 164 + 243 = 1293. \nThis is better than 724.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 half of all of the items (where possible, rounding down for items that are uneven)\n* Offer Player 2: 2 item 1, 2 item 2, 5 item 3, 1 item 4, 2 item 5\n* I keep: 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 2 of item 5\n* My Value: (3*22) + (2*2) + (5*88) + (2*82) + (2*81) = 66 + 4 + 440 + 164 + 162 = 836.\n\nLet's try offering player 2 slightly less of the high value items (3, 4, and 5) and more of low-value items (1 and 2)\n* Offer Player 2: 3 item 1, 3 item 2, 3 item 3, 1 item 4, 1 item 5\n* I keep: 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 7 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n* My Value: (2*22) + (1*2) + (7*88) + (2*82) + (3*81) = 44 + 2 + 616 + 164 + 243 = 1069\n\nSince my value when offering [3,3,3,1,1] is 1069 and it is still much larger than my outside offer, this seems like a good starting point.

We will use this as a baseline for comparison.\n3.  **Making a Counteroffer:** As this is round 1, we need to make an initial counteroffer. We need to consider what our total value would be if we kept all the items and divide this in a way that would be enticing to player 2. Our total value is (3 * 16) + (4 * 32) + (7 * 43) + (3 * 62) + (7 * 50) = 48 + 128 + 301 + 186 + 350 = 1013.\n\n    If we offered the other player half of the items, they may be enticed to ACCEPT, otherwise, we are more likely to obtain a result that yields a payoff above our outside option over multiple rounds. I will round up to the next whole number if it is not possible to split evenly.\n\n    Let's calculate the amount to offer player 2 for each item:\n    *   Item 1: 3 / 2 = 1.5. Offer 2.\n    *   Item 2: 4 / 2 = 2. Offer 2.\n    *   Item 3: 7 / 2 = 3.5. Offer 4.\n    *   Item 4: 3 / 2 = 1.5. Offer 2.\n    *   Item 5: 7 / 2 = 3.5. Offer 4.\n\n    This gives an offer of [2, 2, 4, 2, 4] to player 2. Let's calculate the value we would retain. \n\n    * Item 1: 3 - 2 = 1. 1 * 16 = 16\n    * Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2. 2 * 32 = 64\n    * Item 3: 7 - 4 = 3. 3 * 43 = 129\n    * Item 4: 3 - 2 = 1. 1 * 62 = 62\n    * Item 5: 7 - 4 = 3. 3 * 50 = 150\n    Total: 16 + 64 + 129 + 62 + 150 = 421\n   \n    This value (421) is significantly higher than the outside offer (191). This gives us a large buffer for the discount factor.\n\n**Decision**\n\nThe best approach is to make a counteroffer that is likely to be accepted by the other player, but also yields us a high payoff above our outside offer.

I should also take into account the discount factor of 0.9, which implies that the player 2 may be more inclined to accept an offer that gives them a better value.\n*   If Player 2 makes a counter offer in the next round, then the values will be reduced by a discount factor of 0.9. This motivates me to make an offer that they will accept now.\n*   Since I don't know the player 2's private values, I don't know how much value they will assign to each item.

My value for item 3 is 82. So the offer is worth:\n1 * 82 = 82\n\n**Compare to my outside offer:**\nThe current offer of 82 is less than my outside offer of 181.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nSince the current offer is lower than my outside offer, I should not accept it. It is the first round, so I will make a counteroffer. A reasonable first round offer is one that is at least acceptable to me given that the discount factor is 0.9. I will make an offer such that my valuation of my portion of the offer is slightly above my outside offer when the discount rate is applied. The discounted value of my outside offer is 181 * 0.9 ^ (1-1) = 181. I will try to make an offer that is at least 1.1 * outside offer if the discount rate were to be applied and I were to receive the offer next round. 181 * 1.1 = 199.1.\n\nI have total value of 721. A fair offer would be to give the other player about half of the items, but i want more, so I will give the minimum needed to get me to 1.1*181 which is 199.1. \nLets try to calculate the maximum value i can get by offering the other player 0 units of every item. My value will be 1 * 4 + 3 * 87 + 4 * 82 + 5 * 25 + 3 * 1 = 721.\nI want to reach value of 199.1 at least. 199.1/ 0.9 = 221.22. I need to get a value of 221.22 in the next round. This means my value must be at least 221.22 now. Since I want to keep as much as I can, I will offer the smallest value combination possible to the other player. Since the other player offered me 1 unit of item 3, I will offer them that back. Lets see what the result is if I offer player 1 1 unit of item 3, leaving me with:\nItem 1: 1*4 = 4\nItem 2: 3 * 87 = 261\nItem 3: 3 * 82 = 246\nItem 4: 5 * 25 = 125\nItem 5: 3 * 1 = 3\nTotal: 639.

The current offer's discounted value of 88.2 is much less than my outside offer of 558. So I should not accept this offer.\n\nSince I do not want to accept, I can either walk or make a counteroffer. I will try to make a counteroffer.\n\nSince my most valuable item is item 3 (value 98) and the opponent offered me 1 unit, I should make sure to obtain more of that item in the negotiation.

I will propose to take all of item 3 and all of item 2. So I will offer [0,0,0,0,0]. However, I will not offer everything to the other player. I will offer them the remaining of items 1, 4, and 5. This yields the following.\nMy proposed offer to Player 2 will be [1, 3, 0, 5, 3]. This means that I get to keep item 2 and item 3. Let's calculate my value:\n* Items I keep :\n    * 3 units of item 2: 3 * 65 = 195\n    * 4 units of item 3: 4 * 98 = 392\nTotal value of this offer to me: 195 + 392 = 587\nDiscounted value: 587 * 0.9 = 528.3.\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer.

I need to keep more than just item 3. I need to consider my outside offer and ensure I have something better. I should offer a deal that provides me more items that are worth more to me. I will offer the player 2 the items I value less. \nLet's offer player 2 one of each item type. [1,1,1,1,1].\n    *   Items I keep :\n        *  0 items of 1: 0 * 42 = 0\n        * 2 items of 2: 2 * 65 = 130\n        * 3 items of 3: 3 * 98 = 294\n        *  4 items of 4: 4 * 2 = 8\n        *  2 items of 5: 2 * 24 = 48\n    *   Total value: 130+294+8+48 = 480\n    *   Discounted value: 480 * 0.9 = 432\n\nThis is not good enough either. Let's try offering the other player only item 4, all of it. [0,0,0,5,0]\n    * Items I keep\n        * 1 item of 1 : 42\n        * 3 items of 2 : 195\n        * 4 items of 3 : 392\n        * 0 items of 4 : 0\n        * 3 items of 5 : 72\n     * Total: 701\n     * Discounted Total: 701 * 0.9 = 630.9\nOkay, this is great! \nI will make a counteroffer to the other player of [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I want to keep as much of item 2, item 3, and potentially item 4 for myself. Player 1 has offered me 5 of item 4. This is not valuable for me. Item 1 and 5 are also not valuable to me. Let's start with a counteroffer where I take back my units of item 4 and offer player 1 a unit of the lowest value item.\n\n**Counteroffer Calculation**\nCounteroffer: I offer Player 1 [0,0,0,0,1]\n* I keep 1 of item 1 = 1 * 4 = 4\n* I keep 3 of item 2 = 3 * 87 = 261\n* I keep 4 of item 3 = 4 * 82 = 328\n* I keep 5 of item 4 = 5 * 25 = 125\n* I keep 2 of item 5 = 2 * 1 = 2\n* Total Value for me = 4 + 261 + 328 + 125 + 2 = 720\n* Discounted value for me = 720 * 0.9 = 648\n\nThis is much higher than my outside offer and very beneficial for me.

This is our baseline for evaluating any counteroffer we might make.\n3. **Optimal First Counteroffer:** In the first round, Player 1 has an advantage by being the first to propose a deal. As the first mover, Player 1 should make an offer that will try to secure the vast majority of items with high value while still being high enough for Player 2 to accept over their outside offer. Given that we do not know the outside offer of player 2 we will try to keep as many high value items as we can. Therefore, we will offer Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5, and we will keep the rest.\n\n**Calculate the Value of the Counteroffer**\n*   We keep:\n    * Item 1: 4 * 92 = 368\n    * Item 2: 2 * 100 = 200\n    * Item 3: 1 * 23 = 23\n    * Item 4: 1 * 91 = 91\n    * Item 5: 4 * 19 = 76\n*   Total Value: 368 + 200 + 23 + 91 + 76 = 758\n    \n*If Player 2 accepts the offer, my value is 758. This is lower than our outside offer of 786, so we should try to get more.*\n\nLet's try an offer that yields a higher value for us than our outside option. Let's offer player 2 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 5, keeping the rest.\n\n*   We keep:\n    * Item 1: 4 * 92 = 368\n    * Item 2: 2 * 100 = 200\n    * Item 3: 1 * 23 = 23\n    * Item 4: 1 * 91 = 91\n    * Item 5: 4 * 19 = 76\n*   Total Value: 368 + 200 + 23 + 91 + 76 = 758\n\nStill not enough. We will increase our offer until our value falls below 786. Let's offer player 2 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 5.\n\n*   We keep:\n    * Item 1: 3 * 92 = 276\n    * Item 2: 2 * 100 = 200\n    * Item 3: 1 * 23 = 23\n    * Item 4: 1 * 91 = 91\n    * Item 5: 4 * 19 = 76\n*   Total Value: 276 + 200 + 23 + 91 + 76 = 666\n\nThis is too low. It looks like we should aim to give away 1 unit of each item 1 and item 5 and keep the rest. That gives us 758.\nSince we cannot guarantee that this will be accepted, but it is better than walking away we will try this as our initial offer.\n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Thus accepting the current offer is not a good idea.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nSince the current offer is less than my outside offer, I should not accept. It's round 2, so I have one more counteroffer to make. Walking away is a guaranteed payout of my outside option discounted, which is 786 * 0.9 = 707.4. I need to try and get a better deal for myself with a counter offer.\nLet me compute the total value I would get if i kept all the items:\n*   5 units of item 1: 5 * 92 = 460\n*   2 units of item 2: 2 * 100 = 200\n*   1 units of item 3: 1 * 23 = 23\n*   1 units of item 4: 1 * 91 = 91\n*   5 units of item 5: 5 * 19 = 95\n*   Total Value = 460 + 200 + 23 + 91 + 95 = 869. This is my maximum possible total value.\n\nI have to make a counteroffer. I will try to capture as much value as I can. Player 2 previously offered me 2 units of item 1 and 2 units of item 5. Let's offer them 0 units of items 2,3, and 4 and offer a bit more than in my previous offer for item 1 and 5. Let me offer them [0,0,0,0,0], this means I would get all the items and would result in value = 869. Discounted value is 869 * 0.9 = 782.1, which is higher than my outside offer of 707.4 in round 2. Let's also try offering them [1,0,0,0,1] which will give me a value of 222 more than if I offer them [2,0,0,0,2]. However, my value if I keep [4,2,1,1,4] will be 4 * 92 + 2 * 100 + 1 * 23 + 1 * 91 + 4 * 19 = 368 + 200 + 23 + 91 + 76 = 758. So, discounted will be 758 * 0.9 = 682.2.\nLet me offer them [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This would give me my total value 869. Discounted value is 869 * 0.9 = 782.1 which is higher than discounted value of my outside offer (707.4) in round 2.\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer where I offer the other player nothing.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Thus I would need to get more than 521/0.9 = 579.\n\n**Counteroffer Strategy:** I will propose a counteroffer giving a higher share of each item to myself, aiming for a value greater than 579. I will try to get the majority of every item. Let's offer [1, 1, 1, 0, 0] to Player 1. This means I would keep [3, 3, 4, 2, 2].\n\n**My Value for Counteroffer:**\n*   3 units of item 1: 3 * 57 = 171\n*   3 units of item 2: 3 * 45 = 135\n*   4 units of item 3: 4 * 52 = 208\n*   2 units of item 4: 2 * 35 = 70\n*   2 units of item 5: 2 * 53 = 106\n*   Total value of counteroffer: 171 + 135 + 208 + 70 + 106 = 690\n\nThis is significantly greater than my outside offer and above 579, so it is preferable even with the 0.9 discount of a second round.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Since we are at round 2 the value is then multiplied by 0.9^1 = 0.9.\nDiscounted Value: 294 * 0.9 = 264.6\n\n**Step 2: Compare to my outside offer.**\n\nMy outside offer is 521. The current offer discounted is 264.6.  264.6 < 521\n\n**Step 3: Determine my action**\n    Since the discounted value of the current offer is less than my outside offer, it would be better for me to walk away from this negotiation. Since it is round 2 there is still an opportunity for negotiation.\n**Step 4: Consider a Counteroffer**\n    If I make a counteroffer I'm likely to get a counteroffer back which would come in round 3. In round 3 if Player 1 makes an offer that is worse than my walk-away value I will walk, and they will be no better off. Thus, I should be trying to maximise my total value by making a counteroffer in this round.\n    I need to figure out an offer that is good for me, but also good enough that player 1 may accept it. Given that player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 1], if they offered me 1 of everything I have a value of 294. If they kept all of the rest and I calculated that value to them it would be 3x of item 1, 3x of item 2, 3x of item 3, 1x of item 4 and 1x of item 5 and their values are unknown. If I offered the other player less than [2,2,2,1,1] they might walk.\n    My total value for all items is 844. If I were to receive half of everything my value would be 422. If I offer 1 more of each item, meaning [2,2,3,1,1] they would have [2,2,2,1,1] which is the offer they made at the end of round 1. \n    My value if they accept [2,2,3,1,1] would be 2*57+2*45+2*52+1*35+1*53 = 114 + 90 + 104 + 35 + 53 = 396. If they accept this then the discounted value would be 396 * 0.9 = 356.4, which is less than my outside offer but could be more than their discounted outside offer.\n    My alternative is to give them nothing and walk away. This would give me 521.\nI will offer player 1 [1, 1, 1, 0, 0] which is my offer from the previous round.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

The previous offers show that player 2 wants mostly items 1, 2 and 3, with small preference for items 4 and 5. Player 2 has been asking for [1,1,1,0,0]. \nIf I were to offer something that would benefit me, I should try to keep as much of items 2 and 3 as possible. Let me look at what I would get if I offer player 2 2 units of 1, 2 of 2, 3 of 3, 1 of 4 and 1 of 5.\nMy value with that offer would be\n    * Item 1: 4-2 = 2 * 13 = 26\n    * Item 2: 4-2 = 2 * 75 = 150\n    * Item 3: 5-3 = 2 * 73 = 146\n    * Item 4: 2-1 = 1 * 21 = 21\n    * Item 5: 2-1 = 1 * 26 = 26\nTotal = 26 + 150 + 146 + 21 + 26 = 369\n\nNow let me see what happens if I offer player 2 the same as my round 1 offer. I would keep:\n* Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2 * 13 = 26\n* Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2 * 75 = 150\n* Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3 * 73 = 219\n* Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1 * 21 = 21\n* Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1 * 26 = 26\nTotal = 26 + 150 + 219 + 21 + 26 = 442\n\nThis is better than 369.\nNow, let's look at my counteroffer options for this round. Player 2 offered [1,1,1,0,0]. If I offer player 2 [1, 1, 1, 0, 0] as well, this would mean I would get:\n* Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 * 13 = 39\n* Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 * 75 = 225\n* Item 3: 5 - 1 = 4 * 73 = 292\n* Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2 * 21 = 42\n* Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 * 26 = 52\nTotal = 39 + 225 + 292 + 42 + 52 = 650. This seems like the highest value counteroffer to make that is likely to be accepted.\n\nSince it is the last round and a counteroffer from player 2 would be counted as a walk, making a counteroffer will secure me a better deal than accepting the current offer.\n\nTherefore I will make the counteroffer [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

The discounted value of the current offer is 883.8, which is significantly less than my outside offer.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside option, I will make a counter offer. In round 1 I offered [0,1,1,1,1]. Player 1 offered [0,3,2,2,2] and then came down to [0,1,1,1,0]. It seems like player 1 wants some items of type 2,3, and 4 and doesn't seem to value the other types very much. I value items of type 1 and 3 highly. \nI'll make a counter offer that focuses on those items, giving player 1 some of the items they seemed to value earlier while still maximizing my gain over my outside offer. \nI'll offer Player 1 [0, 2, 2, 1, 0]. This will leave me with [2, 4, 3, 3, 4].\n\n**Value of Counter Offer to Me:**\n* Item 1: 2 * 94 = 188\n* Item 2: 4 * 45 = 180\n* Item 3: 3 * 77 = 231\n* Item 4: 3 * 15 = 45\n* Item 5: 4 * 54 = 216\n* **Total Value:** 188+180+231+45+216 = 860\n\n**Discounted Value of Counter Offer:** Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9\n* **Discounted Total Value:** 860 * 0.9 = 774\n\nSince the round is not the last round, I can make a counter offer. However, I should consider the value of the counter offer in the third round. To make this more appealing to Player 1, I will offer [0,2,2,1,1]. This leaves me with [2,4,3,3,3].\n\n* Item 1: 2 * 94 = 188\n* Item 2: 4 * 45 = 180\n* Item 3: 3 * 77 = 231\n* Item 4: 3 * 15 = 45\n* Item 5: 3 * 54 = 162\n* **Total Value:** 188+180+231+45+162 = 806\n* **Discounted Total Value:** 806*0.9 = 725.4\n\nSince the current discounted value of the offer (883.8) is much less than my outside offer of 1083, and the best counter offer I can make is far below my outside offer even when discounted, I should walk away.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

It is in my interest to continue negotiations rather than take the outside offer.\n\n**Analysis of Previous Offers:**\n*   Round 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 6, 3, 4]. This is how much player 1 was offering to player 2.\n*   Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 1, 0, 0]. This is how much player 2 was offering to player 1.\n\n**Counteroffer Strategy:**\n\nI need to decide on a counteroffer to give to Player 2. Since I value item 2 highly, and player 2 has previously offered me 3 units, I could try to get more of item 2. Since they offered very little of items 1, 4, and 5, I will not pursue those items. Player 2 values Item 3 somewhat since they did offer me 1 unit.\nI will try to offer less of item 3 and more of item 2, hoping to move towards an agreement.\n\nI will offer [2, 1, 3, 2, 2]\n\n**Counteroffer Calculation:**\n\n2 units of item 1: 2 * 18 = 36\n1 unit of item 2: 1 * 80 = 80\n3 units of item 3: 3 * 33 = 99\n2 units of item 4: 2 * 13 = 26\n2 unit of item 5: 2 * 72 = 144\n\nIf I give the above to Player 2, I keep:\n2 units of item 1: 2 * 18 = 36\n4 units of item 2: 4 * 80 = 320\n3 units of item 3: 3 * 33 = 99\n2 units of item 4: 2 * 13 = 26\n5 unit of item 5: 5 * 72 = 360\nTotal value for me = 36 + 320 + 99 + 26 + 360 = 841\nAdjusted value = 841 * 0.9 = 756.9\n\n**Decision:**\nMy discounted value for accepting the current offer is 245.7. The counteroffer would yield me 756.9 if player 2 accepts it.\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer [2, 1, 3, 2, 2]\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 2, 2]}\n",

Given all of that, it is necessary for me to offer something that Player 2 would be indifferent to taking or walking away from.\n\n*   **Total value of my items:** (4 * 21) + (3 * 39) + (5 * 52) + (2 * 29) + (6 * 98) = 84 + 117 + 260 + 58 + 588 = 1107.\n\nGiven that I don't know anything about Player 2, I will begin by offering them a value roughly equivalent to my outside offer, and keeping the remaining value for myself. I do not know the other player's total possible value from the total items available, so i will start by giving the other player less than half of the available items. I will offer 1 item of item 1, 1 item of item 2, 1 item of item 3, 1 item of item 4, 1 item of item 5.\n\nThis would leave me with:\n3 of item 1, value of 3 * 21 = 63\n2 of item 2, value of 2 * 39 = 78\n4 of item 3, value of 4 * 52 = 208\n1 of item 4, value of 1 * 29 = 29\n5 of item 5, value of 5 * 98 = 490\nTotal value = 868\n\n**Decision**\n\nOffering the other player:\n1 item of item 1\n1 item of item 2\n1 item of item 3\n1 item of item 4\n1 item of item 5\n\nThis leaves me with value 868 > 312 (my outside offer).\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I will first consider giving Player 2 half the total available units, and calculate my value if this was the outcome, to use as an initial target.\n4.  **Calculating Total Items to Keep:** If I give half of the items to player 2, that would be 1 unit of item 1, 3.5 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 2.5 unit of item 4 and 2 unit of item 5 to player 2, but as these must be integers I will start by offering [1,3,2,2,2] units to the player 2. This would mean I keep [1,4,2,3,2]. \n5. **My Value from Initial Offer:**\n    * 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 7 = 7\n    * 4 units of item 2: 4 * 60 = 240\n    * 2 units of item 3: 2 * 5 = 10\n    * 3 units of item 4: 3 * 15 = 45\n    * 2 units of item 5: 2 * 2 = 4\n    * Total = 7 + 240 + 10 + 45 + 4 = 306. Since 306 > 231, this is a worthwhile starting point for my initial counteroffer, however I will add a little more to myself as I have the first move.\n6. **New Initial Offer:** I will try to offer less to Player 2 to see if they accept, offering [0,3,1,2,1].\n7. **My Value from New Initial Offer:**\n    * 2 unit of item 1: 2 * 7 = 14\n    * 4 units of item 2: 4 * 60 = 240\n    * 3 units of item 3: 3 * 5 = 15\n    * 3 units of item 4: 3 * 15 = 45\n    * 3 units of item 5: 3 * 2 = 6\n    * Total = 14 + 240 + 15 + 45 + 6 = 320.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1 in the first round.\n\n**Understanding the Game**\n\n*   **Goal:** Maximize my discounted value from the negotiation, considering my outside offer.\n*   **Items:** 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 6 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n*   **My Values:** 99 for item 1, 52 for item 2, 49 for item 3, 42 for item 4, 90 for item 5.\n*   **My Outside Offer:** 140.\n*   **Discount Factor:** 0.9 per round.\n*   **Rounds:** 3.\n*   **Initial Situation:** No offer on the table, so I have to make the first move.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Total Value Calculation:** My total value of all items is (3 * 99) + (4 * 52) + (4 * 49) + (6 * 42) + (4 * 90) = 297 + 208 + 196 + 252 + 360 = 1313.\n\n2.  **Considering the Outside Offer:** My outside offer value is 140, which is my guaranteed fallback. Any deal I accept has to be worth at least 140 after discounting (if any) to make sense.\n\n3.  **First Round Strategy:** Since this is the first round and we have a discount factor of 0.9, it makes sense to be a little more aggressive. I want to try to capture as much of the value as possible since the value is not discounted at this round.\n    *   Making an offer that gives a large portion of the items to Player 2 is risky, as it could lead to a quick accept, especially when considering their private values are all in the range [1,101]. Player 2 can easily get a much higher value from some of those items.\n    *   Making a low offer will likely lead to a counteroffer, which means I would need to make a decision in the second round.\n\n4.  **Counteroffer Calculation:** I'll consider making an initial counteroffer that is very beneficial to myself. This allows me to see Player 2's reaction and learn something about them. I want to keep a good amount of the valuable items. Let's start by offering player 2 only a small amount of each item.\n\n**Proposed Initial Counteroffer**\n\nI will offer Player 2 one unit of items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n*   Item 1: 1 unit\n*   Item 2: 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 1 unit\n*   Item 4: 1 unit\n*   Item 5: 1 unit\n\n**Value of My Counteroffer**\n\nIf Player 2 accepts my counteroffer, my share will be:\n    * Item 1: 2 * 99 = 198\n    * Item 2: 3 * 52 = 156\n    * Item 3: 3 * 49 = 147\n    * Item 4: 5 * 42 = 210\n    * Item 5: 3 * 90 = 270\n\nTotal Value: 198 + 156 + 147 + 210 + 270 = 981.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n**My Private Values:**\n* Item 1: 8\n* Item 2: 10\n* Item 3: 24\n* Item 4: 57\n* Item 5: 2\n\n**My Total Value of All Items:**\n* (6 * 8) + (2 * 10) + (4 * 24) + (1 * 57) + (6 * 2) = 48 + 20 + 96 + 57 + 12 = 233\n\n**My Outside Offer:** 224\n\n**Round 1 Analysis:**\n\nSince this is round 1 and there is no existing offer, I can either walk away immediately or make a counteroffer.\n\nMy goal is to maximize my value, given that my outside offer is worth 224. Any offer I make should provide me with a value greater than or equal to my outside offer. Because the other agent also has an outside offer, it is unlikely they will accept anything that provides them with less value than their outside offer, therefore my initial offer should be one that is likely to be accepted.\n\nSince I want to maximize my own profit, a reasonable strategy is to offer a deal where I get the majority of the items with the highest value for me and give the other player a larger amount of the items I value less. Let's start with an offer that gives player 2 an equal share of the total items. The total number of each item is (6, 2, 4, 1, 6). We will divide by two, rounding down to be conservative in calculating what is given to Player 2. This gives (3, 1, 2, 0, 3) to Player 2. I keep the remainder of each item for myself.\n\n**Proposed Offer to Player 2:**\n* Item 1: 3\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 2\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 3\n\n**My Remaining Items:**\n* Item 1: 3\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 2\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 3\n\n**Value to Me of Remaining Items:**\n* (3 * 8) + (1 * 10) + (2 * 24) + (1 * 57) + (3 * 2) = 24 + 10 + 48 + 57 + 6 = 145\n\nSince this is lower than my outside offer I need to revise my offer, keeping in mind that I must offer at least something to player 2. Let us offer a much smaller amount and recalculate the value to me. Let us offer Player 2 one of each item.\n\n**Revised Offer to Player 2:**\n* Item 1: 1\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 1\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 1\n\n**My Remaining Items:**\n* Item 1: 5\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 3\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 5\n\n**Value to Me of Remaining Items:**\n* (5 * 8) + (1 * 10) + (3 * 24) + (0 * 57) + (5 * 2) = 40 + 10 + 72 + 0 + 10 = 132\n\nThis value is too low, less than my outside offer. It is clear that I should keep all of the item 4, because it has the highest value, and try to balance the distribution of the remaining items. My private values are 8, 10, 24, 57, 2. I will therefore keep all of item 4 and a large proportion of item 3. A possible offer to player 2 is 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, and 1 of item 5.\n\n**Revised Offer to Player 2:**\n* Item 1: 2\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 1\n\n**My Remaining Items:**\n* Item 1: 4\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 4\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 5\n\n**Value to Me of Remaining Items:**\n* (4 * 8) + (1 * 10) + (4 * 24) + (1 * 57) + (5 * 2) = 32 + 10 + 96 + 57 + 10 = 205\n\nThis value is still too low, I require a value greater than 224.\nLet's try to offer them less of the more valuable items and more of the less valuable items.\nI will keep all of Item 4, keep most of item 3 and keep most of item 1.\nI will offer 2 of item 5, and 1 of item 2.\n\n**Revised Offer to Player 2:**\n* Item 1: 0\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 2\n\n**My Remaining Items:**\n* Item 1: 6\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 4\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 4\n\n**Value to Me of Remaining Items:**\n* (6 * 8) + (1 * 10) + (4 * 24) + (1 * 57) + (4 * 2) = 48 + 10 + 96 + 57 + 8 = 219\n\nThis is close, but still below my outside offer. I will instead offer player 2 1 of Item 5, keep everything else, and recalculate\n\n**Revised Offer to Player 2:**\n* Item 1: 0\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 1\n\n**My Remaining Items:**\n* Item 1: 6\n* Item 2: 2\n* Item 3: 4\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 5\n\n**Value to Me of Remaining Items:**\n* (6 * 8) + (2 * 10) + (4 * 24) + (1 * 57) + (5 * 2) = 48 + 20 + 96 + 57 + 10 = 231\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer. Given that I want a value greater than 224, and my total value of all items is only 233, it is difficult to make a counteroffer to player 2 that will get me above that threshold. I will therefore walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

I will make a counteroffer, rather than walk.\n2.  **Outside Offer as a Baseline:** My outside offer (463) is my guaranteed minimum. I should only accept deals (either now or in the future) that are worth more than this to me after applying the discount factor.\n3.  **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I will try to make an offer that is attractive to the other player (Player 2) while still maximizing my value, while keeping in mind my outside offer. I will try a 50-50 split of all items, which works out well. I will also offer the full amounts of some less valuable items to see how player 2 reacts in future rounds.\n4.  **Discounting:**  I need to factor in the discount rate. If we reach later rounds without a deal, both players' offers will be worth less. It is better to close the deal early.\n\n**Calculating a Possible Counteroffer**\n\nI will propose offering Player 2 half of each of item 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, rounding up to ensure we're within available item totals. This means offering Player 2 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 3 of item 5 and I take the rest.\nThis would leave me: 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 2 of item 5.\n\n**My values for this offer:**\n\n*   Item 1: 0 * 88 = 0\n*   Item 2: 1 * 79 = 79\n*   Item 3: 2 * 68 = 136\n*   Item 4: 1 * 16 = 16\n*   Item 5: 2 * 40 = 80\nTotal = 311\nThis is less than my outside offer, so I should not make this offer.\n\nI will propose offering Player 2 half of each of item 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, rounding down to ensure we're within available item totals.

This leaves me with 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nMy value for this allocation is:\n(2 * 3) + (3 * 12) + (2 * 7) + (1 * 73) + (2 * 55) = 6 + 36 + 14 + 73 + 110 = 239\n\nSince 239 is greater than my outside offer of 205, this is a better option than walking away.

Therefore, I should not accept. Since this is round 1, and we have 3 rounds to negotiate I should make a counteroffer. I want to try and get as much value as possible, but I also need to ensure I at least get my reservation value, and I know that Player 1 has a reservation value as well, so I cannot ask for everything. I can take a chance and offer Player 1 nothing, but they will most certainly reject this, I also know that if I offered them the same offer they offered to me, they would probably reject this as they would want to increase their valuation too. \n\nLet's try offering player 1 a small number of items. Player 1 offered me [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], meaning they kept [0, 6, 0, 0, 3].\nLets propose an offer where they get 0 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 1 of item 5, meaning I get 1 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\nMy value would be 1*97 + 3*56 + 0*26 + 1*61 + 2*53 = 97 + 168 + 0 + 61 + 106 = 432. This is lower than my outside offer value so I'm not sure if this is the optimal approach.\n\nInstead of offering a minimal amount, I'm going to start by asking for most of the value and see how it goes. I know the total value for me of the items is 653, and if I can get close to this I will be better than my outside offer and hopefully get player 1 to agree before round 3. I will offer player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This will mean I will receive [1, 5, 0, 1, 3]. The value of this offer for me is 1*97 + 5*56 + 0*26 + 1*61 + 3*53 = 97 + 280 + 0 + 61 + 159 = 597, which is less than my outside value. Lets try offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would receive [1,6,0,1,3] and my total value would be 653. This is higher than my outside offer so this is a good start.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

So currently, I (Player 1) am being offered nothing, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n*   **My Private Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 45\n    *   Item 2: 87\n    *   Item 3: 69\n    *   Item 4: 66\n    *   Item 5: 83\n*   **My Outside Offer:** 401\n*   **Discount Factor (gamma):** 0.9\n*   **My Current Offer Value:** Since I'm being offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the current offer is worth 0 to me.\n\n**Options:**\n\n1.  **ACCEPT:** Accepting the current offer would give me a value of 0 * 0.9^(2-1) = 0.  This is much less than my outside offer of 401.\n2.  **WALK:** Walking away gives me a value of 401 * 0.9^(2-1) = 360.9\n3.  **COUNTEROFFER:** I need to decide if I can make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, which is equal to 360.9 at this round due to the discount factor. \n\n**Counteroffer Strategy:**\n\nMy goal is to maximize my value. Given that I have 1 unit of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5, and player 2 has not yet indicated any preferences, I will assume they value these items similarly to myself. I should make a counteroffer which gives the player some items to entice them into accepting it. To maximize my potential gain, I should offer them items where I have more to give, in order to keep as much as possible for myself.\n\nLet's consider offering player 2 half of what I have as a potential counteroffer for them: item 1: 0, item 2: 3, item 3: 0, item 4: 0, item 5: 1. That means I would keep for myself item 1: 1, item 2: 3, item 3: 0, item 4: 1, item 5: 2.\n\nValue of keeping items 1, 3, 1, 2 is (1*45 + 3*87 + 0*69 + 1*66 + 2*83) * 0.9^(2-1) = (45 + 261 + 0 + 66 + 166)*0.9 = 538*0.9 = 484.2. This is better than walking away with 360.9, and better than the current offer which has a value of 0.\n\n**Action:**\n\nI will make the counteroffer of giving player 2 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

I need to make an initial offer that maximizes my potential outcome, considering my outside offer.  I want to secure as much value as possible for myself, but I also need to leave enough on the table for Player 2 to accept to avoid walking. I need to consider that any deal this round will be multiplied by gamma^0 which is 1, for round 2 it would be gamma^1 = 0.9 and round 3 it would be gamma^2 = 0.81. So I should try for the most value now and if rejected then make a slightly worse offer for myself in round 2 and even worse again in round 3.\n\nA good starting point would be to offer Player 2 items for which I have a lower value, while keeping items for which I have higher value. Let's consider offering a portion of items 1, 3 and 5 while keeping most of items 2 and 4. I could try offering:\n\n*   Item 1: 0 to me, 1 to P2\n*   Item 2: 6 to me, 0 to P2\n*   Item 3: 1 to me, 1 to P2\n*   Item 4: 4 to me, 0 to P2\n*   Item 5: 3 to me, 3 to P2\n\nThis would result in a value for me of: (1*10) + (6*62) + (1*2) + (4*96) + (3*3) = 10 + 372 + 2 + 384 + 9 = 777. Let's test this and see if we need to change it. Since we want to be greedy let's first try to keep everything we value more:\n\n*   Item 1: 0 to me, 1 to P2\n*   Item 2: 6 to me, 0 to P2\n*   Item 3: 0 to me, 2 to P2\n*   Item 4: 4 to me, 0 to P2\n*   Item 5: 0 to me, 6 to P2\n\nThis would be valued at (1 * 10) + (6 * 62) + (0 * 2) + (4 * 96) + (0 * 3) = 10 + 372 + 0 + 384 + 0 = 766.\n\nLet's try another offer:\n*   Item 1: 0 to me, 1 to P2\n*   Item 2: 6 to me, 0 to P2\n*   Item 3: 1 to me, 1 to P2\n*   Item 4: 4 to me, 0 to P2\n*   Item 5: 3 to me, 3 to P2\n\nThis gives me (0 * 10) + (6 * 62) + (1 * 2) + (4 * 96) + (3 * 3) = 0 + 372 + 2 + 384 + 9 = 767.\n\nI'm still going to try and be greedy so I'll offer the items with the lowest value to the other player\n\n* Item 1: 0 to me, 1 to Player 2\n* Item 2: 6 to me, 0 to Player 2\n* Item 3: 0 to me, 2 to Player 2\n* Item 4: 4 to me, 0 to Player 2\n* Item 5: 0 to me, 6 to Player 2\n\nThis offer would give me a total value of: (0 * 10) + (6 * 62) + (0 * 2) + (4 * 96) + (0 * 3) = 0 + 372 + 0 + 384 + 0 = 756\n\nI think I'll stick with my original offer, as I don't have any current offer to consider, and I still want to maximize my value.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 3]}\n```\n",

I need to determine an offer that is good for me but might also be acceptable to the other player. I need to account for the discount factor, so I must consider the fact that this is round 1.

However, I do not know their values.\n\nI will offer a value to Player 1 that is equivalent to half of my value rounded up and the remainder to me. \nTotal value of all items to me = (1 * 100) + (6 * 95) + (2 * 56) + (4 * 90) + (6 * 83) = 100 + 570 + 112 + 360 + 498 = 1640\nMy half: 1640 / 2 = 820\n\nI will attempt to achieve the following:\nPlayer 1 receives an amount that gives them at least 820 value, while i maximize the amount I receive.\nI am unsure what player 1 values each item at so i will attempt a fair trade and offer half of each item to player 1, if possible, rounding up the offering where the amount of the item is odd.\n\nSo my counteroffer will be:\n- Item 1: 1/2 = 1 units to player 1 (rounding up)\n- Item 2: 6 / 2 = 3 units to player 1\n- Item 3: 2 / 2 = 1 unit to player 1\n- Item 4: 4 / 2 = 2 units to player 1\n- Item 5: 6 / 2 = 3 units to player 1\n\nSo, I will offer [1, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 1, 2, 3]}\n```\n",

The total number of items are 12 units. Let's aim to get around 7/12th of the total value for myself, meaning roughly a 5/12 split. The goal here is to make an offer to the second player that is at a valuation higher than our own outside offer, to encourage negotiations and avoid either player walking away immediately. Since it's the first round, we can start with a less generous offer to see how it plays.\n\n    *   Give Player 2: 1 item 1, 0 items of item 2, 2 items of item 3, 1 item 4, and 1 item 5\n    *   Keep for myself: 1 item 1, 1 item 2, 2 items of item 3, 2 items of item 4, and 1 item 5\n    * Player 1 Value:  (1 * 28) + (1 * 38) + (2 * 46) + (2 * 85) + (1 * 1) = 28 + 38 + 92 + 170 + 1 = 329\n    * Player 2 Value:  (1 * 28) + (0 * 38) + (2 * 46) + (1 * 85) + (1 * 1) = 28 + 0 + 92 + 85 + 1 = 206\n\nThis offers the other player 206. This seems like a more balanced split that favors me slightly.\n\n**Action:**\n\nI will make this a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

The current offer's value (318) is less than my outside offer. Therefore, I should not accept.\n\n4.  **Consider a Counteroffer:** Since this is round 1, I have two more rounds to negotiate. A counteroffer is appropriate in this situation as the initial offer does not meet my outside option. I should aim to increase the total value I receive above 374.\n\n5.  **Calculate Potential Counteroffer**\n    Player 1 offered me [1,0,2,1,1]. This means that player 1 is keeping [1,1,2,2,1] for themselves. For me to receive more value than my outside option, I need to receive higher value items.\n    I value item 1 and 2 much higher, and player 1 seems to be keeping those for themselves. My highest valued item is item 1 (74). Second highest is item 2 (73).\n    I will offer player 1 all of item 3, 4, and 5, and 1 unit of item 1 and keep 1 of item 1 and all of item 2 for myself.\n    The counter offer will be [1,0,4,3,2] and therefore I will keep [1,1,0,0,0] for myself.\n\n6. **Value of potential counteroffer to me:**\n    Item 1: 1 * 74 = 74\n    Item 2: 1 * 73 = 73\n    Item 3: 0 * 36 = 0\n    Item 4: 0 * 37 = 0\n    Item 5: 0 * 25 = 0\n    Total value = 147. This is less than the outside offer and so I must modify the offer.\n   \n    I will offer to give them all of item 3, 4, and 5, and 0 of item 1 and keep all of items 1 and 2.\n    The counteroffer will be [0,0,4,3,2]. This will leave me with [2,1,0,0,0].\n\n7. **Value of this modified counteroffer:**\n    Item 1: 2 * 74 = 148\n    Item 2: 1 * 73 = 73\n    Item 3: 0 * 36 = 0\n    Item 4: 0 * 37 = 0\n    Item 5: 0 * 25 = 0\n    Total Value: 221\n    This is still less than my outside offer, but is a reasonable move to test their valuation of these items.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 3, 2]}\n```\n",

Lets propose a counteroffer where I only give the minimum to player 2 of each:\n* 0 of item 1\n* 0 of item 2\n* 0 of item 3\n* 0 of item 4\n* 0 of item 5\nThis would mean I keep:\n* 2 units of item 1: 2 * 28 = 56\n* 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 38 = 38\n* 4 units of item 3: 4 * 46 = 184\n* 3 units of item 4: 3 * 85 = 255\n* 2 units of item 5: 2 * 1 = 2\nTotal = 535.

Since this is round 2, any outcome is multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\n**Evaluating the Current Offer**\n\nThe current offer gives me 0 of each item. This is worth 0 to me.\nTherefore, the discounted value of accepting the current offer to me is 0 * 0.9 = 0. Since this is less than my outside offer of 374, I should not accept this.\n\n**Evaluating a Potential Counteroffer**\n\nSince it is round 2, there is a possibility of making a counteroffer. However if this counteroffer is rejected then, in the final round, I will not be able to make another counteroffer and will have to choose between the current offer, or walking away. In this case, it is likely that I should attempt to achieve an outcome that exceeds my outside offer in this round.\n\nTo compute the value of a potential counteroffer, first I have to compute how many items I would keep.\nIf I was to keep all items, I would have a total value of 526.\nMy outside offer value is 374. So the discounted value of my outside offer is 374 * 0.9 = 336.6\nTherefore I would need a discounted outcome greater than 336.6 to justify negotiating further.\nLet's construct an offer that attempts to maximize my payoff. I must ensure it is greater than my outside offer discounted value. I will try and keep as many items as possible while still making it at least slightly better than their current offer.\nLet us consider offering Player 1 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 3, and 1 unit of item 4, which they will likely accept if they are rational.\nThis would give me 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\nThe value of this to me is (1 * 74) + (1 * 73) + (3 * 36) + (2 * 37) + (2 * 25) = 74 + 73 + 108 + 74 + 50 = 379.\nThe discounted value to me would be 379 * 0.9 = 341.1\nSince this is greater than 336.6, I should make this counteroffer.\n\n**Decision**\n\nSince the current offer is very poor and I have calculated a beneficial counteroffer, I will make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

I need to decide whether to walk away immediately or make a counteroffer. If I walk away, I get 827. My goal is to maximize my value. I need to formulate an offer that is better than walking away to myself.\n\nA naive offer would be to offer half of each item to Player 2. This would require me to calculate the value of keeping the other half for myself. Let's calculate the values of keeping each item type:\n* Item 1: 4 / 2 = 2 units. Value: 2 * 44 = 88\n* Item 2: 2 / 2 = 1 unit. Value: 1 * 23 = 23\n* Item 3: 4 / 2 = 2 units. Value: 2 * 24 = 48\n* Item 4: 5 / 2 = 2.5. We can't give half, so lets round up to 3 to give to the other player, and 2 to myself. Value: 2 * 99 = 198\n* Item 5: 2 / 2 = 1 unit. Value: 1 * 63 = 63\n* Total value: 88+23+48+198+63 = 420\n\nThis is much lower than my outside offer. Instead, a better option is to propose an offer that leaves me with the items I highly value. For example, let's try offering very little of the most valuable items (4 and 5) to player 2. Let's try offering 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5. \n\n*   **My Offer to Player 2:** [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    *   **My Remaining Items:** \n        *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2. Value: 2 * 44 = 88\n        *   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1. Value: 1 * 23 = 23\n        *   Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2. Value: 2 * 24 = 48\n        *   Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4. Value: 4 * 99 = 396\n        *   Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1. Value: 1 * 63 = 63\n    *   **Total Value of My Remaining Items:** 88 + 23 + 48 + 396 + 63= 618 + 63 = 618\n\nThis is also less than my outside offer, so let's try offering just 1 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5 to player 2.\n\n*   **My Offer to Player 2:** [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n    *  **My Remaining Items:**\n        *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3. Value: 3 * 44 = 132\n        *   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2. Value: 2 * 23 = 46\n        *   Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3. Value: 3 * 24 = 72\n        *   Item 4: 5 - 0 = 5. Value: 5 * 99 = 495\n        *   Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2. Value: 2 * 63 = 126\n    *   **Total Value of My Remaining Items:** 132 + 46 + 72 + 495 + 126 = 871\n\nThis is better than my outside offer!

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Round:** 2\n*   **My Values:** Item 1: 44, Item 2: 23, Item 3: 24, Item 4: 99, Item 5: 63\n*   **My Outside Offer:** 827\n*   **Current Offer (to me):** [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]\n*   **Previous Offers:**\n    *   Round 1, Player 1 (me): [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] (what I offered to Player 2)\n    *   Round 1, Player 2: [0, 1, 0, 3, 0] (what Player 2 offered to me)\n*   **Discount Factor:** 0.9\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the value of the current offer.**\n\nThe current offer to me is [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]. This means I receive:\n*   0 units of item 1\n*   1 unit of item 2\n*   0 units of item 3\n*   3 units of item 4\n*   0 units of item 5\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n(0 * 44) + (1 * 23) + (0 * 24) + (3 * 99) + (0 * 63) = 0 + 23 + 0 + 297 + 0 = 320\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the discounted value of the current offer.**\n\nSince it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9\n\nThe discounted value of the current offer is 320 * 0.9 = 288.\n\n**Step 3: Compare to my outside offer.**\n\nMy outside offer is worth 827. The discounted value of the current offer (288) is much lower than my outside offer. Therefore, I should not accept the current offer.\n\n**Step 4: Consider making a counteroffer.**\nSince I won't accept the current offer, I need to decide if I should try a counter offer or walk away. It is round 2, so I still have an opportunity for negotiation. I will try to propose a counter offer which gives me more value than my outside offer while giving Player 2 an incentive to accept it.\n\nLet me propose an offer that gives more to myself and is not unreasonable for Player 2. In the previous round, Player 1 proposed [1,0,1,0,0] and Player 2 proposed [0,1,0,3,0]. I can reasonably propose something in between.\n\nLet's consider an offer where Player 2 gets 0 item 1, 1 item 2, 0 item 3, 2 items 4 and 0 items 5 ( [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]) . This means I keep 4 item 1, 1 item 2, 4 item 3, 3 item 4, 2 item 5.\n\nMy value would then be:\n4 * 44 + 1 * 23 + 4 * 24 + 3 * 99 + 2 * 63 = 176 + 23 + 96 + 297 + 126 = 718. This gives a discounted value of 718 * 0.9 = 646.2. This is still lower than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try another offer, lets offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nI would receive 4 item 1, 2 item 2, 4 item 3, 4 item 4, 2 item 5.\n4 * 44 + 2 * 23 + 4 * 24 + 4 * 99 + 2 * 63 = 176 + 46 + 96 + 396 + 126 = 842\nThe discounted value is 842 * 0.9 = 757.8 which is still less than my outside offer of 827, so I should not accept.\n\nLet's consider an offer that gives Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. In this case, I would receive all items.\nMy value would be 4 * 44 + 2 * 23 + 4 * 24 + 5 * 99 + 2 * 63 = 176 + 46 + 96 + 495 + 126 = 939.\nThe discounted value is 939 * 0.9 = 845.1\n\nSince 845.1 > 827, I should make this counteroffer.\n\n**Step 5: Formulate my action.**\n\nI will make a counteroffer to player 2 of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action for Player 1 in round 1.\n\n**Understanding the Game:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Maximize my discounted value from the negotiation, considering my outside offer.\n*   **Items:** 5 item types with different quantities (5, 7, 4, 7, 6) and my private values (62, 66, 32, 46, 39).\n*   **Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 1123, which acts as a minimum value I need to achieve through negotiation.\n*   **Discount Rate:** A discount factor of 0.9 applies each round that the process continues, incentivizing reaching an agreement earlier.\n*   **Rounds:** 3 rounds of negotiation.\n*   **Actions:** Accept, Counteroffer, or Walk.\n\n**Round 1 Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Current Situation:** No offer is on the table yet. I am Player 1 and need to make the first move.\n2.  **My Total Value:** My total value for all items is (5\\*62) + (7\\*66) + (4\\*32) + (7\\*46) + (6\\*39) = 310 + 462 + 128 + 322 + 234 = 1456.\n3.  **Strategy:** I need to make a counteroffer that leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer of 1123, considering the discount factor is 1 in the first round. Since there are no offers to accept yet, I will make a reasonable counteroffer that attempts to secure the majority of the items and thus the value. I need to propose a distribution of items that will give my opponent something, but a value less than my remaining value given my outside offer.\n4.  **Counteroffer Calculation:** I need to propose an offer that keeps more value for myself while also incentivizing Player 2 to accept it. Let's calculate my value when providing 2 units of each item to player 2 and see where that gets me.\n        * 3 units of item 1 = 3*62 = 186\n        * 5 units of item 2 = 5*66 = 330\n        * 2 units of item 3 = 2*32 = 64\n        * 5 units of item 4 = 5*46 = 230\n        * 4 units of item 5 = 4*39 = 156\n    Total Value = 186 + 330 + 64 + 230 + 156 = 966\n    This is not better than my outside offer. So I must be more aggressive.\n    Let me try keeping 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\n    This means offering player 2: 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n    * 3 units of item 1 = 3*62 = 186\n    * 5 units of item 2 = 5*66 = 330\n    * 3 units of item 3 = 3*32 = 96\n    * 5 units of item 4 = 5*46 = 230\n    * 4 units of item 5 = 4*39 = 156\n    Total value: 186+330+96+230+156 = 998\n    This is also not better than my outside offer, so I will try to take even more, making my opening offer to give away 1 unit each of items 1 to 5.\n    So, I would keep 4 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 6 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n    * 4 units of item 1 = 4*62 = 248\n    * 6 units of item 2 = 6*66 = 396\n    * 3 units of item 3 = 3*32 = 96\n    * 6 units of item 4 = 6*46 = 276\n    * 5 units of item 5 = 5*39 = 195\n    Total value = 248+396+96+276+195 = 1211.

So my proposed split to player 1 will be:\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 3\n\n**Counteroffer Calculation:**\nValue of items I'd receive in my proposed counteroffer =\nItem 1: 3 * 11 = 33\nItem 2: 4 * 24 = 96\nItem 3: 2 * 1 = 2\nItem 4: 4 * 91 = 364\nItem 5: 3 * 17 = 51\nTotal Value of my proposed counteroffer = 33 + 96 + 2 + 364 + 51 = 546. This is much better than my outside offer of 160.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 2, 3, 3]}\n```\n",

So my available actions are to walk away or make a counteroffer.\n\n2.  **Value Calculation for my Outside offer**: If I walk away now, I get my outside offer of 166.\n\n3.  **Initial Offer Strategy:** I want to make an offer that will be appealing to Player 2 without giving away too much value. I also need to take into account that I get to make a move in each round, so it might not be necessary to try to win the game in the first round. If a deal is not made in round one, I get to make a move in round two where my effective outside offer value has decreased by gamma to 166 * 0.9 = 149.4, compared to my effective value for a successful negotiation this round which would not be reduced.\n    I will try an initial offer that gives roughly half of each item to Player 2. This is just a starting point and may need to be adjusted later.\n    Let's calculate the value of this offer for me:\n    *   Item 1: I keep 3, value = 3 * 2 = 6\n    *   Item 2: I keep 1.5, value = 1.5 * 15 = 22.5\n    *   Item 3: I keep 3, value = 3 * 79 = 237\n    *   Item 4: I keep 0.5, value = 0.5 * 94 = 47\n    *   Item 5: I keep 1.5, value = 1.5 * 95 = 142.5\n    *   Total value = 6 + 22.5 + 237 + 47 + 142.5 = 455\n    I will round down the amounts I keep to be whole numbers:\n    *   Item 1: I keep 3, value = 3 * 2 = 6\n    *   Item 2: I keep 1, value = 1 * 15 = 15\n    *   Item 3: I keep 3, value = 3 * 79 = 237\n    *   Item 4: I keep 0, value = 0 * 94 = 0\n    *   Item 5: I keep 1, value = 1 * 95 = 95\n    *   Total value = 6 + 15 + 237 + 0 + 95 = 353\n    If I offer to give 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5, to Player 2, then I keep 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 1 units of item 5.

The value of the current offer, 675, is significantly less than our outside offer. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a poor decision for us.\n\n**Counteroffer Strategy:**\n\nSince we are in the first round, we have an opportunity to make a counteroffer.  We need to formulate a counteroffer that would be better than our outside offer after discounting, but also hopefully acceptable to Player 1. Since our outside offer is 1065 and there is no discounting in round 1, we should be seeking a value higher than 1065 in the outcome.\n\nLet us try proposing a counteroffer to Player 1 where we try to keep the items for which we have the highest values (items 1, 2 and 5), and let Player 1 have the majority of the low valued ones (items 3 and 4)\nHere is an example: \nCounteroffer:  Player 1 gets 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This would mean we keep 3 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nOur value: 3*86 + 4*71 + 1*31 + 0*33 + 2*62 = 258 + 284 + 31 + 0 + 124 = 697\nThis is not better than our outside offer of 1065, so we should propose a more favourable offer.\nHow about we give player 1 as few high value items as possible, and keep the rest: offer 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 0 of item 5.\nThis means we keep 4 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 3 of item 5: 4*86 + 6*71 + 2*31 + 0*33 + 3*62 = 344 + 426 + 62 + 0 + 186 = 1018, still not above our outside offer!\n\nHow about we keep everything? \nOffer: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\nValue to us: 4*86 + 6*71 + 4*31 + 1*33 + 3*62 = 344 + 426 + 124 + 33 + 186 = 1113\nThis is greater than 1065, so we should try to propose this!\n\n**Action:**\n\nGiven that the current offer is far below our outside offer, and the proposed counteroffer is better, we will make a counteroffer of 0 for each item.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1152. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 894 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If I WALK, I get 1152 immediately.  I want any deal to be better than that.\n5. **Forming a counteroffer:**\n    * A reasonable starting point would be to offer player 2 half of each item, or as close to half of each item. I will not consider offering more than half of each item to player 2.\n    * That would be to offer player 2 [2, 3, 2, 1, 2], keeping for myself [3, 3, 2, 2, 3] respectively for items 1 through 5.\n    * The value of this offer to me is (3 * 31) + (3 * 79) + (2 * 66) + (2 * 97) + (3 * 25) = 93 + 237 + 132 + 194 + 75 = 731. This is not greater than my outside offer, thus I will offer slightly less to Player 2.\n    * I want to give away the least possible value and see how Player 2 reacts. I will offer player 2 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. This corresponds to an offer of [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], leaving me with [5, 5, 4, 3, 5]. My value is now (5 * 31) + (5 * 79) + (4 * 66) + (3 * 97) + (5 * 25) = 155 + 395 + 264 + 291 + 125 = 1230. This is larger than my outside offer.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven that offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2 yields a value of 1230, which is greater than my outside offer of 1152, I will make this counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**Round 1 Analysis**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means they are offering me 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n*   **My Values:** My private values are 5 for item 1, 78 for item 2, 37 for item 3, 70 for item 4, and 66 for item 5.\n*   **Value of Current Offer:** The value of the current offer to me is (0 * 5) + (1 * 78) + (0 * 37) + (0 * 70) + (0 * 66) = 78.\n*   **My Outside Offer:** My outside offer value is 866.\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor for round 1 is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\n**Decision**\n\nSince the value of the current offer (78) is significantly less than my outside offer (866), I should not accept. I should also consider that if I end up walking away in this round, there will be no discount to apply to my outside offer, so it is advantageous to walk away if my counteroffer is not better than 866.\n\nI should therefore consider making a counteroffer. Let us assume, for now, that it is better for me to propose that I receive all items instead of a deal in which my partner receives a reasonable share of goods and I get an inferior outcome compared to my outside option. To offer my partner all items and leave myself with none implies a value to me of 0. To propose an even split is:\n    2.5 of item 1 = 2.5 * 5 = 12.5\n    3 of item 2 = 3 * 78 = 234\n    2 of item 3 = 2 * 37 = 74\n    1.5 of item 4 = 1.5 * 70 = 105\n    2.5 of item 5 = 2.5 * 66 = 165\nThis gives me a total value of 590.5 which is not greater than my outside offer, so this is also not a suitable strategy for me at this point.\n\nGiven the fact that I will walk if I make a counteroffer in the final round, and because this is only round 1 and I will not receive a discount if I walk now, it is best to make a counteroffer rather than walking away. It is more optimal for me to propose an offer which gives me all goods than it is to walk at this point. Given that there is no limit to how greedy I can be when making a counteroffer, it is optimal for me to offer player 1 none of the goods, giving myself a value of 1181, far exceeding my outside offer of 866.\n\n**Action**\n\nI will make a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This is greater than my outside option of 1152.\n4.  **Consider the Discount:**  If the game goes to the next round, both players' value will be discounted by a factor of gamma, i.e. 0.9.

Let's calculate the value:\n    *   Item 1: 5 * 31 = 155\n    *   Item 2: 6 * 79 = 474\n    *   Item 3: 4 * 66 = 264\n    *   Item 4: 3 * 97 = 291\n    *   Item 5: 5 * 25 = 125\n    *   Total value: 155 + 474 + 264 + 291 + 125 = 1309\n\n2.  **Discounted Value:** The discount factor is gamma = 0.9, and this is round 3 (r=3), so the value of accepting is 1309 * (0.9 ^ (3-1)) =  1309 * 0.81 = 1060.29\n\n3.  **Outside Offer Comparison:** My outside offer value is 1152. The discounted value of accepting the current offer (1060.29) is less than my outside offer.\n\n4.  **Counteroffer:**\n    * Since this is the last round, a counteroffer by player 2 will be treated as a walk. Therefore, I should consider whether I can do better than my outside offer by making a final counteroffer. I don't need to worry about making a counteroffer that player 2 will accept, only whether that counteroffer will produce a better value for me than my outside offer.\n    *   In order to exceed my outside offer of 1152, my proposed counteroffer will need to yield me a value higher than (1152/0.81) = 1422.2. I cannot do this because the maximum possible value I can get from all the items is only 1309.  \n    * I could make a counteroffer where I keep everything and hope that player 2 walks instead of accepting, but since player 2 is also a rational agent they will accept this proposal to avoid taking their outside offer, which would be less valuable to them. Since the other player has shown they are willing to make minimal offers, I can infer their total item value is below mine, so their outside option is less valuable. It would be irrational for them to reject a good offer.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince the value of accepting (1060.29) is less than my outside offer (1152), and making a counteroffer in the last round won't improve the situation I must take my outside offer.\nTherefore, I will WALK away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

I want to make an initial offer that is favorable to me while still giving player 2 something, encouraging them to continue negotiation. I should be careful to avoid being too greedy in this first round, as this would likely lead to them walking away from the negotiation.\n3. **Calculating Total Value** My total value is (5*58) + (9*25) + (3*66) + (1*20) + (6*16) = 290 + 225 + 198 + 20 + 96 = 829.\n4. **Choosing an Initial Offer:** A good strategy here would be to propose a relatively even split, with a slight bias towards myself. I will keep slightly more of the high-value items. Here is the offer I will make to the other player: I will give them 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n5. **Calculating My Value for This Offer** Keeping the rest of the items for myself means that I would have 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 3 of item 5.\nMy value would be (3 * 58) + (4 * 25) + (2 * 66) + (1 * 20) + (3 * 16) = 174 + 100 + 132 + 20 + 48 = 474.\n6. **Comparison to Outside Offer:** My value of 474 with the counteroffer is much greater than my outside offer of 82.

This is less than my outside option value of 82.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n1.  **Accepting:** Accepting the current offer would give me a discounted value of 45, which is worse than my outside option of 82. So, I should not accept.\n\n2.  **Walking Away:** Walking away guarantees me my outside offer of 82.\n\n3.  **Counteroffering:** A counteroffer might be a good option if I can secure an outcome greater than my outside offer of 82. Since this is round 2, I should consider the discount rate. Let's calculate the value of receiving all remaining items, given the current amount Player 2 has (which is 2 for item 2), keeping in mind they offered me items in terms of what they give me, and I offer them in terms of what I give them:\n    * Item 1: 5 - 0 = 5. 5 * 58 = 290\n    * Item 2: 9 - 2 = 7. 7 * 25 = 175\n    * Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3. 3 * 66 = 198\n    * Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1. 1 * 20 = 20\n    * Item 5: 6 - 0 = 6. 6 * 16 = 96\n    Total value for me : 290 + 175 + 198 + 20 + 96 = 779\n    Discounted Value in round 2: 779 * 0.9 = 701.1\nGiven I'm trying to get the max value out of this for myself, given this isn't the last round, I should push for a counteroffer. Given that Player 2's Round 1 offer was so low and that my Round 1 offer was quite large, it seems like they are not very good at negotiating. So I can try to make a counteroffer that isn't as aggressive as my Round 1 offer but still will get me a good deal.\n\nMy current holdings:\nItem 1: 5\nItem 2: 7\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 6\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer:**\n\nI'll counteroffer by offering Player 2: [2, 5, 1, 0, 3]\n\nThis would leave me with:\n*  3 units of item 1: 3 * 58 = 174\n*  2 units of item 2: 2 * 25 = 50\n*  2 units of item 3: 2 * 66 = 132\n*  1 unit of item 4: 1 * 20 = 20\n*  3 units of item 5: 3 * 16 = 48\n\nTotal Value: 174 + 50 + 132 + 20 + 48 = 424\nDiscounted in round 2 : 424 * 0.9 = 381.6\nThis is a good outcome considering that the other player is not a strong negotiator.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI will make the counteroffer [2, 5, 1, 0, 3].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 5, 1, 0, 3]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I could make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal, but there is a risk that in doing so I might end up getting nothing if player 1 walks.

My outside offer is 412.**\n\n**3. Reasoning:**\n\nSince this is the first round, there is no existing offer to accept. I need to determine an initial offer that I believe is likely to be accepted, or at least get the process started. \n\nTo make an informed offer, I should aim for a division that maximizes my value. It is difficult without knowing what Player 2's value is, but I have to make an initial move. \n\nIf I were to offer the other player *nothing* of any items, the value to me is my total value calculated above - 506. This is higher than my outside offer, meaning a deal where I keep everything is my most preferred outcome. However, if my offer is not deemed acceptable it would be rejected and we would go to round 2. Given the discount factor, the value of a deal in round two would be *my_offer_value * 0.9*. This means we can achieve a better deal in round 1 if one is accepted.\n\nGiven I don't know Player 2's values, I will make a concession and offer Player 2 half of all items. \n\n**4. Calculate the value of this offer to me**\n\n* I have 1 unit of item 1, and I'm offering 0.5. I'll get 0.5 * 95 = 47.5\n* I have 3 units of item 2, and I'm offering 1.5. I'll get 1.5 * 19 = 28.5\n* I have 2 units of item 3, and I'm offering 1. I'll get 1 * 5 = 5\n* I have 4 units of item 4, and I'm offering 2. I'll get 2 * 74 = 148\n* I have 8 units of item 5, and I'm offering 4. I'll get 4 * 6 = 24\n* Total value = 47.5+28.5+5+148+24= 253. This is lower than my outside offer value, meaning this would be a bad deal for me.\n\nThis means that my first offer should not be an even split of the items. This means I need to be more strategic.\n\nSince I have a very high value for item 1, and a high value for item 4, and low values for items 2,3, and 5, I will try to give items 2,3, and 5 away to my advantage. I will give half of items 2, 3 and 5 to player 2 in this first offer.\n\n**5. Calculate value of this initial offer**\n    \n    Item 1: 0 given away, 1*95 = 95\n    Item 2: 1.5 given away, 1.5*19 = 28.5\n    Item 3: 1 given away, 1*5=5\n    Item 4: 0 given away, 4*74=296\n    Item 5: 4 given away, 4*6=24\n    Total = 448.5\n\nThis is still higher than the outside offer. However it's less than my total value, and I have not considered whether or not the other agent would be inclined to accept it.\n\nGiven that this is the first offer and I have no information on player 2's values, I'll make a small concession and offer half of Item 5 as well.\n    Item 1: 0 given away, 1*95 = 95\n    Item 2: 1.5 given away, 1.5*19 = 28.5\n    Item 3: 1 given away, 1*5=5\n    Item 4: 0 given away, 4*74=296\n    Item 5: 4 given away, 4*6=24\n    Total = 448.5\n\nThis appears to be the best starting position given that my total value is 506.\n\n**6.

The other player's total value is not known to me.\n\n**Round 1 Strategy:**\n\nIn round 1, I have no offer to accept. I must either walk away or make a counteroffer. My outside offer is 666, so I would like a counteroffer to exceed this. I know that a fair division might be 1/2 the value of all items (or possibly a little more depending on risk aversion). So I would like to make an offer that gives me more than 666 while not giving the other player too much.\nIf I gave the other player half of everything, my value would be approximately half of 1069 (minus half). So let me try giving the other player less than half of everything. For example, if I give the other player 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5, this amounts to:\n(2 * 84) + (1 * 82) + (2 * 40) + (4 * 1) + (2 * 79) = 168 + 82 + 80 + 4 + 158 = 492\nThis is lower than 666 so is not a good choice.\nLet me make an offer that is more advantageous for me. I should keep most of the valuable items and offer more of the low-value items.\n\nLet me offer player 2 the following quantities:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 0 units\nItem 3: 1 unit\nItem 4: 5 units\nItem 5: 0 units\n\nThis would mean I would keep:\nItem 1: 4 units\nItem 2: 2 units\nItem 3: 3 units\nItem 4: 4 units\nItem 5: 4 units\n\nMy value would be:\n(4 * 84) + (2 * 82) + (3 * 40) + (4 * 1) + (4 * 79) = 336 + 164 + 120 + 4 + 316 = 940\n\nThis is above my outside offer of 666 so is a viable offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\nBased on my analysis, I will make a counteroffer in the first round. I will offer the other player 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 5, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n**Understanding the Game:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Maximize my discounted value from the negotiation, compared to my outside offer of 858.\n*   **Items:** 4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n*   **My Values:** 84 for item 1, 74 for item 2, 66 for item 3, 41 for item 4, 89 for item 5.\n*   **Discount:**  Gamma = 0.9, applied to the deal value based on the round it concludes in.\n*   **Rounds:** 3 rounds total.\n*   **Actions:** Accept, Counteroffer, Walk.\n*   **Current Offer:** None\n\n**Strategic Considerations**\n\n*   Since this is round 1, there is no current offer to accept, so my only options are to make a counteroffer or walk away.\n*   If I walk away, I get my outside offer value of 858.\n*   Since the other player's values are unknown to me, I'll need to make a reasonable offer that attempts to get them to engage in the negotiation without giving away too much value.\n*   I will need to consider that the next turn of Player 2 will have a discount factor of 0.9, so it may be best to give them a higher value than what I would expect in the end.\n*   I know my total value of all items is 1222.\n*   I will use my values to evaluate the outcome of any counteroffer I make and compare it to the outside offer.\n\n**Generating a Counteroffer**\n\nAs a starting offer, I will make an offer that is roughly equal value to Player 2.\nSince player 2's values are drawn uniformly randomly between 1 and 101, I will assume their value for each item is about 50. I will give them roughly half the value, so that this offer is attractive to them.\nA simple offer would give player 2 half of each of the items.\nHere's the calculation if we divide the items roughly in half. Since the items are in discrete units, I will need to round appropriately so that both player 1 and player 2 get an integer number of items. I will offer Player 2 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\nThis means I would get 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy value for this is:\n2 * 84 + 2 * 74 + 3 * 66 + 1 * 41 + 1 * 89 = 168 + 148 + 198 + 41 + 89 = 644\n\nSince 644 is less than my outside offer of 858, this isn't very beneficial to me. I need to consider the discount factor.\nIf I make this offer, player 2 will consider accepting it at round 2. My value of 644 will get multiplied by 0.9 if they accept in round 2, so my value will be 579.6. If I walk away, I get 858. So it will not make sense to offer something if it will be accepted at round 2.\nIf Player 2 accepts in round 1, I get 644 * 1 = 644. Again, this is much lower than my walkaway value.\n\nSince my items are valued higher than a rough average, I should make a counteroffer that is more beneficial to me than a straight half, since I don't care if Player 2 gets a higher value, as long as my value is high. \nI need to give away fewer of the items that I value highly. \n\nI will offer player 2:\n1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\nThis means I will get:\n3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\nMy value for this would be:\n3 * 84 + 3 * 74 + 3 * 66 + 1 * 41 + 1 * 89 = 252 + 222 + 198 + 41 + 89 = 802\nAgain, this is less than my outside value, but Player 2 would likely get a higher total value than me. Since my goal is to maximize my value, I need to keep more of what I value highly.\n\nI will try another offer:\nPlayer 2 gets: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\nThis means I get: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\nMy value = 3 * 84 + 3 * 74 + 4 * 66 + 2 * 41 + 2 * 89 = 252 + 222 + 264 + 82 + 178 = 998.\nThis is higher than my outside value and is worth pursuing, if the other player is likely to accept it. I will assume they are rational.\n\nTherefore, this will be my counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1 in round 1.\n\n**Understanding the Game:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Maximize our total value, considering item values, discount factor, and the outside offer.\n*   **Rounds:** 3 rounds of negotiation with a discount factor of 0.9 per round.\n*   **Items:** 5 types of items with varying quantities (0, 5, 4, 5, 5).\n*   **Private Values:** Our values per item are 72, 56, 31, 50, and 60 for items 1 through 5, respectively.\n*   **Outside Offer:** Our outside offer is 315.\n*   **Current Offer:** No current offer.\n*   **Initial Action:** Must either WALK or propose a COUNTEROFFER.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nSince we're in round 1 and there's no existing offer, we need to make an initial offer that is both appealing to us and might be acceptable to player 2 (though we don't know their values). We want to avoid walking away. We'll aim for an offer that is better for us than our outside offer, while keeping in mind that we will discount the value by 0.9^(round-1) = 0.9^0=1 for this round.  In later rounds, that discount will become relevant.\n\nLet's consider some potential counteroffers:\n\n**Scenario 1:  Keep most of the high-value items**\nIf we are really selfish we could offer 0 for everything and that would give us a value of (0 * 72) + (5 * 56) + (4 * 31) + (5 * 50) + (5 * 60) = 0 + 280 + 124 + 250 + 300 = 954\nWe should keep at least one of the lower value items for ourselves, though, in order to give Player 2 something of value and increase the chance that they accept. We will try to get as much of the higher value items as possible, though.\n\n**Scenario 2: Giving some of each item to Player 2.**\nTo have a better chance of negotiation and not make the other player immediately walk away, I will offer a reasonable number of items to them. This requires some assumptions, though, as we don't know their values or the best offer for both of us. I will start by offering Player 2 2 units of each item that we have available. This will be easy for me to calculate, and give the other player enough of each item for it to be potentially enticing.\n\n*   Item 1: Give 0 units to player 2, Keep 0. Value = 0\n*   Item 2: Give 2 units to player 2, Keep 3. Value = 3 * 56 = 168\n*   Item 3: Give 2 units to player 2, Keep 2. Value = 2 * 31 = 62\n*   Item 4: Give 2 units to player 2, Keep 3. Value = 3 * 50 = 150\n*   Item 5: Give 2 units to player 2, Keep 3. Value = 3 * 60 = 180\nTotal value of this offer = 168 + 62 + 150 + 180 = 560\nThis value is much better than my outside offer of 315, so it is a good starting point.\n\n**Action:**\n\nBased on the above analysis, I will make the second counteroffer of giving the other player 2 units of items 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

Given that we are in round 2, the discount rate is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. The discounted value of this deal is then 197 * 0.9 = 177.3.\n\nSince 177.3 is much lower than my outside offer value of 315, I should not accept this offer.\n\n**Optimal Action Calculation:**\n\nWe need to consider whether to walk away, or to make a counteroffer. It is round two, so if I make a counteroffer, I have another round to potentially gain from negotiations. \n\nLet us assume we give the other player 0 of each item that they would receive in the current offer (1 of each item), this would be equivalent to a counteroffer: [0, 4, 3, 4, 4]. We can compute the value to us of that as follows:\n\n*   Item 1: 0 * 72 = 0\n*   Item 2: 4 * 56 = 224\n*   Item 3: 3 * 31 = 93\n*   Item 4: 4 * 50 = 200\n*   Item 5: 4 * 60 = 240\n*   Total: 0 + 224 + 93 + 200 + 240 = 757\n\nEven accounting for the discount factor it is worth it to offer less. So it is likely that a counteroffer would result in a better expected value. I will try to get as much as possible by offering them very little. I will give them 1 of each item. That would require the counteroffer [0, 4, 3, 4, 4]. Let's recompute the total value with that:\n*   Item 1: 0 * 72 = 0\n*   Item 2: 4 * 56 = 224\n*   Item 3: 3 * 31 = 93\n*   Item 4: 4 * 50 = 200\n*   Item 5: 4 * 60 = 240\n*   Total: 0 + 224 + 93 + 200 + 240 = 757\n\nThis is still way better than my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\nBased on this analysis, I should make a counteroffer since my outside offer is not better than the value I can obtain from making a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 3, 4, 4]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, I want a deal that's worth at least 537 to me.\n\n3. **First Move Strategy:** Since this is round 1, I will start with a reasonable offer that gives me a good share of the total value but leaves some room for the other player to also benefit. The optimal strategy often involves offering the other player less than what they value but enough to make a deal better than their outside option. We don't know their valuations, but we can try to get the best value for ourselves while trying to make a deal. If the other player values these at least as much as me, they will be able to make a deal.\n\n4.  **Making an Offer:** I am going to propose the following division:\n    *   Give Player 2: 1 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 1 of item 5.\n    *   Keep for myself: 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 1 of item 5\n    \n    My value of this offer is:\n    *  item 1 : 1 * 67 = 67\n    *  item 2 : 1 * 72 = 72\n    *  item 3 : 2 * 90 = 180\n    *  item 4 : 1 * 36 = 36\n    * item 5 : 1 * 60 = 60\n    Total value of this offer is 415 + 180 = 415, which is less than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try the following:\n    Give Player 2: 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 0 of item 5\n    Keep for myself: 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 2 of item 5\n    \n    My value of this offer is:\n    *  item 1 : 2 * 67 = 134\n    *  item 2 : 1 * 72 = 72\n    *  item 3 : 3 * 90 = 270\n    *  item 4 : 2 * 36 = 72\n    * item 5 : 2 * 60 = 120\n    Total value of this offer is 668 which is greater than my outside offer.\n    \n    This looks like a good initial offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

To make an offer that could potentially be accepted it should leave the other player with a positive offer as well.\n\n**Generating a Counteroffer**\n\nSince we do not have any information about the other player's valuation we will simply divide items evenly.

Therefore, it is beneficial for me to accept the current offer if I think Player 2 will not make a better offer next round.\n\nHowever, we are in round 2, and player 2 may make an offer. We can either accept, or make a counteroffer that might be accepted or could leave us better off compared to our outside option. However, if player 2 rejects our offer and the game ends in round 3 they get their outside offer and we get ours multiplied by the discount factor squared.\n\nLet's first calculate the value of what we keep from our previous offer and compare it to the discounted value of current offer.\nMy previous offer was to give player 2: [2, 3, 2, 3, 2].\nThis means we keep [2, 3, 3, 3, 2] if they accept.\nValue of keeping [2, 3, 3, 3, 2]:\n2 * 82 = 164\n3 * 84 = 252\n3 * 90 = 270\n3 * 7 = 21\n2 * 26 = 52\nTotal = 759\n759 * 0.9 = 683.1\n\nThis is better than accepting the current offer and gives us an idea of what is possible. We should try and get as close to this as possible.\n\nLet's consider making a counter offer, offering slightly less to the other player to try to increase our value.\nA counter offer of [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] to player 2 would mean we would get:\n[3, 4, 4, 4, 3]\n3 * 82 = 246\n4 * 84 = 336\n4 * 90 = 360\n4 * 7 = 28\n3 * 26 = 78\nTotal value = 1048\n1048 * 0.9 = 943.2\n\nSince we have a good offer on the table, it would make sense to make our counter offer less valuable than this to make them more likely to accept and not force us to go to our outside offer.\n\nSince we have more than double our outside offer at stake, I propose we propose an offer such that our value would still be greater than our outside offer, but would give them a large amount.\n\nLet's propose [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], which means we get [3, 4, 4, 4, 3].\nValue of [3, 4, 4, 4, 3]:\n3*82 = 246\n4*84 = 336\n4*90 = 360\n4*7 = 28\n3*26 = 78\nTotal: 1048\n1048 * 0.9 = 943.2, significantly above our outside offer.\nHowever, if this is not accepted we may end up with a discount applied to our outside offer.\n\nA very safe option would be to accept the current offer. Since it is the second to last round, accepting a guaranteed return greater than your outside offer with no further discounts is a logical choice, especially given the small margin, it is not worth the risk of a walk.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBased on the analysis, accepting the current offer is the safest and most logical approach given the current situation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

I need to decide if making an offer is more beneficial than my outside option.\n\nMy total value of all items is:\n\n(8 * 36) + (7 * 82) + (5 * 2) + (3 * 88) + (4 * 73) = 288 + 574 + 10 + 264 + 292 = 1428.\n\nMy outside offer value is 1333.\nI can't simply propose splitting the items exactly in half or in other similar ways since that may not provide me with a value over my outside offer. I need to formulate a reasonable offer which gives the other player a sufficient amount but at the same time keeps my own value over the outside offer.\n\n**Calculating the value of a potential offer**\n\nLet's make an initial counteroffer giving player 2 a relatively large portion of each item and calculate it's value to me:\n\nOffer to Player 2:\n* Item 1: 4\n* Item 2: 3\n* Item 3: 2\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 2\n\nThis would leave me with:\n* Item 1: 4\n* Item 2: 4\n* Item 3: 3\n* Item 4: 2\n* Item 5: 2\n\nMy value from this offer:\n(4 * 36) + (4 * 82) + (3 * 2) + (2 * 88) + (2 * 73) = 144 + 328 + 6 + 176 + 146 = 800\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 1333, so I would not consider making this offer in round one.\n\nLet's make an offer giving player 2 a smaller portion:\nOffer to Player 2:\n* Item 1: 2\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 1\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 1\n\nThis would leave me with:\n* Item 1: 6\n* Item 2: 6\n* Item 3: 4\n* Item 4: 3\n* Item 5: 3\n\nMy value from this offer:\n(6 * 36) + (6 * 82) + (4 * 2) + (3 * 88) + (3 * 73) = 216 + 492 + 8 + 264 + 219 = 1199\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 1333. \nLet's try and find a better offer. Given my values, I want to keep most of item 2 and 4 for myself and give more of items 1 and 5 to player 2 since they are less valuable to me. I also dont want to give away any item 3 since this is very low value to me.\nLet's make the following offer to player 2:\nOffer to Player 2:\n* Item 1: 3\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 2\n\nThis would leave me with:\n* Item 1: 5\n* Item 2: 7\n* Item 3: 5\n* Item 4: 3\n* Item 5: 2\n\nMy value from this offer:\n(5 * 36) + (7 * 82) + (5 * 2) + (3 * 88) + (2 * 73) = 180 + 574 + 10 + 264 + 146 = 1174\n\nThis is still less than the outside offer. I think it is worth testing the waters with a better offer, though I know that if it is rejected it might give away information about my valuations, I should expect to get something better than my outside offer though.\n\nLet's try one more time. If I offer player 2 only items 1 and 5, I should be able to keep the more valuable items for myself.\n\nOffer to Player 2:\n* Item 1: 2\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 1\n\nThis would leave me with:\n* Item 1: 6\n* Item 2: 7\n* Item 3: 5\n* Item 4: 3\n* Item 5: 3\n\nMy value from this offer:\n(6 * 36) + (7 * 82) + (5 * 2) + (3 * 88) + (3 * 73) = 216 + 574 + 10 + 264 + 219 = 1283\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 1333. Given how difficult it is to formulate an offer greater than my outside option, it makes more sense to walk away in round one.\n\n**Decision**\n\nSince I cannot make an offer that provides me with a value above my outside offer of 1333, I will walk away and take my guaranteed value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

I'm in the first round, so I should make a generous offer that doesn't risk getting rejected too early, but that nets me a higher value than walking.\n*   I'll calculate the total value of all items to myself to help determine what to offer.\n    * Item 1: 3 * 34 = 102\n    * Item 2: 7 * 85 = 595\n    * Item 3: 5 * 44 = 220\n    * Item 4: 3 * 85 = 255\n    * Item 5: 1 * 81 = 81\n    * Total: 102 + 595 + 220 + 255 + 81 = 1253\n    * My Outside Offer: 1033\n*   To make a safe first offer, I will try to get at least half of the total value and give the other player the other half. This approach may be too conservative but it gives me a safe starting point that is worth more than my outside offer value. \n*   Let's propose giving Player 2 half of each item (rounded up or down), if applicable and keep the rest for myself:\n    * Player 2 receives: 2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 1 of item 5\n    * I receive: 1 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5\n    * My value would be:\n    * 1 * 34 + 3 * 85 + 2 * 44 + 1 * 85 + 0 * 81 = 34 + 255 + 88 + 85 + 0 = 462\n    * This value 462 is lower than my outside offer of 1033, so I will adjust my offer.\n* Let's propose giving Player 2 1 unit each of all item types available and the remaining items to myself. This is because player 2 gets the most value out of items 1, 3, and 5.\n    * Player 2 receives: 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n    * I receive: 2 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n    * My value would be:\n        * 2 * 34 + 6 * 85 + 4 * 44 + 2 * 85 + 0 * 81 = 68 + 510 + 176 + 170 + 0 = 924\n    * This value 924 is lower than my outside offer of 1033.\n*   Let's propose giving Player 2 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n    * Player 2 receives: 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n    * I receive: 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n    * My value would be:\n    * 3 * 34 + 5 * 85 + 4 * 44 + 3 * 85 + 1 * 81 = 102 + 425 + 176 + 255 + 81 = 1039\n    * This value 1039 is greater than my outside offer of 1033.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze this negotiation problem step-by-step.\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\n*   **My Values:** I value item 1 at 20, item 2 at 79, item 3 at 45, item 4 at 46, and item 5 at 31.\n*   **My Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 1039.\n*   **Item Quantities:** There are 6 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 6 of item 5.\n*   **Discount Rate:** The discount rate is 0.9 per round.\n*   **Goal:** Maximize my discounted total value, which includes the value of the items received through negotiation multiplied by the discount rate, or receive my outside offer if no agreement is reached.\n*   **Round 1:** This is the first round, and there is no existing offer. Thus, I must make an offer.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nSince this is the first round, I want to make a counteroffer that is attractive to player 2 but still gives me the best value above my outside offer. As my goal is to maximize my value, I need to get above my outside option as well as leave room for player 2 to also receive some value, otherwise they may walk away.\n\nA key principle here is that I value item 2 highly (79), but the player is likely to not value it highly as there are 5 units. In contrast, I value items 1 and 5 poorly compared to 2 and 3. As such, I should make a counteroffer where I take more of items 2 and 3 while giving player 2 more of items 1, 4, and 5.\n\nLet's consider a possible initial offer. I'll offer the other player: \n* 4 units of item 1 (I keep 2)\n* 2 units of item 2 (I keep 3)\n* 2 units of item 3 (I keep 3)\n* 3 units of item 4 (I keep 2)\n* 4 units of item 5 (I keep 2)\n\nLet's calculate my value for this offer:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units * 20 = 40\n*   Item 2: 3 units * 79 = 237\n*   Item 3: 3 units * 45 = 135\n*   Item 4: 2 units * 46 = 92\n*   Item 5: 2 units * 31 = 62\n*   Total Value = 40 + 237 + 135 + 92 + 62 = 566\n\nThis offer has a value less than my outside option of 1039. Therefore, I need to make an offer where I keep more of the valuable items for myself. Let's consider offering:\n\n* 2 units of item 1 (I keep 4)\n* 1 unit of item 2 (I keep 4)\n* 1 unit of item 3 (I keep 4)\n* 2 units of item 4 (I keep 3)\n* 2 units of item 5 (I keep 4)\n\nLet's calculate my value for this offer:\n\n* Item 1: 4 * 20 = 80\n* Item 2: 4 * 79 = 316\n* Item 3: 4 * 45 = 180\n* Item 4: 3 * 46 = 138\n* Item 5: 4 * 31 = 124\n* Total Value = 80 + 316 + 180 + 138 + 124 = 838\n\nThis is still below my outside option. Let's consider an offer that keeps a majority of items 2 and 3 while giving away more of items 1, 4, and 5.\n\nLet's offer:\n\n* 4 units of item 1 (I keep 2)\n* 1 unit of item 2 (I keep 4)\n* 1 unit of item 3 (I keep 4)\n* 3 units of item 4 (I keep 2)\n* 4 units of item 5 (I keep 2)\n\nLet's calculate my value:\n\n* Item 1: 2 * 20 = 40\n* Item 2: 4 * 79 = 316\n* Item 3: 4 * 45 = 180\n* Item 4: 2 * 46 = 92\n* Item 5: 2 * 31 = 62\n* Total Value = 40 + 316 + 180 + 92 + 62 = 690\n\nThis is still less than my outside option, but close. Let's try an offer that keeps all of item 2:\n\n* 4 units of item 1 (I keep 2)\n* 0 units of item 2 (I keep 5)\n* 1 units of item 3 (I keep 4)\n* 3 units of item 4 (I keep 2)\n* 4 units of item 5 (I keep 2)\n\nValue:\n* Item 1: 2 * 20 = 40\n* Item 2: 5 * 79 = 395\n* Item 3: 4 * 45 = 180\n* Item 4: 2 * 46 = 92\n* Item 5: 2 * 31 = 62\n* Total: 769\n\nThis is still below 1039. How about:\n\n*   5 of item 1 (I keep 1)\n*   0 of item 2 (I keep 5)\n*   2 of item 3 (I keep 3)\n*   3 of item 4 (I keep 2)\n*   5 of item 5 (I keep 1)\n\nValue:\n*   Item 1: 1 * 20 = 20\n*   Item 2: 5 * 79 = 395\n*   Item 3: 3 * 45 = 135\n*   Item 4: 2 * 46 = 92\n*   Item 5: 1 * 31 = 31\n*  Total: 673\n\nIt is clear I need to take more of item 2. I am going to make an offer where I take all of item 2.\n\n*   4 of item 1 (I keep 2)\n*   0 of item 2 (I keep 5)\n*   3 of item 3 (I keep 2)\n*   3 of item 4 (I keep 2)\n*   4 of item 5 (I keep 2)\n\nValue:\n* Item 1: 2 * 20 = 40\n* Item 2: 5 * 79 = 395\n* Item 3: 2 * 45 = 90\n* Item 4: 2 * 46 = 92\n* Item 5: 2 * 31 = 62\n* Total: 679\n\nOkay, I'm going to take all of item 2, keep 3 of item 3 and give away the rest while keeping 2 of the remaining items.\n\n*   4 of item 1\n*   0 of item 2\n*   2 of item 3\n*   3 of item 4\n*  4 of item 5\n\nValue:\n* Item 1: 2 * 20 = 40\n* Item 2: 5 * 79 = 395\n* Item 3: 3 * 45 = 135\n* Item 4: 2 * 46 = 92\n* Item 5: 2 * 31 = 62\n* Total = 724\n\nGiven that an aggressive offer that takes most of items 2 and 3 still results in a value less than my outside option, it would be best to start with a generous offer that maximizes my potential value. Let's offer:\n\n* 2 units of item 1 (I keep 4)\n* 0 units of item 2 (I keep 5)\n* 1 unit of item 3 (I keep 4)\n* 2 units of item 4 (I keep 3)\n* 2 units of item 5 (I keep 4)\n\nValue:\n* Item 1: 4 * 20 = 80\n* Item 2: 5 * 79 = 395\n* Item 3: 4 * 45 = 180\n* Item 4: 3 * 46 = 138\n* Item 5: 4 * 31 = 124\n* Total = 917\n\nLet's make an offer that captures almost all of my value items and try to extract as much as possible given the fact that it is round 1 and thus have more negotiating power. I will keep all of items 2 and 3.\n\n*   5 units of item 1\n*   0 units of item 2\n*   0 units of item 3\n*  4 units of item 4\n*   5 units of item 5\n\nValue:\n* Item 1: 1 * 20 = 20\n* Item 2: 5 * 79 = 395\n* Item 3: 5 * 45 = 225\n* Item 4: 1 * 46 = 46\n* Item 5: 1 * 31 = 31\n* Total = 717\n\nLet's try again.\n\n*   4 units of item 1\n*   0 units of item 2\n*   0 units of item 3\n*  3 units of item 4\n*   4 units of item 5\n\nValue:\n* Item 1: 2 * 20 = 40\n* Item 2: 5 * 79 = 395\n* Item 3: 5 * 45 = 225\n* Item 4: 2 * 46 = 92\n* Item 5: 2 * 31 = 62\n* Total = 814\n\nI am still below my outside offer. Given that my values for items 2 and 3 are so high, I will keep all of items 2 and 3 and make a reasonable offer for the rest.\n\n*   4 units of item 1\n*   0 units of item 2\n*   0 units of item 3\n*   3 units of item 4\n*   4 units of item 5\n\nValue:\n\n*  Item 1: 2 * 20 = 40\n*  Item 2: 5 * 79 = 395\n*  Item 3: 5 * 45 = 225\n*  Item 4: 2 * 46 = 92\n*  Item 5: 2 * 31 = 62\nTotal = 814.\n\nStill not high enough. It seems that I am unable to reach a deal better than my outside option. As such, I will take my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

Since there are no offers currently, and it's the first round I need to make a proposal that is more than my outside offer, but gives enough value to player 2 that they have an incentive to accept it.\n\nI could attempt to get player 2 to accept a minimal offer this round, giving them just enough that they will be better off than their outside offer. However, without knowing their private values, this would be difficult to calculate. \n\nA simple but logical approach is to offer each player half the items. I cannot offer exactly half on item 2, so I will offer 2 of item 2 to player 2, keeping 3 for myself. I will also offer player 2 1 unit of item 1, and 1 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5.

Therefore, accepting this offer is not a good option.\n\n4.  **Counteroffer Strategy:**\n    *   I want to try to obtain more value than my outside offer. Given the current offer and the game dynamics, the most aggressive counter offer would be to take the largest portion of the resources.\n    *   My total number of items are 2, 5, 3, 2, 2. So to keep most of this for myself, I will offer 0 units of each item to player 1. This would be the maximum value I could obtain and would be considered a reasonable counteroffer, given player 1 is offering me very little.\n    *   My calculation for the counteroffer to keep the total for myself is:\n        *   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 63 = 126\n        *   5 units of item 2 = 5 * 71 = 355\n        *   3 units of item 3 = 3 * 73 = 219\n        *   2 units of item 4 = 2 * 87 = 174\n        *   2 units of item 5 = 2 * 69 = 138\n        *   Total Value: 1012\n\n**Decision:**\nSince the value of the current offer (434) is much lower than my outside offer (797), I will make a counteroffer that is the most aggressive counteroffer which would obtain the most value.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 has offered me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. My private values are 63 for item 1, 71 for item 2, 73 for item 3, 87 for item 4, and 69 for item 5. My outside offer is 797. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n*   Item 1: I receive 1 unit, so I keep 2-1=1 unit * 63 = 63\n*   Item 2: I receive 1 unit, so I keep 5-1=4 units * 71 = 284\n*   Item 3: I receive 1 unit, so I keep 3-1=2 units * 73 = 146\n*   Item 4: I receive 1 unit, so I keep 2-1=1 unit * 87 = 87\n*   Item 5: I receive 1 unit, so I keep 2-1=1 unit * 69 = 69\nTotal value to me of accepting the current offer = 63 + 284 + 146 + 87 + 69 = 649\n\nNow, I need to adjust for the discount factor since we are on round 2.  The value is 649 * 0.9^(2-1) = 649 * 0.9 = 584.1.\nMy outside offer is 797.  Since 584.1 < 797, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nI need to consider making a counter offer. To make a useful counteroffer, I need to at least get more value than my outside offer, considering the round discount factor.  The maximum value I could achieve is if I receive all items and that would be the total value of 1012 (63*2 + 71*5 + 73*3 + 87*2 + 69*2). My outside value, adjusting for round, is 797. My value must be greater than 797/0.9 = 885.56. So, if I was to make a counteroffer, I would need a value above that, so I need to try to get close to the 1012 value. \n\nConsidering the history, my first offer was [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and player 1's first offer was [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]. Their second offer was [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. It looks like I will need to be more aggressive, so I am going to offer them [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This offer keeps most items for me. \nValue Calculation:\n* Item 1: I keep 2 units * 63 = 126\n* Item 2: I keep 4 units * 71 = 284\n* Item 3: I keep 3 units * 73 = 219\n* Item 4: I keep 2 units * 87 = 174\n* Item 5: I keep 2 units * 69 = 138\nTotal Value to me: 126 + 284 + 219 + 174 + 138 = 941\nAdjusted Value = 941 * 0.9^(2-1) = 941 * 0.9 = 846.9\n\nThis is now a more aggressive counteroffer which is greater than my outside offer, adjusted by round 2 discount factor, which is 797 / .9 = 885.56, and it is also greater than the value to me if I accepted the current offer, 584.1. So, this should be a good offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the optimal action for Player 1 in round 1.\n\n**Understanding the Game**\n\n*   **Goal:** Maximize our discounted value, considering our outside offer (864).\n*   **Items:** 5 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 1 of item 5.\n*   **Our Values:** 48 (item 1), 26 (item 2), 47 (item 3), 73 (item 4), 66 (item 5).\n*   **Outside Offer:** 864\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9\n\n**Round 1 Strategy**\n\nSince we are the first player, we have the power to make the initial offer. Our aim is to propose an offer that gives us a total value greater than our outside offer of 864 while also being reasonable enough for Player 2 to consider.\n\n**Calculating the Total Item Value**\nOur total value from all items, if we kept them all, would be:\n(5 * 48) + (4 * 26) + (4 * 47) + (5 * 73) + (1 * 66) = 240 + 104 + 188 + 365 + 66 = 963\n\n**Making a Fair Initial Offer**\n\nWe need to find a split that is good for us, but also attractive to the other player so they might accept it. A simple way to approach this is to start by offering an equal split, calculating value, then adjusting the offer for a good balance. Since the items are not all available in the same quantity and our values per item are not equal, a literal 50/50 split is not going to make sense. Let's try to find a split that gets us close to half the total value, then offer them slightly less than that.\n\nIf we offer half of all items to the other player, this would be:\n2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 0 of item 5 for Player 2.\nThis leaves us:\n3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\n\nOur value from this would be: (3 * 48) + (2 * 26) + (2 * 47) + (3 * 73) + (1 * 66) = 144 + 52 + 94 + 219 + 66 = 575. This is significantly less than our outside offer, so we need to keep more.\n\nIf we offer 1 of each item to the other player (since we only have 1 of item 5, we can't do more):\n1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 1 of item 5.\nThis leaves us:\n4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4 and 0 of item 5.\nOur value from this would be: (4 * 48) + (3 * 26) + (3 * 47) + (4 * 73) + (0 * 66) = 192 + 78 + 141 + 292 + 0= 703.\nStill not high enough compared to our outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering them 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 0 of item 5. This gives us:\n4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\nOur value from this would be (4 * 48) + (3 * 26) + (3 * 47) + (3 * 73) + (1 * 66) = 192 + 78 + 141 + 219 + 66 = 696. This is still not quite high enough, but closer.\n\nLet's try offering them 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 0 of item 5.

Still below the outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 0 of item 5. This gives us:\n5 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\nOur value from this is (5 * 48) + (3 * 26) + (3 * 47) + (4 * 73) + (1 * 66) = 240 + 78 + 141 + 292 + 66 = 817. This is not higher than our outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 0 of item 5.

Item 1: 1 unit * 48 = 48\n2.  Item 2: 1 unit * 26 = 26\n3.  Item 3: 1 unit * 47 = 47\n4.  Item 4: 1 unit * 73 = 73\n5.  Item 5: 0 unit * 66 = 0\n    \n    Total value of current offer = 48 + 26 + 47 + 73 = 194\n\n**Discounted Value of Current Offer:**\n\nThe discount factor is gamma = 0.9. Since it is round 2, the discounted value is calculated as:\nValue * (gamma ^ (round -1)) = 194 * (0.9 ^ (2-1)) = 194 * 0.9 = 174.6\n\n**Comparing with Outside Offer:**\n\nMy outside offer is 864, while the discounted value of the current offer is 174.6. \n\nThe discounted value is less than my outside offer. Therefore, it is not beneficial to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n**Consider Counteroffer:**\n\nTo decide on a counteroffer, I should consider whether there is an offer I could propose that I would prefer over my outside offer while still being palatable for player 2, so that they don't walk in the next round.\n\nBefore deciding, we must consider that any offer proposed at round 2, will result in discounted values to each player. So if the other player accepts in round 2, both players have their valuation discounted by gamma.\n\nLet's try to calculate my value if I keep all items for myself and offer nothing to player 2.\nMy value for all items:\n5 * 48 + 4 * 26 + 4 * 47 + 5 * 73 + 1 * 66 = 240 + 104 + 188 + 365 + 66 = 963\nMy discounted value: 963 * 0.9 = 866.7\n\nSince this value is higher than my outside option, it's clearly beneficial for me to make a proposal closer to this than the current offer. In the round 1, I offered [0,1,1,0,0]. The other player offered [1,1,1,1,0].\nLets try an offer close to where I take most of the value, and offer the same amounts they offered in the first round. \n\nI will make the counteroffer [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]. If I retain everything else, it would be:\nItem 1: 4 units * 48 = 192\nItem 2: 3 units * 26 = 78\nItem 3: 3 units * 47 = 141\nItem 4: 4 units * 73 = 292\nItem 5: 1 unit * 66 = 66\nTotal value of items retained: 192 + 78 + 141 + 292 + 66 = 769\nDiscounted value of 769 * 0.9 = 692.1 which is still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try the next best offer to keep most of the value for me and let player 2 have as little as possible. I will make the counteroffer [0,0,0,0,0].\nValue of items to me: 5 * 48 + 4 * 26 + 4 * 47 + 5 * 73 + 1 * 66 = 963\nDiscounted value: 963 * 0.9 = 866.7, which is larger than my outside offer of 864. This proposal would secure the best possible position for me so let's offer it.\n\n**Action:**\n\nI will propose the counter offer that I take everything.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

We are in round 1, so I will make a counteroffer.\n\n**Optimal Counteroffer Strategy:**\nI want to maximize the value of my offer, taking the discount factor into account. Since it's round 1, I should aim for a fair offer, that is at least as good as my outside offer. I will need to counteroffer with at least enough to be worth more than 849.

I have:\n* 3 units of item 1, value 183\n* 4 units of item 2, value 68\n* 4 units of item 3, value 304\n* 9 units of item 4, value 207\n* 6 units of item 5, value 498\nThis gives a total value of 1260.\nIf I offer Player 1 0 of each item, then I would get 1260. This is clearly too greedy and they will walk.\nI need to take a more reasonable approach. I will offer them an amount of the items that leaves me with just over 849, such that they are incentivized to accept. It is also important to maximize value for myself in the initial round so I do not have to take the discount factor into account too much. I will start by offering 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3.

This is below my outside offer.\nLet's try keep more.\n* Offer 1: 1, Offer 2: 1, Offer 3: 1, Offer 4: 3, Offer 5: 2\nFor me that means:\n* Keep Item 1: 2, value 122\n* Keep Item 2: 3, value 51\n* Keep Item 3: 3, value 228\n* Keep Item 4: 6, value 138\n* Keep Item 5: 4, value 332\nTotal = 871. This is better than my outside offer. So, I will offer: [1, 1, 1, 3, 2] to player 1.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]}\n```\n",

Compare to outside offer:**\n\nPlayer 1's outside offer is 701. The discounted value of accepting the current offer (966.6) is significantly higher than the outside offer.\n\n**3. Consider making a counteroffer:**\nGiven the current offer is significantly better than the walk-away, a counter-offer might be unnecessary. We could potentially get more value by taking the deal, rather than walking away. However, we are not guaranteed that Player 2 will accept. If they do not accept, we would need to consider the next offer discounted by a factor of 0.9^2.\n\n**4.

Thus, accepting the current offer is not a beneficial option for me.\n\n**Considering a Counteroffer**\n\nSince accepting is not an option, I will consider making a counteroffer. I need to propose an offer that has better value to me and may be acceptable to the other player. I'll start by considering an offer where I get close to all the items (leaving the other player with little). This would have maximum value to me.\n* I will calculate the total value to me if I were to keep all the items, and give player 2 [0,0,0,0,0]. This would mean I get the remaining items [3,4,5,7,3]\n*   Item 1: 3 * 42 = 126\n*   Item 2: 4 * 92 = 368\n*   Item 3: 5 * 36 = 180\n*   Item 4: 7 * 30 = 210\n*   Item 5: 3 * 21 = 63\n*   Total value = 126 + 368 + 180 + 210 + 63 = 947.\n*   Discounted value = 947 * 0.9 = 852.3\n\nSince this is round 2 and the other player offered me [0,1,1,2,1] in round 1 (a low value offer for me, so they're expecting me to make a counter offer), I'll try making a counteroffer that leaves me with a value higher than my outside offer while leaving the other player with some items.\n\nI'll make a counteroffer where the other player gets [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\nThis means I would get [2,3,4,6,2]\nValue of offer to me:\n*   Item 1: 2 * 42 = 84\n*   Item 2: 3 * 92 = 276\n*   Item 3: 4 * 36 = 144\n*   Item 4: 6 * 30 = 180\n*   Item 5: 2 * 21 = 42\n* Total value: 84+276+144+180+42=726\n* Discounted value = 726*0.9 = 653.4\n\nSince 653.4 is greater than my outside offer of 535, this is an acceptable counteroffer. I'll offer this in this round.\n\n**Action**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 282. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 837 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n**My Values:**\n* Item 1: 69\n* Item 2: 24\n* Item 3: 3\n* Item 4: 96\n* Item 5: 87\n\n**My Outside Offer:** 282\n\n**Current Offer (to me):** [3, 2, 2, 1, 0]\nThis means Player 2 is offering me:\n* 3 units of item 1\n* 2 units of item 2\n* 2 units of item 3\n* 1 unit of item 4\n* 0 units of item 5\n\n**Calculating the value of the current offer to me:**\n* Item 1: 3 * 69 = 207\n* Item 2: 2 * 24 = 48\n* Item 3: 2 * 3 = 6\n* Item 4: 1 * 96 = 96\n* Item 5: 0 * 87 = 0\n* Total value of current offer: 207 + 48 + 6 + 96 + 0 = 357\n\n**Discount Factor:** Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**Discounted Value of Current Offer:** 357 * 0.9 = 321.3\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe discounted value of the current offer (321.3) is greater than my outside offer (282). This means accepting the offer is better than walking away right now. Therefore I will accept the offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",
