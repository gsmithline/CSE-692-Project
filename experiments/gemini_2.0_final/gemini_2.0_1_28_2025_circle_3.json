                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 382. This is my guaranteed fallback value if negotiations fail.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 43 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 15 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 78 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 11 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 47 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   2 units of item 1\n    *   4 units of item 2\n    *   5 units of item 3\n    *   7 units of item 4\n    *   7 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 (0.9 * 0.9) the value of the deal in round 1. Since it is round 1 currently, the discount factor has no effect on immediate values, however it will effect later rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since it is round 1, I need to make an initial offer. My goal is to maximize my value while also making an offer that Player 2 will find at least somewhat acceptable, to avoid walking away. I know that my total value of all the items is 942. I will attempt to get slightly more than half of the total value to start. Therefore I need to offer slightly less than half of the total value to player 2.\n        Here's how I'll compute a potential counteroffer's value: I'll try keeping a good amount of the more valuable items for myself, and giving more of the less valuable items to Player 2. This is just a starting point.\n            - If I keep 1 unit of item 1, that's worth 43.\n            - If I keep 2 units of item 2, that's worth 30.\n            - If I keep 3 units of item 3, that's worth 234.\n            - If I keep 3 units of item 4, that's worth 33.\n            - If I keep 4 units of item 5, that's worth 188.\n            This would make a total value for me of 528. \n        This means that I would give the other player 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    My counteroffer would give them [1, 2, 2, 4, 3]. If they accepted that, I would receive 528 which is much more than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will not walk away immediately since I have not even received a counteroffer yet, and I expect to be able to obtain an outcome that is more beneficial than my outside offer. I will offer a counteroffer to player 2.\n*   I will make a counteroffer to player 2 of giving them 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 4, 3]}\n```\n",

Let's think about a counteroffer where I get more valuable items.\n    I want a counteroffer to be worth more than 485.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 816\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 17 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 100 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 61 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 35 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 50 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that if the negotiation concludes in round 2, the value of the outcome is multiplied by 0.9, and if it concludes in round 3, the value of the outcome is multiplied by 0.9^2. This incentivizes reaching an agreement sooner rather than later. In round 1, the discount does not matter, since it is (0.9)^0 = 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I am player 1, I will propose a counteroffer and must consider potential counteroffers. I am trying to maximize my own value, but I also want to ensure the other player has an incentive to accept my offer.\n\n    Let's consider a few simple strategies for what my offer could look like. First, an even split of every item would be:\n        *   Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 0 unit of item 5\n        *   Player 1: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5\n\n        The value to Player 1 would be:\n        *   1 * 17 = 17\n        *   2 * 100 = 200\n        *   3 * 61 = 183\n        *   2 * 35 = 70\n        *   1 * 50 = 50\n        Total value = 520\n        This is less than my outside option, so I will offer a better offer to myself\n    \n    Let's consider giving player 2 half of all items, rounding down on half units:\n        *   Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 0 unit of item 5\n        *   Player 1: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5\n\n        The value to Player 1 is the same as before: 520.\n    \n    Instead, lets consider giving player 2 only low-value items, keeping all items where I have high valuation:\n    *    Player 2: 2 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4. 0 for items 2 and 5.\n    *    Player 1: 0 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5\n\n    The value of this offer to me is:\n    *   0 * 17 = 0\n    *   4 * 100 = 400\n    *   3 * 61 = 183\n    *   2 * 35 = 70\n    *   1 * 50 = 50\n    Total value = 703. This is still less than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's consider another offer where I keep all the high value items, and make the negotiation fair by only offering the other player a good selection of low value items:\n     *   Player 2: 2 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4\n     *   Player 1: 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5\n    The value of this offer to me is:\n    *   0 * 17 = 0\n    *   4 * 100 = 400\n    *   2 * 61 = 122\n    *   0 * 35 = 0\n    *   1 * 50 = 50\n    Total value = 572. This is much lower than the outside offer.\n\n     Let's consider an offer that gives me all the high value items and a minimum of low value items to give to the other player:\n    *    Player 2: 0 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3\n    *    Player 1: 2 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5.\n    The value of this offer to me is:\n    *   2 * 17 = 34\n    *   4 * 100 = 400\n    *   4 * 61 = 244\n    *   3 * 35 = 105\n    *   1 * 50 = 50\n    Total Value = 833. This is greater than my outside option, and I am taking almost all of the items. I think that this is the best strategy.\n    \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** I will not accept any offer with value less than 816.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I should make a counteroffer. I should not accept anything less than 816. As shown above, the best counteroffer is giving the other player 0 of items 1, 2, and 5, 1 of item 3, and 0 of item 4.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

To do this, I should try to take as much of the higher valued items.  Here are the calculations of the full value of all items:\n   * 2 units of item 1: 2 * 54 = 108\n   * 4 units of item 2: 4 * 69 = 276\n   * 5 units of item 3: 5 * 87 = 435\n   * 3 units of item 4: 3 * 24 = 72\n   * 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 79 = 79\n   * Total value of all items for me is 108 + 276 + 435 + 72 + 79 = 970\n    I am being offered 1 unit of item 3, meaning that I keep all other units.  The items remaining for me would be:\n   * 2 units of item 1: 2 * 54 = 108\n   * 4 units of item 2: 4 * 69 = 276\n   * 4 units of item 3: 4 * 87 = 348\n   * 3 units of item 4: 3 * 24 = 72\n   * 1 units of item 5: 1 * 79 = 79\n  Total value of these items is 108 + 276 + 348 + 72 + 79 = 883\n    I should definitely not take the current offer!\n    \n    I should try and make a counter offer which brings my value closer to the total value of all items or to my outside option.

This means they keep [0, 0, 5, 0, 1]\n    *   Value to me: (2 * 17) + (4 * 100) + (0 * 61) + (3 * 35) + (0 * 50) = 34 + 400 + 0 + 105 + 0 = 539\n    *   Discounted Value to me : 539 * 0.9 = 485.1\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine what constitutes a good counteroffer. Since the current offer is significantly lower than my outside offer, I should not accept. I should either walk away or make a counteroffer. Let's consider a counter offer that I value highly, and where I give the other player as little as possible.\nLet's consider offering the other player only 1 unit of item 3, and 0 of everything else. So I would have [2,4,4,3,1] units.\n    * Value to me if I keep 2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 1 of item 5: (2 * 17) + (4 * 100) + (4 * 61) + (3 * 35) + (1 * 50) = 34 + 400 + 244 + 105 + 50 = 833.\n    * Discounted value: 833 * 0.9 = 749.7\nThe other player's counteroffer is to keep [0, 0, 5, 0, 1] and give me [2,4,0,3,0]. The values that they receive are unknown, but since they are offering me a poor offer and then waiting until round 2 (where deals are discounted), they probably value some of the items I value high as well.\n    Given that my discounted value is already well below my outside option, making a counteroffer that is more in my favor seems sensible. \n    If they reject my counteroffer, I will just walk in round 3.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The discounted value of the current offer (485.1) is much lower than my outside offer (816). So I will not ACCEPT.\n*   I should not walk away now, as I can make a counter offer that is significantly higher value to me.\n*   I will make a counteroffer that is very advantageous to me, to try to obtain a good outcome. Specifically I will offer 1 unit of item 3 to the other player. This is [0, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This means that if we reach round 2, the value of any agreement will be multiplied by 0.9, and if we reach round 3, by 0.9^2 = 0.81. Delaying an agreement reduces its present value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since it's the first round, I need to make an initial offer. I need to consider how much of each item I am willing to give away, while also being mindful that I want an agreement that is more valuable than my outside option and that I should be reasonable to encourage the other player to accept an agreement, instead of walking and collecting their outside option.  I want to aim for as much as I can while ensuring it isn't rejected out of hand.\n\n    Let's consider an initial offer where I give roughly half of the items to the other player, as a start. I will offer player 2:\n     * 1 unit of item 1.\n     * 1 unit of item 2.\n     * 2 unit of item 3.\n     * 1 unit of item 4.\n     * 3 unit of item 5.\n\n     This would leave me with:\n      * 2 units of item 1\n      * 2 units of item 2\n      * 3 units of item 3\n      * 2 units of item 4\n      * 4 units of item 5\n     \n     My value would be:\n      * 2 * 20 = 40\n      * 2 * 66 = 132\n      * 3 * 3 = 9\n      * 2 * 57 = 114\n      * 4 * 92 = 368\n      Total = 663\n\n     Since this is greater than my outside offer I should offer this counteroffer. If I offered a lot less it would give Player 2 a better reason to walk away, and if I offered myself a lot less then I may not get above my outside offer when the discount is applied.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will propose the counteroffer as calculated above.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 3]}\n```\n",

Let's evaluate some potential counteroffers. I have a total potential value of (3*44) + (3*89) + (5*67) + (3*49) + (7*13) = 132 + 267 + 335 + 147 + 91 = 972.\n    * Option 1: I offer Player 1 half of each item: [1, 1, 2, 1, 3]. I receive [2, 2, 3, 2, 4]. My value = (2 * 44) + (2 * 89) + (3 * 67) + (2 * 49) + (4 * 13) = 88 + 178 + 201 + 98 + 52 = 617\n    * Option 2: I offer Player 1 1 unit of each item, plus 1 of item 3 and 1 of item 5, so [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]. My value is [2, 2, 3, 2, 5] = (2 * 44) + (2 * 89) + (3 * 67) + (2 * 49) + (5 * 13) = 88+178+201+98+65 = 630\n    * Option 3: I want to maximise my value, so I offer player 1 as little as possible to try and get the most value out of my 972. If I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], my total is 972. This is the highest it can be.\n    \n    *If I offer them [1, 1, 2, 1, 3], my value is 355. If I offer them 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 my value is 972. Anything else will have some value between 355 and 972.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer gives me 355, well below my outside offer of 740.\n*   Walking away gives me my outside offer of 740.\n*   Making a counteroffer could potentially get me something closer to 972, but it runs the risk of player 1 walking away with their outside offer.\n\nSince my outside offer is 740, and the current offer is 355, I will not accept the offer. Since I will always have the outside option of 740, I will start by making a very greedy counteroffer of offering them nothing to try and get the highest value possible and see how they react. This will give me 972. I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 740. This is my guaranteed fallback.\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 44, Item 2: 89, Item 3: 67, Item 4: 49, Item 5: 13\n*   **Total pool of items:** 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting a deal later is slightly less valuable than accepting it now, because the outcome is multiplied by gamma^(r-1).\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Let's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 44 = 44\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 89 = 89\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 67 = 67\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 49 = 49\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 13 = 13\n    *   Total value: 44 + 89 + 67 + 49 + 13 = 262\n\n    Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.  So the present value of this offer to me is 262 * 0.9 = 235.8\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what a good counteroffer might look like.  I need to keep in mind that if we get to round 3, and I make a counteroffer then that is the same as a WALK, so I need to try and get as much value as possible now. Since I have 972 total value, I want to aim for something close to half if I can. My current value would be 972 if I had all items, so a reasonable counteroffer would be something that gets me at least 740 if it is available.\n    * If I ask for all items, that is a value of 972.\n    * If I give them all the items, that is a value of 0.\n    * My outside value is 740.\n    * Given that Player 1's previous offers were not very generous, I believe that asking for all items would be most strategic for me.\n    If the counteroffer is successful, that is 972 * 0.9 = 874.8. This is much better than walking away with 740.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is 235.8 which is much worse than my outside offer of 740.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is not good. I need to try and get a better outcome this round, otherwise I will be forced to walk away. As such, I will ask for everything, meaning my counteroffer will be that I give the other player 0 of each item.\n   \n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This gives me a value of (3 * 20) + (3 * 66) + (5 * 3) + (3 * 57) + (7 * 92) = 60 + 198 + 15 + 171 + 644 = 1088. This is the highest value I can possibly achieve for the outcome and as this is round 3 the discount rate is irrelevant.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since this is the final round, and I can get the full value by simply accepting the current offer, any counteroffer I make will simply cause me to lose by having negotiations breakdown and I will be forced to take my outside offer.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My current value of 1088 is significantly better than my outside offer value of 528.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nGiven that the current offer gives me the maximum possible value, and I am in the final round, I should accept.

This is not ideal so I am not willing to take a large discount, let's offer a fairer offer, offering player 2 1/3 of all items.\n        *   Offer 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5.\n        My remaining share is 2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 2 of item 5.\n        My value: (2 * 92) + (4 * 48) + (5 * 76) + (2 * 98) + (2 * 47) = 184 + 192 + 380 + 196 + 94 = 1046\n    This is still low. Let's offer 1/4 of each item, rounded down.\n        *   Offer: 0 unit of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n        My remaining share is 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n        My value: (3 * 92) + (5 * 48) + (6 * 76) + (2 * 98) + (3 * 47) = 276 + 240 + 456 + 196 + 141 = 1309\n    This is also very close to my outside offer, let's offer slightly less.\n        *   Offer: 0 unit of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n        My remaining share is 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 7 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\n        My value: (3 * 92) + (5 * 48) + (7 * 76) + (2 * 98) + (3 * 47) = 276 + 240 + 532 + 196 + 141 = 1385\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will make the offer 0 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 0 unit of item 5. My value with this offer is 1385. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 201. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 53\n    *   Item 2: 49\n    *   Item 3: 27\n    *   Item 4: 12\n    *   Item 5: 8\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 6 units\n    *   Item 3: 7 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times as much as a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times a deal in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 1 unit of item 2, which is worth 1 * 49 = 49. This would leave me with:\n    *   3 units of item 1 = 3 * 53 = 159\n    *   5 units of item 2 = 5 * 49 = 245\n    *   7 units of item 3 = 7 * 27 = 189\n    *   2 units of item 4 = 2 * 12 = 24\n    *   3 units of item 5 = 3 * 8 = 24\n    * My total value would be 159 + 245 + 189 + 24 + 24 + 49= 690\n  \n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few potential counteroffers, keeping in mind I want to maximize my value above my outside option of 201. I'm going to calculate a few options to see what might be appealing.\n    *   **Option A: Demand almost everything**: Offer Player 1 [0,0,0,0,0]. This would give me a value of 690.\n    *   **Option B: Offer player 1 some of what I value least**: offer Player 1 [1,0,1,1,1]. My value would be (2*53) + (6*49) + (6*27) + (1*12) + (2*8) = 106+294+162+12+16=590.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer gives me a value of 49, which is significantly less than my outside option of 201. Option A of getting everything has the highest potential, so I'll try that.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of 49 is well below my outside option of 201. I will propose a counteroffer, and if player 1 rejects my offer, at least I'm no worse off than walking away at a 201 value. My preferred counteroffer for this round is to offer player 1 nothing.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This means I would get all the items:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 92 = 276\n    *   6 units of item 2: 6 * 48 = 288\n    *   7 units of item 3: 7 * 76 = 532\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 98 = 196\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 47 = 141\n    *   Total value: 276 + 288 + 532 + 196 + 141 = 1433\n    *   Discounted Value = 1433 * 0.9 = 1289.7\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   I need to consider counteroffers that are better than my outside offer (1317) when discounted at the current round.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n    *   The current offer gives me a discounted value of 1289.7 which is less than my outside offer of 1317. If I accept I'll receive less than my outside offer, thus it is not in my interest to accept.\n    *  I should not walk away as I can definitely receive a better offer.\n    *  Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer. I need to give Player 2 something to make a deal. I will offer them the minimum amount of each type of item. Therefore my counter offer will give them 1 unit of each item, except for item 4, as there are only 2 units of it.\n\n    * My counter offer: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] - this means I will keep 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5\n\n    * Value to me:\n        * 2 units of item 1: 2 * 92 = 184\n        * 5 units of item 2: 5 * 48 = 240\n        * 6 units of item 3: 6 * 76 = 456\n        * 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 98 = 98\n        * 2 unit of item 5: 2 * 47 = 94\n        * Total value = 184+240+456+98+94 = 1072\n        * Discounted Value = 1072 * 0.9 = 964.8\n\n    * This is not a good offer for me, as it is well below my outside option.

Let me revise my offer:\n\n    * Revised Counteroffer: I'll offer the player 1 unit of item 1 and item 4, as they have a higher value for me. Thus my counteroffer will be [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This will leave me with:\n        * 2 units of item 1: 2 * 92 = 184\n        * 6 units of item 2: 6 * 48 = 288\n        * 7 units of item 3: 7 * 76 = 532\n        * 1 units of item 4: 1 * 98 = 98\n        * 3 units of item 5: 3 * 47 = 141\n        * Total value: 184+288+532+98+141 = 1243\n        * Discounted Value = 1243 * 0.9 = 1118.7\n\n    * This is still below my outside option, but a reasonable compromise. Let's try something that will give me at least my outside option.\n\n    * Revised Counteroffer: I'll offer the player 1 unit of item 5 only, as it has the least value for me. Thus my counteroffer will be [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This will leave me with:\n        * 3 units of item 1: 3 * 92 = 276\n        * 6 units of item 2: 6 * 48 = 288\n        * 7 units of item 3: 7 * 76 = 532\n        * 2 units of item 4: 2 * 98 = 196\n        * 2 units of item 5: 2 * 47 = 94\n        * Total value: 276+288+532+196+94=1386\n        * Discounted value = 1386 * 0.9 = 1247.4\n\n    * This value is also less than the outside offer.\n\n    * Revised Counteroffer: I'll offer the player 1 unit of item 2 and item 5, as it has low value for me and leaves me with more high value items. Thus my counteroffer will be [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This will leave me with:\n        * 3 units of item 1: 3 * 92 = 276\n        * 5 units of item 2: 5 * 48 = 240\n        * 7 units of item 3: 7 * 76 = 532\n        * 2 units of item 4: 2 * 98 = 196\n        * 2 units of item 5: 2 * 47 = 94\n        * Total value: 276+240+532+196+94=1338\n        * Discounted value = 1338 * 0.9 = 1204.2\n\n    * This value is still less than the outside offer of 1317. I need to aim to obtain close to or above this, while giving the other player something reasonable. Let me try one more time:\n\n      * Revised Counteroffer: I will offer the other player 1 item of type 5 only. Therefore, my offer is [0,0,0,0,1].\n      * My value:\n           *  3 units of item 1: 3*92 = 276\n           * 6 units of item 2: 6*48 = 288\n           * 7 units of item 3: 7*76 = 532\n           * 2 units of item 4: 2*98 = 196\n           * 2 units of item 5: 2*47 = 94\n      * Total value: 276 + 288 + 532 + 196 + 94 = 1386\n      * Discounted Value = 1386 * 0.9 = 1247.4\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven that the current offer gives me a discounted value of 1289.7 which is less than my outside offer of 1317, I should not accept it. I also cannot walk away at this point, as I can still gain a more favorable outcome. Thus, I will make a counteroffer. I will offer Player 2 one unit of item 5, which gives me a discounted value of 1247.4. Even though this is still below my outside offer, given I'm in round 2, there isn't much room to bargain.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 201. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 447 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 201.\n*   **Item values:** My private values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 53\n    *   Item 2: 49\n    *   Item 3: 27\n    *   Item 4: 12\n    *   Item 5: 8\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 6 units\n    *   Item 3: 7 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is gamma = 0.9.  This means the value of an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value it would be in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I receive 1 unit of item 5. The value of this offer to me is:\n    *   1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 8 = 8\n    *   Since this is round 2, this value is discounted to 8 * 0.9^(2-1) = 8 * 0.9 = 7.2\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I want to ask for, and whether its value is higher than the discounted outside offer, and what my outside offer would be.\n   The maximum value I can get from all the items is:\n     (3 * 53) + (6 * 49) + (7 * 27) + (2 * 12) + (3 * 8) = 159 + 294 + 189 + 24 + 24 = 690\n    \n   The discounted value of my outside offer is 201 * 0.9^(2-1) = 201 * 0.9 = 180.9. I will consider a few counteroffers:\n\n      * Counteroffer 1: [0, 3, 3, 1, 1]  This would give me:\n            * 3 item 1 = 3 * 53 = 159\n            * 3 item 2 = 3 * 49 = 147\n            * 4 item 3 = 4 * 27 = 108\n            * 1 item 4 = 1 * 12 = 12\n            * 2 item 5 = 2 * 8 = 16\n            Total = 159 + 147 + 108 + 12 + 16 = 442. This is worth 442 * 0.9 = 397.8.\n      * Counteroffer 2: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]. This would give me:\n            * 3 item 1 = 3 * 53 = 159\n            * 4 item 2 = 4 * 49 = 196\n            * 5 item 3 = 5 * 27 = 135\n            * 2 item 4 = 2 * 12 = 24\n            * 3 item 5 = 3 * 8 = 24\n             Total = 159+196+135+24+24=538. This is worth 538 * 0.9 = 484.2.\n        This would leave the other player with:\n            * 0 item 1\n            * 2 item 2\n            * 5 item 3\n            * 2 item 4\n            * 3 item 5\n\n      *Counteroffer 3:  [1, 2, 2, 1, 1].  This would give me:\n            * 2 item 1 = 2 * 53 = 106\n            * 4 item 2 = 4 * 49 = 196\n            * 5 item 3 = 5 * 27 = 135\n            * 1 item 4 = 1 * 12 = 12\n            * 2 item 5 = 2 * 8 = 16\n             Total = 106 + 196 + 135 + 12 + 16 = 465.  This is worth 465 * 0.9 = 418.5.\n    \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer of 7.2 is much worse than my discounted outside offer of 180.9. All my counteroffers are worth more than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is terrible, and I can offer a counteroffer that is better than my discounted outside offer value, I will make counteroffer 3. It's a reasonable split, and if we go to the last round, I will not be able to make another offer, so my value would be much lower.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

I will test one option.\n    *   **Option 1:** Offer Player 2 half of all items (rounded down for item 4 and 5): Player 2 gets: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5.

I keep: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n         * Value of keeping Item 1: 4 * 52 = 208\n         * Value of keeping Item 2: 3 * 32 = 96\n         * Value of keeping Item 3: 3 * 19 = 57\n         * Value of keeping Item 4: 1 * 16 = 16\n         * Value of keeping Item 5: 1 * 5 = 5\n         * Total Value: 208 + 96 + 57 + 16 + 5 = 382\n\n     * **Option 3:** Offer Player 2 0 of each item. This means I keep all items which equates to total value of 490.\n\n    * **Comparing:** Options 1 and 2 are above my outside offer, and seem acceptable options to offer.

Let's try a counteroffer where I ask to keep all of item 3, which is my highest value. This would mean giving Player 1: [5, 4, 0, 1, 2] - this is an invalid counteroffer since player 1 can only receive at most [5, 4, 4, 1, 2].\n    * It seems the best I can do is to keep 3 units of item 3, with the remaining items being split more equally: [1, 1, 3, 0, 1]. Let's evaluate this:\n        * Value of this division to me: (1 * 33) + (1 * 54) + (3 * 83) + (0 * 67) + (1 * 36) = 33 + 54 + 249 + 0 + 36 = 372\n        * Player 1 would receive: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5. We know Player 1 does not value item 3 as much as I do, so it is reasonable to give them this.\n        * Discounted value of my new offer: 372 * 0.9 = 334.8\n    *  We know that if we don't make a counteroffer in round 3, we will have to accept our outside offer. With this in mind, and given that the discount factor for a deal in round 3 is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81, I need to consider whether making a counteroffer in round 2 is worth it compared to walking away and getting my guaranteed value of 754 now.\n    * The goal should be to find a counteroffer such that the discounted value is higher than 754. Given that the maximum I can have is 852, and if I get this in round 3 it will be worth 852 * 0.81 = 689, it makes sense to walk away now rather than hope to achieve a deal.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is significantly below my outside offer (182.7 < 754) and not worth it.\n*   If I were to propose a counteroffer, it would be worth less than my outside offer due to the discount factor.\n*   The only possible action to achieve a value greater than 754 is to take my outside offer and WALK away.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

The discount factor means that it is better to conclude negotiations earlier rather than later.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].

Comparing to my outside option of 406, this is a terrible offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to make a counteroffer that provides me with greater value than my outside offer, keeping in mind that I need to give the other player enough value to make a deal. Since this is round 1, I can aim high and try to get a good deal for myself. I want to keep the items I value more (1,3,5), while the other player has a chance to get a share of item 2.\n    *   Let's consider offering Player 1 [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]: This would mean I get to keep 2 items of type 1, 2 of type 2, 2 of type 3, 4 of type 4, and 4 of type 5. My value would be 2 * 82 + 2 * 55 + 2 * 64 + 4 * 11 + 4 * 65 = 164 + 110 + 128 + 44 + 260 = 706. Comparing to the 406, this would be a great value.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 744\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 95\n    *   Item 2: 9\n    *   Item 3: 17\n    *   Item 4: 96\n    *   Item 5: 97\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 3\n    *   Item 3: 2\n    *   Item 4: 4\n    *   Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer now is worth more than accepting the same offer next round. Specifically, a value *V* in this round will have a value of *0.9*V* in the next round, making it less desirable.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This means I receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 95 = 95\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 9 = 9\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 17 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 96 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 97 = 97\n    *   Total value of current offer: 95 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 97 = 201. This is far below my outside option.\n    \n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer which, when accepted (assuming rationality), I'd prefer over the outside option. I will consider keeping all the items and giving the remaining to player 2.\n    *   **Keeping all items:**\n    * Item 1: 3 * 95 = 285\n    * Item 2: 3 * 9 = 27\n    * Item 3: 2 * 17 = 34\n    * Item 4: 4 * 96 = 384\n    * Item 5: 5 * 97 = 485\n    * Total value = 285 + 27 + 34 + 384 + 485 = 1215. This would be the ideal but is unlikely.\n\n   Since I'm in round 2, there is still a chance to make a better deal than the current one. As the discount factor is 0.9, delaying a profitable deal is unfavorable unless a deal is made that makes up for the discount factor. I want to try and get a deal that at least beats the outside option, but gives me more. Let's try offering to give away 1 of each of item 1, 2, 4, and 5, since I value those the most. That would be an offer of [1,1,0,1,1].\n\n*   **Proposed counteroffer:** [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n    * Value of keeping items:\n    * Item 1: 2 * 95 = 190\n    * Item 2: 2 * 9 = 18\n    * Item 3: 2 * 17 = 34\n    * Item 4: 3 * 96 = 288\n    * Item 5: 4 * 97 = 388\n    * Total value = 190 + 18 + 34 + 288 + 388 = 918\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\nThe current offer gives me a value of 201, which is far below my outside offer of 744. My proposed counteroffer has a value of 918, which beats my outside offer. I'll make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

I should go for my outside offer, or perhaps try to squeeze out one more offer before walking.\n\nSince this is round 1 and I haven't yet proposed a counteroffer, and since I am player 2, the last offer will be treated as a walk if it happens on round 3. I would prefer to make one last offer and see how player 1 will react.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 589\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 70\n    *   Item 2: 19\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 83\n    *   Item 5: 55\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 6 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since it is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1. This will influence the value of future rounds, but not this round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  Since there is no current offer, I need to create an initial offer. I want to maximize my value, but need to be reasonable enough to entice the other player. Let's start by giving the other player half the items. If there are an odd number of items I will give the larger half to myself. So, I keep:\n     *   Item 1: 1 (0 to other player)\n     *   Item 2: 3 (3 to other player)\n     *   Item 3: 2 (2 to other player)\n     *   Item 4: 2 (2 to other player)\n     *   Item 5: 1 (1 to other player)\n    My value for this is:\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 70 = 70\n    *   Item 2: 3 * 19 = 57\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 4 = 8\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 83 = 166\n    *   Item 5: 1 * 55 = 55\n    *  Total: 70 + 57 + 8 + 166 + 55 = 356\n\n    Let's consider a more generous offer to the other player.  I will keep:\n     *   Item 1: 0 (1 to other player)\n     *   Item 2: 2 (4 to other player)\n     *   Item 3: 1 (3 to other player)\n     *   Item 4: 1 (3 to other player)\n     *   Item 5: 0 (2 to other player)\n     My value for this is:\n    *   Item 1: 0 * 70 = 0\n    *   Item 2: 2 * 19 = 38\n    *   Item 3: 1 * 4 = 4\n    *   Item 4: 1 * 83 = 83\n    *   Item 5: 0 * 55 = 0\n    *  Total: 0 + 38 + 4 + 83 + 0= 125\n    This is not greater than my outside offer.\n    Since my value under a potential equal-ish division (356) is less than my outside offer (589) I will try to keep more items. Let's offer the other player the following:\n    *   Item 1: 0 (1 to me)\n    *   Item 2: 2 (4 to me)\n    *   Item 3: 1 (3 to me)\n    *   Item 4: 1 (3 to me)\n    *   Item 5: 0 (2 to me)\n    My value for this offer is:\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 70 = 70\n    *   Item 2: 4 * 19 = 76\n    *   Item 3: 3 * 4 = 12\n    *   Item 4: 3 * 83 = 249\n    *   Item 5: 2 * 55 = 110\n    * Total: 70 + 76 + 12 + 249 + 110 = 517\n    This is not better than my outside offer of 589.\n\n    Let's offer very little to the other player. Let's offer:\n    *  Item 1: 0 to the other player\n    *  Item 2: 0 to the other player\n    *  Item 3: 0 to the other player\n    *  Item 4: 0 to the other player\n    *  Item 5: 0 to the other player\n    This gives me:\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 70 = 70\n    *   Item 2: 6 * 19 = 114\n    *   Item 3: 4 * 4 = 16\n    *   Item 4: 4 * 83 = 332\n    *   Item 5: 2 * 55 = 110\n    *   Total = 70 + 114 + 16 + 332 + 110 = 642\n    This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   I will offer the other player nothing and see if they will accept.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

Since it is round one, there is no discounting so any offer above 599 is better. I could start by making a counteroffer that gives the other player a small value while maximizing my outcome. Let's try an offer that leaves me with 90% of the value, we can achieve this while also being efficient, for example offering player 1 one unit of item 3 and one unit of item 4:\n    *   My value for an offer of [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] is calculated as:\n        *  1 unit of item 1: 1*81 = 81\n        *  6 units of item 2: 6*76 = 456\n        *  3 units of item 3: 3*87 = 261\n        *  3 units of item 4: 3*92 = 276\n        *  2 units of item 5: 2*41 = 82\n        *  Total value: 81 + 456 + 261 + 276 + 82 = 1156\n     \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The value of accepting the current offer (1335) or my proposed counteroffer (1156) are both much higher than my outside offer (599). Therefore, I should not walk away right now.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   I should **not** accept the current offer as I can get more value by offering a counter offer where I retain most of the items.\n*   I should **not** walk away, as I have offers available to me that are better than my outside offer.\n*   I should make the proposed **COUNTEROFFER** of [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

The value of this for me would be\n       (1 * 70) + (6 * 19) + (4 * 4) + (4 * 83) + (2 * 55) = 70 + 114 + 16 + 332 + 110 = 642\n       This is great!\n    *   If we split the items down the middle for items 2, 3 and 4 this would be: [0,3,2,2,0] and be worth: (1*70) + (3*19) + (2*4) + (2*83) + (2*55) = 70 + 57 + 8 + 166 + 110 = 411\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer is terrible, my value of 78.3 is much less than my outside offer of 589.\n    *   A counteroffer giving the other player nothing is worth 642 and is better than my outside offer. \n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is not acceptable.\n*   Walking away is an option, with value 589.\n*   I should make a counteroffer that is favorable to me. I should ask for all of the items: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer where I propose to keep all the items for myself.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an agreement in round 2 is worth 0.9 times what it would be in round 1 and 0.9^2 what it would be in round 3. Since we are in round 2, the value of any deal will be discounted by a factor of 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I get all the items.\n    *   My value for this offer is: (1 * 81) + (6 * 76) + (4 * 87) + (4 * 92) + (2 * 41) = 81 + 456 + 348 + 368 + 82 = 1335\n    *   The discounted value of this offer is 1335 * 0.9 = 1201.5\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I could consider various counteroffers, but it's not necessary at this point. The goal is to get the most possible value while considering the discount factor and the outside offer. Given that the current offer gives me almost double the value of my outside offer it is worth considering.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is significantly better than my outside offer of 599 * 0.9 = 539.1.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is very good. I should not walk away because the discounted value is so high. Accepting the current offer is better than walking away and there is no way to improve my value by giving Player 1 anything.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 374. This is my guaranteed value if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 27\n    *   Item 2: 85\n    *   Item 3: 81\n    *   Item 4: 55\n    *   Item 5: 80\n*   **Total items:** The total pool of items is:\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 6\n    *   Item 3: 9\n    *   Item 4: 1\n    *   Item 5: 8\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. Since this is round 2, if a deal is made this round, its value will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer on the table is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning Player 2 is offering me nothing. If I accept this offer I will receive a value of 0.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's calculate a reasonable counteroffer that gives me more than my outside option. First, let's consider keeping all items for myself:\n    * 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 27 = 81\n    * 6 units of item 2 = 6 * 85 = 510\n    * 9 units of item 3 = 9 * 81 = 729\n    * 1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 55 = 55\n    * 8 units of item 5 = 8 * 80 = 640\n    * Total value = 81 + 510 + 729 + 55 + 640 = 2015\n    Now let us consider an even split of the items with me keeping the remainder if the items cannot be evenly split.\n    *   Item 1: I keep 2, Player 2 keeps 1 = 2*27 = 54\n    *   Item 2: I keep 3, Player 2 keeps 3 = 3*85 = 255\n    *   Item 3: I keep 5, Player 2 keeps 4 = 5*81 = 405\n    *   Item 4: I keep 1, Player 2 keeps 0 = 1*55 = 55\n    *   Item 5: I keep 4, Player 2 keeps 4 = 4*80 = 320\n    * Total Value = 54 + 255 + 405 + 55 + 320 = 1089\n     If I offer the other player [1, 3, 4, 0, 4] my total value would be 1089. This value is higher than my outside offer. However, if I accept an offer this round my total value will be multiplied by 0.9. Thus, if I keep this value as my desired return my discounted value is 1089 * 0.9 = 980.1.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is clearly worse than my outside offer (0 vs 374). The counteroffer with a value of 1089 is much greater than the outside offer as well, even when it is multiplied by 0.9 in order to account for the current round.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   **Accept:** The current offer is not acceptable.\n*   **Walk:** Walking away will give me 374. This would be suboptimal compared to making a counter offer.\n*   **Counteroffer:** I should make a counteroffer that is more favorable for me. I will propose to keep an even split of items plus the remainder, offering Player 2 [1,3,4,0,4] (as calculated in the above analysis), as it has a value of 1089 when not discounted.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 4, 0, 4]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 839. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 852 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine my best action in this first round.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n*   **My Outside Offer Value:** 839. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 78\n    *   Item 2: 25\n    *   Item 3: 76\n    *   Item 4: 59\n    *   Item 5: 46\n*   **Total Pool of Items:**\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means any deal in later rounds is worth slightly less than a deal today.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since I'm the first to act, I need to consider what initial offer to make. My goal is to maximize my value, and I need to make a proposal that Player 2 might find acceptable, given that it's the first round and a walk is a very real possibility. I'm not going to go for a split that is overly generous to Player 2, but I need to offer something that is reasonable, not just the minimum.\n    *   Let's consider an initial counteroffer of giving Player 2 half (rounded down) of each item:  \n         [0, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n\n        *   My remaining items would be: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]\n            *   Item 1: 1 * 78 = 78\n            *   Item 2: 2 * 25 = 50\n            *   Item 3: 2 * 76 = 152\n            *   Item 4: 2 * 59 = 118\n            *   Item 5: 3 * 46 = 138\n            *   Total value of this counteroffer to me: 78 + 50 + 152 + 118 + 138 = 536\n\n        *   I would not accept this offer if the other player was making it. This is worse than my outside offer and represents a very low value to me.  If they accepted it, the discount rate would not be a factor (since it is round 1) so the value would be 536.\n\n         *   Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 2 20 percent of the items each\n        *   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] \n         *   My remaining items would be: [1, 3, 4, 3, 4]\n            *   Item 1: 1 * 78 = 78\n            *   Item 2: 3 * 25 = 75\n            *   Item 3: 4 * 76 = 304\n            *   Item 4: 3 * 59 = 177\n            *   Item 5: 4 * 46 = 184\n            *   Total value of this counteroffer to me: 78 + 75 + 304 + 177 + 184 = 818\n    \n        *  This is also less than my outside offer of 839.\n\n        *   Let's consider a counteroffer that offers them just 1 unit of items 4 and 5, keeping the others for myself\n        * [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n            *   My remaining items would be: [1, 3, 4, 2, 4]\n            *  Item 1: 1 * 78 = 78\n            *  Item 2: 3 * 25 = 75\n            *  Item 3: 4 * 76 = 304\n            *  Item 4: 2 * 59 = 118\n            *  Item 5: 4 * 46 = 184\n            *   Total value: 78 + 75 + 304 + 118 + 184 = 759\n            * This offer is also worse than my outside offer.\n\n        *   Let's consider an offer that is more generous. I will give them 1 unit each of items 1 and 3.\n        * [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n            *   My remaining items would be: [0, 3, 3, 3, 5]\n            * Item 1: 0 * 78 = 0\n            * Item 2: 3 * 25 = 75\n            * Item 3: 3 * 76 = 228\n            * Item 4: 3 * 59 = 177\n            * Item 5: 5 * 46 = 230\n            * Total value: 0 + 75 + 228 + 177 + 230 = 712\n\n        *   This is also worse than my outside offer. It seems I will need to keep more than I initially expected. Let's go for an offer that gives them 1 unit each of item 2 and 4.\n        *   [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n        *   My remaining items: [1, 2, 4, 2, 5]\n        *   Item 1: 1 * 78 = 78\n        *   Item 2: 2 * 25 = 50\n        *   Item 3: 4 * 76 = 304\n        *   Item 4: 2 * 59 = 118\n        *   Item 5: 5 * 46 = 230\n        *   Total value: 78 + 50 + 304 + 118 + 230 = 780\n        * This offer is also worse than my outside offer.\n\n        * Let's try an offer of only 1 unit of item 5:\n        * [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n            * My remaining items: [1, 3, 4, 3, 4]\n            *  Item 1: 1 * 78 = 78\n            *  Item 2: 3 * 25 = 75\n            *  Item 3: 4 * 76 = 304\n            *  Item 4: 3 * 59 = 177\n            *  Item 5: 4 * 46 = 184\n            *  Total value: 78+75+304+177+184 = 818\n        * This is worse than my outside offer.\n\n        * Let's try an offer of only 1 unit of item 3:\n        *   [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n            *   My remaining items: [1, 3, 3, 3, 5]\n            *  Item 1: 1 * 78 = 78\n            *  Item 2: 3 * 25 = 75\n            *  Item 3: 3 * 76 = 228\n            *  Item 4: 3 * 59 = 177\n            *  Item 5: 5 * 46 = 230\n            *  Total value: 78+75+228+177+230 = 788\n        *   This is also worse than my outside offer.\n\n        It seems that I am having trouble finding an offer that is better than my outside offer. However, I must make some offer to try to get a better value than my outside offer, since I will get that for walking out. Let's try an offer that gives them 1 unit of item 5.\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\n*   **Accept Current Offer?** No, there is no current offer.\n*   **Walk Away?** No, not yet. I will make one more attempt to negotiate.\n*   **Counteroffer?** Yes, I will propose the counteroffer that gives the other player 1 unit of item 5. This is an attempt to start with a proposal that isn't overly generous to them, but leaves some room for negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

However, this would give player 1 zero and they would likely reject, so I need to make a reasonable counter offer. It is round one, so I should not be too aggressive and should aim for a high but fair deal.\n*   To be slightly better than my outside offer, I need to target an overall value of above 451, say 460 to have some room for further negotiation, after discounting. I can achieve this by offering a smaller amount of items.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 839. This is my guaranteed fallback.\n*   **My item values:** 78 for item 1, 25 for item 2, 76 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 46 for item 5.\n*   **Total items:** 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*  **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that if we reach an agreement in round 2, the values will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.  This means that I would retain 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. Let's calculate the value:\n    * Item 1: 1 * 78 = 78\n    * Item 2: 2 * 25 = 50\n    * Item 3: 3 * 76 = 228\n    * Item 4: 2 * 59 = 118\n    * Item 5: 4 * 46 = 184\n    * **Total Value:** 78 + 50 + 228 + 118 + 184 = 658\n\n    Since it is round 2, this value is adjusted by a factor of 0.9: 658 * 0.9 = 592.2\n    This value is much lower than my outside offer of 839, meaning I should reject the offer.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I propose to take most of the valuable items and leave Player 2 with the lower value items, in order to maximize my value and still be a bit generous (but not too generous) so as to entice the other player.\n\n    I will aim for at least 839 (my outside offer value).  My value is currently 658, so I need to get quite a bit more. Lets try a counteroffer where I only give Player 2 one of each of the lower valued items and most of the other ones: [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]. This leaves me with 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\n\n    * Item 1: 1 * 78 = 78\n    * Item 2: 2 * 25 = 50\n    * Item 3: 3 * 76 = 228\n    * Item 4: 2 * 59 = 118\n    * Item 5: 3 * 46 = 138\n    * **Total value:** 78 + 50 + 228 + 118 + 138 = 612. This is before discounting. After discount factor 612 * 0.9 = 550.8 which is still too low.\n\n     Let's try a more ambitious counteroffer and only give player 2 item 5.  So my counteroffer will be [0, 0, 0, 0, 1].\n     This leaves me with\n    * Item 1: 1 * 78 = 78\n    * Item 2: 3 * 25 = 75\n    * Item 3: 4 * 76 = 304\n    * Item 4: 3 * 59 = 177\n    * Item 5: 4 * 46 = 184\n    * Total value = 78 + 75 + 304 + 177 + 184 = 818\n    * Discounted value = 818 * 0.9 = 736.2\n\n     Let's try an even more extreme counteroffer where I take everything except item 5, and give one unit of item 5 to player 2. I offer [0,0,0,0,1] which means I keep 1 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\n    * Item 1: 1 * 78 = 78\n    * Item 2: 3 * 25 = 75\n    * Item 3: 4 * 76 = 304\n    * Item 4: 3 * 59 = 177\n    * Item 5: 4 * 46 = 184\n    * **Total value:** 78 + 75 + 304 + 177 + 184 = 818\n    * Discounted value is 818 * 0.9 = 736.2.  Still lower than my outside offer.\n\n     Lets try taking everything and offering them nothing, [0,0,0,0,0]:\n    * Item 1: 1 * 78 = 78\n    * Item 2: 3 * 25 = 75\n    * Item 3: 4 * 76 = 304\n    * Item 4: 3 * 59 = 177\n    * Item 5: 5 * 46 = 230\n    * Total value: 78 + 75 + 304 + 177 + 230 = 864\n    * Discounted Value = 864 * 0.9 = 777.6\n\n    This is still below 839. Lets give 1 of each item, to make it a fair offer.\n    Counteroffer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]:\n        * Item 1: 0 * 78 = 0\n        * Item 2: 2 * 25 = 50\n        * Item 3: 3 * 76 = 228\n        * Item 4: 2 * 59 = 118\n        * Item 5: 4 * 46 = 184\n        * Total value:  0 + 50 + 228 + 118 + 184 = 580\n        * Discounted value: 580 * 0.9 = 522\n\nLet's aim for closer to my outside offer and see what happens. Let's try a counter offer where I give Player 2: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] . This is the current offer. Lets try and offer them less than that and offer [0,1,1,1,0].\n    * Item 1: 1 * 78 = 78\n    * Item 2: 2 * 25 = 50\n    * Item 3: 3 * 76 = 228\n    * Item 4: 2 * 59 = 118\n    * Item 5: 5 * 46 = 230\n    * Total: 78 + 50 + 228 + 118 + 230 = 704\n    * Discounted: 704 * 0.9 = 633.6\n\nLet's try giving away 0 items other than item 5, and offer [0,0,0,0,1].\n    * Item 1: 1 * 78 = 78\n    * Item 2: 3 * 25 = 75\n    * Item 3: 4 * 76 = 304\n    * Item 4: 3 * 59 = 177\n    * Item 5: 4 * 46 = 184\n    * Total: 78 + 75 + 304 + 177 + 184 = 818\n    * Discounted: 818 * 0.9 = 736.2\n\nLet's try offering [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n * Item 1: 1 * 78 = 78\n    * Item 2: 3 * 25 = 75\n    * Item 3: 4 * 76 = 304\n    * Item 4: 2 * 59 = 118\n    * Item 5: 5 * 46 = 230\n    * Total: 78 + 75 + 304 + 118 + 230 = 805\n    * Discounted: 805 * 0.9 = 724.5\n\nMy goal is to get as close to the outside offer as possible in this round.  My best bet at that is [0,0,0,0,1].\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is not acceptable, so I will make a counteroffer. I am giving 1 of item 5 to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

This means that the value of a deal in a later round is discounted compared to the current round. Since we are in round 2, the discount is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], which means I receive 1 unit of item 5, and player 1 is taking the rest. \n    * My value for the current offer =  1 unit of item 5 * 38 = 38\n   Since this is round 2, the discounted value to me is 38 * 0.9 = 34.2\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The value of accepting the current offer (34.2) is significantly lower than my outside offer (451). Therefore, accepting is not a good choice.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's think about what a good counteroffer could look like: My goal is to maximize the value I receive, which is the same as minimizing what I give away. Let's consider a counteroffer where I offer the other player some of the low valued items, and retain the higher value ones. \n\n  The previous round I offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This was rejected so they are valuing the items differently to me. I will now offer a slight modification on this, where I give more of the items with low values to Player 1, and retain more of the high value items for myself. Let's propose a counteroffer where I give Player 1: [0, 2, 2, 2, 1].\n  *   My remaining items would be: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 4 units of item 5.\n  *   The value of this counteroffer is (1 * 63) + (1* 28) + (2 * 64) + (1 * 5) + (4 * 38) = 63 + 28 + 128 + 5 + 152 = 376\n  *   The discounted value would be 376 * 0.9 = 338.4 This is still lower than my outside offer.\n \n  I will try making a more aggressive offer where I give away even more items of low value:\n    * I offer: [0, 3, 3, 3, 1]\n    * My remaining items would be: 1 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4 and 4 unit of item 5\n    *The value of this counteroffer to me would be: (1 * 63) + (0 * 28) + (1 * 64) + (0* 5) + (4 * 38) = 63 + 0 + 64 + 0 + 152 = 279\n    *The discounted value would be: 279 * 0.9 = 251.1 This is also lower than my outside offer.\n\nI need to think about the fact that this is round 2. If I make a counteroffer now, there is a chance player 1 will make a counteroffer which I can accept in the last round. If I WALK now I am guaranteed my outside offer, but I lose the chance for something better. If I believe that I can't obtain anything more than my outside offer, then I should walk. If I believe there is a chance the other player will accept a better offer then I should attempt to make a better offer now. I believe there is a chance that the other player may accept my original offer if I make it again, and there is still one more round available. Since my outside offer is my worst case, then I can always walk away in the next round if the other players offer is poor. I will go with my original offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n*   Accepting the current offer would give me a value of 34.2, which is far less than my outside offer of 451, so I won't accept.\n* I don't know what Player 1's offer will be next round, but I am willing to try another offer that hopefully will be better than walking away if they accept.\n*  I will propose my original counteroffer again.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 839\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 78, Item 2: 25, Item 3: 76, Item 4: 59, Item 5: 46\n*   **Total pool of items:** 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. We are in round 3, so the discount factor will be 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer gives me [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] meaning they get \n[1, 2, 3, 2, 4]. \n    *   My value from this offer is: (0 * 78) + (1 * 25) + (1 * 76) + (1 * 59) + (1 * 46) = 206.\n    *   My discounted value is 206 * 0.81 = 166.86\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to consider that this is round 3.  If I counteroffer and they reject, I'm left with my outside offer.\n    Since the previous offers have been [0,0,0,0,1], then [0,1,1,1,1] from round 1 and then the exact same again for round 2, I think that player 2 values items 2,3,4,5 a lot. I'm going to offer them only item 5, since it has low value for me. Let's calculate a counteroffer giving them more item 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4] means I get [1,3,4,3,1]\n    *   My value: (1 * 78) + (3 * 25) + (4 * 76) + (3 * 59) + (1 * 46) = 78 + 75 + 304 + 177 + 46 = 680.\n    *   My discounted value if accepted in this round is 680 * 0.81 = 550.8. This is less than my outside offer.\n    Lets also consider a counteroffer where I give them [0, 2, 2, 2, 2], this means I get [1, 1, 2, 1, 3]\n    *   My value: (1 * 78) + (1 * 25) + (2 * 76) + (1 * 59) + (3 * 46) = 78 + 25 + 152 + 59 + 138 = 452\n    *   My discounted value if accepted in this round is 452 * 0.81 = 366.12. This is less than my outside offer.\n     \n    Since this is the last round, and I will get my outside offer if I offer a counteroffer which gets rejected, I must choose the optimal action here.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Accepting the current offer gives me 166.86.\n    *   Any counteroffer rejected this round will give me 839.\n    *   My outside offer is 839.\n    It is clear that accepting the current offer is much worse than the other options.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the discounted value of accepting the offer (166.86) is much lower than my outside offer (839), and any counteroffer in round 3 will give me 839 if rejected, I should walk away from the negotiation.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

Since player 2 offered [1,1,1,1,1] in round 1, they might want closer to half of each item than I offered them in round 1. I need a counteroffer that is greater than my outside offer and which I feel is likely to be accepted (or at least not rejected). Let's calculate a counteroffer where I offer them [2,1,2,2,1]. I would keep:\n    * Item 1: 2 units = 2*31 = 62\n    * Item 2: 2 units = 2*39 = 78\n    * Item 3: 2 units = 2*23 = 46\n    * Item 4: 3 units = 3*94 = 282\n    * Item 5: 1 units = 1*38 = 38\n    Total = 506\n    Discounted value = 506 * 0.9 = 455.4\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Current offer discounted value (202.5) is greater than my outside offer (37).\n    *   The value of the counteroffer (455.4) is also greater than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n* The current offer has a discounted value of 202.5, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 37, so I should not walk away.\n* The counteroffer has a discounted value of 455.4, which is also significantly higher than my outside offer of 37. I should try to obtain this result, as the current offer is less valuable to me.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 245\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 37\n    *   Item 2: 75\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 97\n    *   Item 5: 54\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount factor influence:** The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) will reduce the value of any deal made in later rounds. Since this is round 1, the discount factor is (0.9)^(1-1) = 1, so it doesn't affect the value at this round. Waiting for future rounds will discount value by 0.9 in round 2, and 0.81 in round 3.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since this is round 1, I need to create an initial offer. I need to think about what I would get from accepting the offer and how to create the most value for myself. I need to maximize my value and if no agreement is made, I will take my outside offer. I want a division where I can get more than my outside offer value. Since I want more value and there is no current offer I will propose an offer that gives the player less than I get. I can start by offering Player 2 half the number of items they can get at most. \n    *   Offer Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5. \n    *   This leaves me with: 2 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n    *   My value if I accept this is:\n        *   Item 1: 2 * 37 = 74\n        *   Item 2: 2 * 75 = 150\n        *   Item 3: 2 * 5 = 10\n        *   Item 4: 1 * 97 = 97\n        *   Item 5: 2 * 54 = 108\n        *   Total value: 74 + 150 + 10 + 97 + 108 = 439\n    *   This is higher than my outside offer, so it's a good place to start.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer because there is none.\n*   I should not walk away, I have a chance to make more value than my outside offer.\n*   I should propose the counteroffer above.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1. So no discount for this round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 74 = 74\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 73 = 73\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 23 = 46\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 34 = 34\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 70 = 140\n    *   Total value of current offer: 74 + 73 + 46 + 34 + 140 = 367\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's see what I would get if I keep the max value for myself (i.e., I offer Player 1 the minimum possible).\n    *  My value with this offer (offering player 1 0 of every item): \n          * 3 * 74 + 3 * 73 + 4 * 23 + 2 * 34 + 4 * 70 = 222 + 219 + 92 + 68 + 280 = 881\n    *   An alternative would be to offer Player 1 the items that are worth the least to me. This is more difficult to evaluate since I don't know what items Player 1 values most.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 367, which is greater than my outside offer value of 322. Therefore, it would be beneficial to accept the current offer, if my goal was to make a deal right now. But I have 2 more rounds.\n Since this is round 1, I would want to make an offer that leaves me as much profit as possible while hopefully not making Player 1 walk away. In an attempt to extract more profit from Player 1, I will make a counteroffer that benefits me more. \nThe total amount of items are [3, 3, 4, 2, 4].\nI want to keep all of item 1, 2 and 5 for myself, and most of item 3 and 4.\nI'll offer Player 1 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of 367 is greater than my outside offer of 322, which means I could accept and secure a better outcome than my walk-away value.\nHowever, I will propose a counteroffer, which is more beneficial to me.

This means that any value we obtain in later rounds will be discounted.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table. So, I don't need to analyze an existing deal.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since this is round 1, I have to make the first offer. To avoid immediate walking I need to offer something to the other player. I will start by considering a \"fair\" offer that gives half of the items to each player where possible. If there is an odd number of a particular item, I'll give one more unit of that item to myself.\n    *   Offer to Player 2:\n        *   Item 1: 1 unit (I keep 2)\n        *   Item 2: 2 units (I keep 3)\n        *   Item 3: 1 unit (I keep 2)\n        *   Item 4: 2 units (I keep 3)\n        *   Item 5: 4 units (I keep 5)\n    *   Value to me if I make that offer:\n        *   Item 1: 2 * 89 = 178\n        *   Item 2: 3 * 71 = 213\n        *   Item 3: 2 * 77 = 154\n        *   Item 4: 3 * 89 = 267\n        *   Item 5: 5 * 49 = 245\n        *   Total value = 178 + 213 + 154 + 267 + 245 = 1057\n    *   Another strategy is to give the other player just 1 of each item, which would be:\n        * Item 1: 1 unit (I keep 2)\n        * Item 2: 1 unit (I keep 4)\n        * Item 3: 1 unit (I keep 2)\n        * Item 4: 1 unit (I keep 4)\n        * Item 5: 1 unit (I keep 8)\n    *   Value to me if I make that offer:\n        * Item 1: 2 * 89 = 178\n        * Item 2: 4 * 71 = 284\n        * Item 3: 2 * 77 = 154\n        * Item 4: 4 * 89 = 356\n        * Item 5: 8 * 49 = 392\n        * Total value = 178 + 284 + 154 + 356 + 392 = 1364\n\n   *   How do these values compare to my outside offer: I want to choose the offer that would leave me with a value of more than 987. The equal division offer results in a value of 1057 which is greater than my outside offer value and the alternative strategy would result in a value of 1364 which is also greater than my outside offer value. Because it leaves me with a larger value, I will go for this more aggressive strategy.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Since there's no current offer, I cannot accept.\n*   Since both the proposed counteroffers I've evaluated have values greater than my outside offer, I should make a counteroffer. I will choose the more aggressive counteroffer, as this leaves me with greater total value if accepted.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer to give the other player just 1 of each type of item.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Since this is round 1, the discount factor will be 0.9^(1-1) = 1.  It does not affect the value at this point.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive 1 unit of each item.\n    *   Value of 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 38 = 38\n    *   Value of 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 28 = 28\n    *   Value of 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 63 = 63\n    *   Value of 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 45 = 45\n    *   Value of 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 20 = 20\n    *   Total value of current offer: 38 + 28 + 63 + 45 + 20 = 194\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that would give me more value than my outside option of 593. A good place to start is by calculating the total value I would obtain by keeping all the items for myself:\n    *   Value of 3 units of item 1: 3 * 38 = 114\n    *   Value of 5 units of item 2: 5 * 28 = 140\n    *   Value of 3 units of item 3: 3 * 63 = 189\n    *   Value of 5 units of item 4: 5 * 45 = 225\n    *   Value of 9 units of item 5: 9 * 20 = 180\n    *   Total value of keeping everything: 114 + 140 + 189 + 225 + 180 = 848\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer (194) is significantly lower than my outside offer (593).\n    *   My total item value is 848.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of 194 is much less than my outside offer value of 593, so I should definitely not accept it.\n*   Walking away would secure my outside offer of 593.\n*   Since the discount rate is 1 for round 1, I have nothing to lose by making a counteroffer now.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer that gives me more value than my outside offer and is still reasonable, meaning that I get a significant share of the total item value. Since I currently only have 194 in hand, I should ask for as much as possible in the first round. As such, I will propose to receive all items minus one from each.\n*   Here is my counteroffer: I will offer Player 1 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. Thus, I will keep 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4 and 9 units of item 5\n\nBased on the above, I will propose the counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 169. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 495 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 169\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 67\n    *   Item 2: 5\n    *   Item 3: 22\n    *   Item 4: 62\n    *   Item 5: 9\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6\n    *   Item 2: 3\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value of the deal in round 1. It incentivizes reaching a deal earlier.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n\n    My value if I accept this offer:\n    *   4 * 67 = 268\n    *   2 * 5 = 10\n    *   3 * 22 = 66\n    *   2 * 62 = 124\n    *   2 * 9 = 18\n    *   Total value = 268 + 10 + 66 + 124 + 18 = 486\n\n    Comparing this to my outside offer value of 169, it is significantly better.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider possible counteroffers and their associated value. Given that we are at round 1, and with the discount factor, I want to maximize my value in this round.\n    I want to aim for a deal better than my outside option of 169. For instance, an offer that gives me at least half the items each would give me a high value.\n    Here's an example: Let's say I give Player 1 [3, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n    My retained items would be [3, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n    My value would be: \n    *   3 * 67 = 201\n    *   2 * 5 = 10\n    *   2 * 22 = 44\n    *   1 * 62 = 62\n    *   2 * 9 = 18\n    *   Total value = 335\n    This is much better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of [2, 1, 1, 0, 1] is worth 486 to me which is much better than my outside offer of 169. I could propose a counteroffer that favors me more. However, it's best to start with a more favorable counteroffer, since we are in round 1, then accept the current offer in round 2 if they do not accept. For example, I can offer [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], this will allow me to get [5, 3, 3, 2, 2] which is worth 5*67 + 3*5 + 3*22 + 2*62 + 2*9 = 335+15+66+124+18 = 558.\nGiven the current offer is so good, and we are in round 1, it is best to make a counteroffer to get more value from player 1.\n\nBased on this analysis, I should propose a counteroffer to get more value from Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Therefore, I should not accept.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer that gives player 1 the minimum while trying to maximize my items\n    * I will offer player 1 [0,0,0,0,0]\n    * This means I keep the items:\n        *  6 units of item 1: 6 * 67 = 402\n        *  3 units of item 2: 3 * 5 = 15\n        *  4 units of item 3: 4 * 22 = 88\n        *  2 units of item 4: 2 * 62 = 124\n        *  3 units of item 5: 3 * 9 = 27\n        *  Total value: 402+15+88+124+27 = 656\n        * Discounted value: 656 * 0.9 = 590.4\n\n*   It's important to note that the game is in Round 2. If I walk in round 2, my payoff is 169. If we do not agree in round 3, then we both get our outside offer values.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince 92.7 (discounted value of the current offer) is less than 169 (outside offer), and the game is in round 2, I should not accept the current offer.  I want to maximize my return, while also keeping in mind that any counteroffer at round 3 results in a WALK away for both of us. Therefore, I will offer the best offer I can for myself, which is the previously calculated counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Accepting it gives me 0, which is worse than my outside offer value of 169. A counteroffer that results in me getting all the items will have value 531.36, which is significantly higher than the outside offer. However, since this is the last round, any counteroffer is treated as a walk. Since making a counteroffer of 0 to each item is optimal (i.e. keeping all items for myself), the best action is to propose this counteroffer and since it will be treated as a walk, this effectively gets me the outside offer.\nTherefore, I should walk away and take my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

I want a fair deal that is better than my walkaway value.\n\nI will calculate my value if I were to keep each item for myself, then I will look to give some of the items to the other player, making sure that I still get more than my outside offer of 314. \nIf I keep all the items, my total value would be: \n(3 * 70) + (5 * 89) + (1 * 19) + (2 * 14) + (4 * 27) = 210 + 445 + 19 + 28 + 108 = 810\n\nSince the other player has no idea what my values are, a fair starting point may be a 50/50 split in items, but I would prefer to keep the more valuable items for myself, so instead I will offer half of the total units of each item type or half the total units rounded up to the nearest integer (keeping all the item 3 myself since there is only 1). I will offer Player 2:\n1 unit of item 1 (keeping 2) = 1 * 70 = 70\n3 units of item 2 (keeping 2) = 3 * 89 = 267\n0 unit of item 3 (keeping 1) = 0 * 19 = 0\n1 unit of item 4 (keeping 1) = 1 * 14 = 14\n2 units of item 5 (keeping 2) = 2 * 27 = 54\nMy value would be 70 + 267 + 0 + 14 + 54 = 407.\nIf I keep more of the high value items, for example, keeping 2 units of item 1, 3 of item 2, and 1 of items 3, 4 and 5, then my value would be:\n2 * 70 + 3* 89 + 1* 19 + 1* 14 + 1*27 = 140 + 267 + 19 + 14 + 27 = 467.\n\nI need to calculate how many of each item type to offer Player 2.\nI propose to offer Player 2:\n1 unit of item 1\n2 units of item 2\n0 units of item 3\n1 unit of item 4\n2 unit of item 5\nThis would result in a value of (2 * 70) + (3 * 89) + (1 * 19) + (1 * 14) + (2 * 27) = 140 + 267 + 19 + 14 + 54 = 494. This is also much more than my outside offer, so this would be beneficial.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\nI will propose the counteroffer, as my value for it is much greater than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 408. This is my guaranteed fallback option if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 28 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 48 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 77 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 62 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 60 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   3 units of item 1\n    *   5 units of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   4 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that the value of a deal in later rounds is worth less. The value of a deal at round r is multiplied by gamma^(r-1).\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 has offered me [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 28 = 28\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 48 = 96\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 77 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 62 = 62\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 60 = 120\n    *   Total value of current offer = 28 + 96 + 0 + 62 + 120 = 306.\n    Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1, so the discounted value is 306 * 1 = 306.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The value of the current offer (306) is less than my outside offer (408). Thus, accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer that favors me more. I will determine the best possible offer to myself by determining what happens if I take all the items.\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 28 = 84\n    *   5 units of item 2: 5 * 48 = 240\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 77 = 77\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 62 = 124\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 60 = 240\n    *   Total value if I take all items = 84 + 240 + 77 + 124 + 240 = 765\n    I will try for a more favorable offer to me than the current offer, but not as favorable as keeping all items, because that will likely be rejected and I will walk away. I will try to get at least my outside offer value. I'll make a counteroffer where I get 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5. This leaves Player 1 with 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\n    Value of this counteroffer to me:\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 28 = 56\n        *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 48 = 144\n        *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 77 = 77\n        *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 62 = 62\n        *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 60 = 120\n        *   Total value: 56 + 144 + 77 + 62 + 120 = 459\n    This is greater than my outside offer value. \n    My counteroffer is that I will keep [2, 3, 1, 1, 2], thus Player 1 will get [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n    Thus my counteroffer is [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is not acceptable because its discounted value is 306, which is less than my outside offer value of 408.\n*   Walking away would give me my outside offer of 408.\n*   A counteroffer that yields a value greater than 408 for myself and does not give player 1 everything could result in an outcome better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer of [1, 2, 0, 1, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

For example, let's calculate the value of keeping 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5, and offering the rest to the opponent. This would mean a counteroffer of [1, 2, 0, 1, 2], which is the same as the current offer. Let's instead consider a counteroffer where I keep 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, and offer 0, 1, 0, 0, 1.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that any deal in round 2 has a value of 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9 times its face value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me \\[0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

A counteroffer at this point is just walking.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] yields 688.5 after discounting, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 408.\n*   A counteroffer in round 2 is treated as a walk, so will lead to my outside offer.\n\n**Final Action**\n\nGiven the analysis, the best course of action is to ACCEPT the current offer as it is better than my outside option and does not lose value by being in a later round.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

My goal is to retain more of the higher value items and offer more of the lower value items to Player 1. I could try to get almost all of the items, but this is likely to be rejected. I must consider the discount, such that I want a good offer soon, rather than waiting. I will need to see how Player 1 responds. For now, let's see if I can improve the offer by increasing the items I receive:\n    * Keeping 3 units of item 1, all 2 units of item 2, all 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 5 of item 5\n        * Items Offered: 2 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 0 of item 5\n        *   Value calculation:\n            *  3 * 68 + 2 * 29 + 4 * 67 + 1 * 18 + 5 * 75 = 204 + 58 + 268 + 18 + 375 = 923\n    * Keeping 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and all 5 units of item 5\n        * Items Offered: 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 0 of item 5\n        * Value calculation:\n            * 3 * 68 + 1 * 29 + 3 * 67 + 1 * 18 + 5 * 75 = 204 + 29 + 201 + 18 + 375 = 827\n    * Keeping 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and all 5 units of item 5\n        * Items Offered: 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 0 of item 5\n        * Value calculation:\n            * 4 * 68 + 1 * 29 + 3 * 67 + 1 * 18 + 5 * 75 = 272 + 29 + 201 + 18 + 375 = 895\n        *  Let's try offering [1,1,1,2,0].\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n*   I will offer a counteroffer that has more value than the current offer and is likely to be accepted.\n* I will counteroffer with [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 305\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 51, Item 2: 65, Item 3: 28, Item 4: 60, Item 5: 1\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be applied as 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer value:** The current offer on the table is [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]. This means Player 2 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  My value for this offer is calculated as follows:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 51 = 51\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 65 = 65\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 28 = 28\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 60 = 120\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 1 = 0\n    *   Total value = 51 + 65 + 28 + 120 + 0 = 264\n    *   Discounted value = 264 * 0.9 = 237.6\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that give me a value greater than my outside offer of 305, *after* the discount is applied. I need a discounted value of at least 305, so my value *before* discount must be at least 305/0.9 = 338.89. Let's calculate what I would receive if I kept all the items:\n    *   5 units of item 1: 5 * 51 = 255\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 65 = 130\n    *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 28 = 112\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 60 = 180\n    *   5 units of item 5: 5 * 1 = 5\n    *   Total value = 255 + 130 + 112 + 180 + 5 = 682\n    Since we need a value of at least 338.89, but we will be discounting any offer now, I will start with an aggressive counteroffer. I will propose a counteroffer where I receive the vast majority of the items, and therefore have high value and hopefully the other player accepts.\n\n        Let's consider offering [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] to Player 2.\n       \n        I keep the remainder of the items:\n       *   Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4\n       *   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2\n       *   Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3\n       *   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2\n       *   Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4\n       My value:\n       *   Item 1: 4 * 51 = 204\n       *   Item 2: 2 * 65 = 130\n       *   Item 3: 3 * 28 = 84\n       *   Item 4: 2 * 60 = 120\n       *   Item 5: 4 * 1 = 4\n       Total value: 204 + 130 + 84 + 120 + 4 = 542\n       Discounted value = 542 * 0.9 = 487.8\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 237.6, which is less than my outside offer of 305. The potential counteroffer to give Player 2 [1,0,1,1,1] is worth 487.8 to me, which is a much better outcome.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of 237.6 is below my outside offer of 305. I should not accept this offer. Walking away would give me a value of 305 * 0.9 = 274.5. I should therefore attempt to make a counteroffer.\n\nI will propose the counteroffer of giving Player 2 [1,0,1,1,1], which yields me 487.8.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This means they are giving me 1 unit of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer: (1 * 68) + (0 * 29) + (1 * 67) + (1 * 18) + (1 * 75) = 68 + 0 + 67 + 18 + 75 = 228\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 228 * 0.9 = 205.2\n\n*  **Previous Offer from Round 1:** Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 0] to Player 1.

Because it is round 2, if I offer a counteroffer that is not accepted, the game ends on round 3 with my walk offer. If Player 1 doesn't offer me a good deal, it is better for me to counteroffer than to walk away now, unless I cannot possibly formulate a counteroffer better than 647*0.9 = 582.3. I will start by examining counteroffers where I take the majority of the items for myself. This means I offer the minimum of 1 to Player 1 for each item.\n    *   **Counteroffer 1: Offer player 1 the minimum amount of each item: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]**\n        *   My remaining items: [4, 1, 3, 2, 4]\n        *   My value: (4 * 68) + (1 * 29) + (3 * 67) + (2 * 18) + (4 * 75) = 272 + 29 + 201 + 36 + 300 = 838\n        *   Discounted value: 838 * 0.9 = 754.2\n    *   **Counteroffer 2: Let's try offering slightly more to the other player: [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]**\n        *   My remaining items: [3, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n        *   My value: (3 * 68) + (1 * 29) + (2 * 67) + (2 * 18) + (3 * 75) = 204 + 29 + 134 + 36 + 225 = 628\n        *  Discounted value: 628 * 0.9 = 565.2\n\n*  **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n    * My outside offer value discounted to round 2 is 647 * 0.9 = 582.3\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 205.2, which is significantly lower than my outside offer of 582.3. Thus, I will not accept.\n* Counteroffer 1 offers a discounted value of 754.2, which is much better than my outside offer. Counteroffer 2 is lower than my outside offer, so it's worse.

As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 91.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 96 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 38 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 59 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 14 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 84 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 0 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 0 units\n*   **Discount factor:** Gamma (\u03b3) is 0.9. This means that the value of any agreement will be reduced by 0.9^(r-1), where r is the round in which the agreement is reached. In this round (r=1) the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1, which means the discount factor has no impact. However, it will impact future rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so accepting it would give me a value of 0 (which is worse than my outside offer value).\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I am the first player, I need to make an initial counteroffer. I should aim for a distribution that gives me more than 91. Let's try to calculate what the value of keeping some of the items for myself would be to determine what a reasonable counteroffer might look like.\n    *   **Keeping all items:**\n    (2 * 96) + (5 * 38) + (0 * 59) + (5 * 14) + (0 * 84) = 192 + 190 + 0 + 70 + 0 = 452\n\nLet's think of an aggressive offer, where I keep almost everything. For example, give Player 2 0 unit of items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. This means I have to calculate the value of me receiving all of these items (which we calculated above as 452) and divide by two, which gives 226, and that's a number to start at, then we can give Player 2 slightly more until we feel like it's fair.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2 an offer of [0, 1, 0, 1, 0].\nMy remaining items would be [2, 4, 0, 4, 0]\nMy total value = (2 * 96) + (4 * 38) + (0 * 59) + (4 * 14) + (0 * 84) = 192 + 152 + 0 + 56 + 0 = 400\n\nThis is above my outside offer value. Therefore, this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nI will propose a counteroffer that gives Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This value to me is 400, which is well above my outside offer value of 91. It also gives Player 2 a small, but potentially worthwhile value.\nTherefore, this is my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

I will offer player 1 some items, while keeping the rest for myself. Let's consider offering them half of each item.\n    *   Counteroffer: [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]. This means I would keep [1, 3, 0, 3, 0]\n        *   My value for this counteroffer:\n            *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 10 = 10\n            *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 86 = 258\n            *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 3 = 0\n            *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 38 = 114\n            *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 81 = 0\n            *   Total value: 10 + 258 + 0 + 114 + 0 = 382\n     *   Counteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

However, it seems there are counteroffers which could be much better. The highest possible value I could get would be 640.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is better than my outside offer but it is not optimal. It is round 1 so the discount factor does not affect my decision. I should make a counteroffer that will give me more value and leave the negotiation open to get more value in round 2 or 3. I will offer the other player [1, 2, 0, 2, 0], keeping the rest for myself.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]}\n```\n",

Given that the other player has previously offered me [1, 2, 0, 2, 0] and I initially offered [0,1,0,1,0], I will focus on what I can get from item 1 since my value for it is large, as well as item 4 since I don't value that very much.\n\n    *   **Option 1: Counteroffer of [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]**\n        This means I would keep 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n        *   Value of item 1: 2 * 96 = 192\n        *   Value of item 2: 3 * 38 = 114\n        *   Value of item 3: 0 * 59 = 0\n        *   Value of item 4: 4 * 14 = 56\n        *   Value of item 5: 0 * 84 = 0\n        *   Total value: 192 + 114 + 0 + 56 + 0 = 362.\n        *   Discounted value = 362 * 0.9 = 325.8.\n\n    *   **Option 2: Counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]**\n        This means I would keep all of the items.\n        * Value of item 1: 2 * 96 = 192\n        * Value of item 2: 5 * 38 = 190\n        * Value of item 3: 0 * 59 = 0\n        * Value of item 4: 5 * 14 = 70\n        * Value of item 5: 0 * 84 = 0\n        * Total value = 452\n        * Discounted value = 452 * 0.9 = 406.8\n\n    *   **Option 3: Counteroffer of [1, 3, 0, 3, 0]**\n        This means I would keep 1 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n        * Value of item 1: 1 * 96 = 96\n        * Value of item 2: 2 * 38 = 76\n        * Value of item 3: 0 * 59 = 0\n        * Value of item 4: 2 * 14 = 28\n        * Value of item 5: 0 * 84 = 0\n        * Total value = 200\n        * Discounted value = 200 * 0.9 = 180\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's discounted value (180) is much higher than my outside offer (91). However, counteroffer option 1 and 2 provide a much better result than the current offer. Option 3, results in the same result as the current offer and does not improve anything.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nAccepting the current offer provides a discounted value of 180 which is higher than my outside option. The potential counteroffer of [0, 2, 0, 1, 0] results in a better discounted value of 325.8 and the potential counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] results in a best discounted value of 406.8. I will choose counteroffer [0,0,0,0,0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

A fair initial offer might be one where each side gets about half of the total value.

A good starting offer may be to give player 2 half of each item rounded down, except for item 3 where it would be appropriate to give 3, since giving only 2 would give P2 a much lower relative value. So the offer to Player 2 will be [1, 1, 3, 2, 2]. Now let's calculate the value of what I keep if I give that to P2.\n        *   My items\n            * Item 1: 3-1 = 2 units * 39 = 78\n            * Item 2: 2-1 = 1 unit * 82 = 82\n            * Item 3: 5-3 = 2 units * 95 = 190\n            * Item 4: 4-2 = 2 units * 19 = 38\n            * Item 5: 4-2 = 2 units * 39 = 78\n        *   Total Value to Me: 466.\n       *  Since my value is 466 which is more than my outside offer of 426, this is an acceptable initial offer to test the other player.\n        \n**3) Make a decision:**\n    * I should not accept the current offer, since there isn't one.\n    * I should not walk away yet, because my outside offer is smaller than the value of what I would have after a counteroffer.\n    * I should make the counteroffer that I calculated above.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1343\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 43 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 16 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 89 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 98 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 89 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 1, 3, 2, 2]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    My value for the current offer is:\n    (2 * 43) + (1 * 16) + (2 * 89) + (2 * 98) + (2 * 89) = 86 + 16 + 178 + 196 + 178 = 654.\n    Since this is round 1, the discounted value is also 654.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I could calculate many counteroffers. It is useful to first consider if the current offer is acceptable compared to the outside offer value.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    The current offer value (654) is much lower than my outside offer value (1343). Accepting this offer would be a bad choice.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is significantly lower than my outside offer, so I will not accept it. Given that this is the first round, I should try to negotiate and make a counteroffer. I should try to get as much as I can while also trying to be reasonable to avoid a walk. Let's offer them a fair split of all the items. Here is the split:\n    * Item 1: 1\n    * Item 2: 1\n    * Item 3: 2\n    * Item 4: 2\n    * Item 5: 2\nThis means that I am keeping the rest of the items:\n    * Item 1: 2\n    * Item 2: 1\n    * Item 3: 3\n    * Item 4: 2\n    * Item 5: 2\nMy value for this is: (2 * 43) + (1 * 16) + (3 * 89) + (2 * 98) + (2 * 89) = 86 + 16 + 267 + 196 + 178 = 743.\nThis is better than the current offer, but still less than the outside offer. However, this counteroffer provides a more reasonable starting point and better than the current offer, so I should make this counteroffer to start negotiation.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

I should make an offer that gives me something closer to my total value without being too greedy to incite a walk. Given my total possible value was 988, it is not realistic that I would be able to keep everything and have Player 2 accept this. I will try to make an offer that gives me more than the current offer, and which might be accepted by the other player.\n    I will first check if I can improve my outcome by proposing an offer that gives the other player 1 unit each, except item 3 of which I will offer 3 units to them.\n    My proposed offer will be [1,1,3,1,1]. Which means my allocation will be [2,1,2,3,3].\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 39 = 78\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 82 = 82\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 95 = 190\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 19 = 57\n    *  3 units of item 5: 3 * 39 = 117\n    *   Total value of my offer: 78 + 82 + 190 + 57 + 117 = 524\n    *   Discounted Value: 524 * 0.9 = 471.6\n      This would still be below my outside offer so I should check if other counteroffers are better. \n    Since the game will end at this round if I make another offer, and it is likely that player 2 will walk with an offer that is too harsh, it is more reasonable to accept this deal.\n    \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    * The current offer (504.9) is greater than my outside offer (426).

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 3, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 3, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 769\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 78\n    *   Item 2: 77\n    *   Item 3: 23\n    *   Item 4: 16\n    *   Item 5: 44\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that any value we receive in later rounds is multiplied by gamma^(round - 1). So if this negotiation ends after round 1, the value is multiplied by 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1. If it ends after round 2, the value is multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9, and if it ends after round 3 the value is multiplied by 0.9^(3-1)=0.9^2=0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 3, 2, 0] which means they keep [6-2, 4-1, 5-3, 4-2, 1-0] = [4, 3, 2, 2, 1]\n    *   My value for this offer:\n        *   2 units of Item 1: 2 * 78 = 156\n        *   1 unit of Item 2: 1 * 77 = 77\n        *   3 units of Item 3: 3 * 23 = 69\n        *   2 units of Item 4: 2 * 16 = 32\n        *   0 units of Item 5: 0 * 44 = 0\n        *   Total value = 156 + 77 + 69 + 32 + 0 = 334\n    *   Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 1, and therefore the value to me of the current offer is 334.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider a counteroffer that gives me a better outcome than my outside offer. It would have to be significantly better than the 334 I would get from accepting. There is not much time available for this, so I will create an offer that I believe the other player will find attractive, and that gives me more than my outside offer.\n\n    For example, if we split everything in half (approximately, except for the odd item 5) this could be attractive to both sides.\n        * I give to player 1: [3, 2, 2, 2, 0]. I keep [3,2,3,2,1].\n            * Value to me would be 3 * 78 + 2 * 77 + 3 * 23 + 2 * 16 + 1 * 44 = 234 + 154 + 69 + 32 + 44 = 533\n        *If I offer player 1 [2, 1, 2, 1, 0] i keep [4, 3, 3, 3, 1]\n            *value to me would be 4*78 + 3*77+ 3*23+3*16+1*44 = 312 + 231 + 69 + 48 + 44 = 704\n        *If I offer player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] i keep [5, 3, 4, 3, 1]\n           *value to me would be 5*78 + 3*77+ 4*23+3*16+1*44 = 390 + 231 + 92 + 48 + 44 = 805\n\n        If I offer player 1 [1, 1, 2, 1, 0] i keep [5, 3, 3, 3, 1]\n            *value to me would be 5*78 + 3*77+ 3*23+3*16+1*44 = 390 + 231 + 69 + 48 + 44 = 782\n        \n            \n* **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer of 334 is well below my outside offer of 769. Therefore I should not accept. The counteroffers I made are more valuable than the original offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is not good enough.\n*   My outside offer is higher, but if I make a good enough counter offer, I can get more than my outside offer.\n*  I will make a counter offer.\n* The counteroffer [1, 1, 2, 1, 0] giving me 782, while reasonable, would be worse than my outside option once it's discounted at round 2, and would very likely be rejected. I need a higher value for my next counteroffer. \nThe counteroffer [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], giving me 805 before discounting, is good enough.\n\nTherefore I will make the counteroffer [1,1,1,1,0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

This means that an agreement in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of an agreement in round 1. Since we are currently in round 2, there is one round left where the discount factor will be applied if there is no agreement.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer on the table is that Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] of each item. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 57 = 57\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 92 = 92\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 27 = 27\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 41 = 41\n    *   0 unit of item 5: 0 * 78 = 0\n    *   Total value of the current offer: 57 + 92 + 27 + 41 + 0 = 217.\n    *   Since we are in round 2, the discounted value of the current offer is 217 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 217 * 0.9 = 195.3\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what counteroffer I could make that would be valuable to me. It is very important to remember this is round 2, so if I counter offer and they don't accept, there will be no further offers. I could try to get a deal where I get everything. Here's the calculation for me getting everything:\n    * 6 units of item 1: 6 * 57 = 342\n    * 4 units of item 2: 4 * 92 = 368\n    * 5 units of item 3: 5 * 27 = 135\n    * 4 units of item 4: 4 * 41 = 164\n    * 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 78 = 78\n    * Total value: 342 + 368 + 135 + 164 + 78 = 1087\n    * Discounted value of me getting everything: 1087 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 1087 * 0.9 = 978.3\n\n    Let's also calculate the value of my original offer of [2,1,3,2,0] to see if it's better than the current offer. This was rejected, but it's good to know.\n    * 4 units of item 1: 4 * 57 = 228\n    * 3 units of item 2: 3 * 92 = 276\n    * 2 units of item 3: 2 * 27 = 54\n    * 2 units of item 4: 2 * 41 = 82\n    * 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 78 = 78\n    * Total value: 228 + 276 + 54 + 82 + 78 = 718\n    * Discounted value: 718 * 0.9 = 646.2\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n    *   The current offer (195.3) is much worse than my outside offer (575).\n    *   My original offer (646.2) is better than my outside offer.\n    *   The best possible outcome (978.3) is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is far below my outside offer value. Accepting the offer would be a bad choice. I don't want to walk away since my previous offer was better than my outside offer. So, my best move here is to make a counteroffer to try to get closer to the best possible outcome. I will offer everything to myself except 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5, because that is what Player 2 is asking for. If we can get a deal that gives us the entire total value minus the value of the other's player current offer, then we are better off than taking our outside offers.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

This means that if I accept the offer now I get:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 0 units\n     I will get the other items if I accept the offer now, so Player 1 gets:\n    *   Item 1: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1 units\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Value of accepting the current offer:**\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 78 = 78\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 77 = 77\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 23 = 23\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 16 = 16\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 44 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer = 78 + 77 + 23 + 16 + 0 = 194. This value gets discounted by 0.9 = 194 * 0.9 = 174.6\n    \n*   **Potential counteroffers:** \n     I could try to make a counteroffer that gives myself more value than the current offer while still being acceptable to Player 1, but we must also consider the risk of the negotiation collapsing.\n    Let's consider an offer where I get half of all items, except for item 5: [3, 2, 2, 2, 0]. This means I would give to Player 1: \n    *   Item 1: 3 units.\n    *   Item 2: 2 units.\n    *   Item 3: 2 units.\n    *   Item 4: 2 units.\n    *   Item 5: 0 units.\nThis implies I would receive:\n    * Item 1: 6-3 = 3 units.\n    * Item 2: 4-2 = 2 units.\n    * Item 3: 5-2 = 3 units.\n    * Item 4: 4-2 = 2 units.\n    * Item 5: 1-0 = 1 unit.\n    Value of this to me = (3*78) + (2*77) + (3*23) + (2*16) + (1*44) = 234 + 154 + 69 + 32 + 44 = 533.  With the discount factor it would be 533 * 0.9 = 479.7.\n\n  * Lets now consider an offer where I give player one 1 less of each item than they asked for, specifically, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The value of this to me would be:\n    * Item 1: 6 * 78 = 468\n    * Item 2: 4 * 77 = 308\n    * Item 3: 5 * 23 = 115\n    * Item 4: 4 * 16 = 64\n    * Item 5: 1 * 44 = 44\n    Total = 999 * 0.9 = 899.1\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The discounted value of the current offer (174.6) is significantly less than my outside offer value (769).\n    *   The discounted value of the half-items offer (479.7) is also less than my outside offer value (769).\n    *   The discounted value of giving the other agent nothing (899.1) is much larger than my outside offer.\n    *  However, a counter offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] will most likely be rejected. \n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n   Accepting the current offer is not good. Proposing an offer that I get all items is a gamble, since Player 1 will likely reject it and then we both get our outside offers. Walking away is a definite outcome with value 769.\n   Let us consider if I gave them one unit of all items, this would be a counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] . Then my value would be:\n    * Item 1: 5 * 78 = 390\n    * Item 2: 3 * 77 = 231\n    * Item 3: 4 * 23 = 92\n    * Item 4: 3 * 16 = 48\n    * Item 5: 0 * 44 = 0\n    Total = 761 * 0.9 = 684.9\n    \n   I am going to counteroffer, giving the other agent a small increase, in order to get a deal that is better than my outside offer. I will give them [2, 2, 2, 2, 0].\n     Value of this offer to me:\n       * Item 1: 4 * 78 = 312\n       * Item 2: 2 * 77 = 154\n       * Item 3: 3 * 23 = 69\n       * Item 4: 2 * 16 = 32\n       * Item 5: 1 * 44 = 44\n     Total value = 611 * 0.9 = 549.9\n\n   Given the risks of having the negotiation collapse, it's better to propose a fair offer, which gives me more than the previous offer while still giving Player 1 something that would be of value to them.\n \n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 2, 0]}\n```\n",

We are in round 3, so the discount factor will be 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81. If we reach a deal in this round, it will be multiplied by 0.81.  Therefore, we need to make sure the deal is valuable enough to overcome the 0.81 reduction in our value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is that I receive [2, 2, 2, 2, 0] (meaning Player 2 would receive [4, 2, 3, 2, 1]).

Given this, I will not consider any counteroffers.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The discounted value of the current offer (351.54) is significantly less than my outside offer (575).\n*   Since a counteroffer on my part has little value because this is the final round, it is not in my best interest to counter.\n\nTherefore, I should walk away and take my outside offer of 575.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 5, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 5, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 720.\n*   **Item values:** My values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 10\n    *   Item 2: 15\n    *   Item 3: 65\n    *   Item 4: 36\n    *   Item 5: 37\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 10 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that the value of any deal is multiplied by 0.9^(r-1), where r is the round number. Since we are in round 1 the factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 5, 2, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 10 = 20\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 15 = 15\n    *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 65 = 325\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 36 = 72\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 37 = 37\n    *   Total value of the current offer: 20 + 15 + 325 + 72 + 37 = 469.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I could propose a counteroffer. For example, offering the other player half of each item would give me [2, 1, 5, 2.5, 1.5] for myself. Calculating:\n    * 2 units of item 1: 2 * 10 = 20\n    * 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 15 = 15\n    * 5 unit of item 3: 5 * 65 = 325\n    * 2.5 unit of item 4: 2.5 * 36 = 90\n    * 1.5 unit of item 5: 1.5 * 37 = 55.5\n    * Total value = 505.5.\n   However, to determine the best counteroffer, I should consider what they offered me. They offered me [2, 1, 5, 2, 1].\n   To make a counteroffer that is very favorable to me, I would want to maximize the amount of the high value items I get - in this case item 3. I could propose a counter offer where I offer them very little.\n   For example, giving them [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] would result in me keeping [3, 2, 10, 5, 3]. This is worth:\n   * 3 units of item 1: 3 * 10 = 30\n    * 2 unit of item 2: 2 * 15 = 30\n    * 10 unit of item 3: 10 * 65 = 650\n    * 5 unit of item 4: 5 * 36 = 180\n    * 3 unit of item 5: 3 * 37 = 111\n    * Total value = 1001.\n   Another example, offering them [0,0,0,0,0] would result in me keeping all the items, for a total value of 1011.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer of 469 is less than my outside offer of 720.\n    *   The total value of the items is 1011, meaning there are potential offers that are far more valuable than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer of 720, I will not accept it. It is round 1 so I will make a counteroffer as it has the potential to offer the best value. Based on my analysis, I'd like to make a counteroffer that gives very little to Player 1, and in particular I want to secure as much of item 3 as possible. I will make a counteroffer of [0,0,0,0,0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

The value for myself of the remaining items would be:\n         * 1 item 1: 1 * 24 = 24\n         * 4 item 2: 4 * 89 = 356\n         * 4 item 3: 4 * 72 = 288\n         * 4 item 4: 4 * 90 = 360\n         * 4 item 5: 4 * 64 = 256\n         * Total: 1284\n        This is better than the outside offer.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**  The total value for all items is 1420. My outside offer of 115 is small relative to the overall value of all items. I should strive to make a deal.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   I will offer a small amount of items to player 2 to try to secure a good deal, as this is Round 1. I will offer them 1 unit of item 3 and 1 unit of item 5, keeping the rest for myself.\n\nTherefore, my action is a COUNTEROFFER of [0, 0, 1, 0, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 867. This is the guaranteed value I get if I walk away.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 55\n    *   Item 2: 23\n    *   Item 3: 43\n    *   Item 4: 79\n    *   Item 5: 78\n*   **Total Items:** There are:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   4 units of item 2\n    *   5 units of item 3\n    *   4 units of item 4\n    *   5 units of item 5\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that an agreement reached in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1, and an agreement in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times its value in round 1. Since we are in round 1 the value is not discounted, but we need to consider this if we are in round 2 and 3.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer from Player 1 is [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]. This means they are offering me:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   0 units of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   0 units of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n    \n    This leaves me with:\n    * 1 unit of item 1\n    * 4 units of item 2\n    * 4 unit of item 3\n    * 4 units of item 4\n    * 4 units of item 5\n    The value of this offer is:\n    (1 * 55) + (4 * 23) + (4 * 43) + (4 * 79) + (4 * 78) = 55 + 92 + 172 + 316 + 312 = 947\n\n    The current value of this offer is 947.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what a good counteroffer might look like. A possible counteroffer would be to demand some of the high value items.\n    Let me consider offering [0, 2, 2, 2, 2].\n    This means I keep:\n    * 1 unit of item 1\n    * 2 units of item 2\n    * 3 unit of item 3\n    * 2 units of item 4\n    * 3 units of item 5\n    The value of this is: (1 * 55) + (2 * 23) + (3 * 43) + (2 * 79) + (3 * 78) = 55 + 46 + 129 + 158 + 234 = 622. This is not good enough.\n    Let me consider offering [0, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n        This means I keep:\n    * 1 unit of item 1\n    * 3 units of item 2\n    * 4 unit of item 3\n    * 3 units of item 4\n    * 4 units of item 5\n    The value of this is: (1 * 55) + (3 * 23) + (4 * 43) + (3 * 79) + (4 * 78) = 55 + 69 + 172 + 237 + 312 = 845.\n    This is also not good enough.\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer is worth 947, which is greater than my outside offer of 867.  Since I am in the first round and so this is not discounted, it is better than my outside offer. The potential counteroffers I was considering above were worse than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 947, which is greater than my outside offer of 867.\n*   The potential counteroffers I considered were not good enough and would be worse than taking my outside offer.\n*   I should therefore ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Since it's round 1, the discount factor will be 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1.  The discount factor will influence future rounds, but is irrelevant in this turn if I am making an offer.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider offers that would be better for me than my outside offer of 1057.  Since there is no current offer, I will make an offer that gives me a value greater than 1057 and is likely to be accepted by the other player. I need to make the other player an offer that provides them with a value greater than their outside offer, which I don't know. However, a simple approach is to make an offer that gives the other player half of the total value of the items. My value of the items is:\n    *   5 units of item 1 = 5 * 56 = 280\n    *   2 units of item 2 = 2 * 47 = 94\n    *   5 units of item 3 = 5 * 7 = 35\n    *   5 units of item 4 = 5 * 82 = 410\n    *   5 units of item 5 = 5 * 84 = 420\n    *   Total value = 280 + 94 + 35 + 410 + 420 = 1239.\n    *   I will make the other player an offer to take roughly half the value by giving them:\n    *   2 unit of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n    This leaves me with:\n    *   3 units of item 1 = 3 * 56 = 168\n    *   1 units of item 2 = 1 * 47 = 47\n    *   3 units of item 3 = 3 * 7 = 21\n    *   3 units of item 4 = 3 * 82 = 246\n    *   3 units of item 5 = 3 * 84 = 252\n    *   My total value will be 168 + 47 + 21 + 246 + 252 = 734. This is not higher than my outside offer of 1057, so I must offer the other player less. Let's try offering:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   0 unit of item 2\n    *   1 units of item 3\n    *   1 units of item 4\n    *   1 units of item 5\n    This leaves me with:\n        *   4 units of item 1 = 4 * 56 = 224\n        *   2 units of item 2 = 2 * 47 = 94\n        *   4 units of item 3 = 4 * 7 = 28\n        *   4 units of item 4 = 4 * 82 = 328\n        *   4 units of item 5 = 4 * 84 = 336\n        *   Total value to me = 224 + 94 + 28 + 328 + 336 = 1010. This is still lower than my outside offer. Therefore, I must increase the number of items I keep. Let's try offering:\n        *   0 units of item 1\n        *   0 units of item 2\n        *   0 units of item 3\n        *   0 units of item 4\n        *   0 units of item 5\n       This gives me:\n        *   5 units of item 1 = 5 * 56 = 280\n        *   2 units of item 2 = 2 * 47 = 94\n        *   5 units of item 3 = 5 * 7 = 35\n        *   5 units of item 4 = 5 * 82 = 410\n        *   5 units of item 5 = 5 * 84 = 420\n        *   My total value = 280 + 94 + 35 + 410 + 420 = 1239\n       This is greater than my outside offer, and is a good starting point.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer (there is none).\n*   I should not walk away.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value but is still potentially palatable to the other player.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I need to calculate some potential values. Let's consider a few divisions where I keep more of the high value items, and offer the other player the rest.\n\n    * **Option 1: Keeping mostly high value items:**\n        Let's offer player 2:\n            * 1 unit of Item 1\n            * 1 unit of Item 2\n            * 4 unit of Item 3\n            * 3 unit of Item 4\n            * 1 unit of Item 5\n\n        That leaves me with:\n            * 2 units of Item 1: 2 * 75 = 150\n            * 3 units of Item 2: 3 * 95 = 285\n            * 4 units of Item 3: 4 * 11 = 44\n            * 3 units of Item 4: 3 * 36 = 108\n            * 1 unit of Item 5: 1 * 72 = 72\n        My total value is 150 + 285 + 44 + 108 + 72 = 659.

Accepting is not a good idea.\n*   Walking away gives me 497, which is better than accepting the current offer.\n*   Making a counteroffer gives me the possibility of a higher value, so I should try that.\n*   I should try and make a counteroffer that would result in me having more than my outside offer.\n    * Let's try for [0,0,0,0,0] for player 1 to begin with.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 763. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 867 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 1's offer in round 1 gave me [1, 0, 1, 3, 0]. If player 2 had accepted, I would have received a discounted payoff of:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 3 = 3\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 85 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 14 = 14\n    *   3 unit of item 4: 3 * 36 = 108\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 88 = 0\n    * Total value of round 1 offer: 3 + 0 + 14 + 108 + 0 = 125\n    * Discounted value of round 1 offer: 125 * 0.9 = 112.5.\n    This is very good so I will use this as the target value of a counteroffer. Therefore, I will offer player 2 the opposite of what I offered in round 1, which was [1, 0, 1, 3, 0]\n\n    A potential counteroffer for player 2 would therefore be [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    The value to me of such an offer is:\n    * 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 3 = 3\n    * 0 unit of item 2: 0 * 85 = 0\n    * 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 14 = 14\n    * 3 units of item 4: 3 * 36 = 108\n    * 0 units of item 5: 0 * 88 = 0\n    * Total value to me: 125\n    * Discounted total value: 125 * 0.9 = 112.5\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The discounted value of accepting the current offer is 47.7 which is greater than my outside offer value of 22.\n    *  The discounted value of the counteroffer is 112.5, which is far greater than my outside offer value of 22.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is better than walking away.\n*   Proposing the counteroffer is better than accepting the current offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer of [1, 2, 2, 3, 1] to player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]}\n```\n",

Since this is round 2, any outcome value will be multiplied by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 2 = 0 unit\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 6 - 3 = 3 unit\n    *   Item 5: 1 - 1 = 0 unit\n    My total value for this offer:\n    (1 * 41) + (0 * 78) + (1 * 19) + (3 * 69) + (0 * 3) = 41 + 0 + 19 + 207 + 0 = 267\n    The discounted value of accepting the current offer is 267 * 0.9 = 240.3\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is 175. The discounted value of the current offer, 240.3, is significantly higher than my outside offer.\n\n* **Potential counteroffers:**\nIt is round 2. If I do not accept I can make a counteroffer. If the other player rejects, they get their outside offer and I get mine at round 3. The value is going to be discounted. If this is round 2, the final round is 3. The discount factor will be 0.9^2 = 0.81. So my offer is valued at my offer * 0.81. I don't need to make a big counteroffer. I can see if they like a slightly better deal for them. The current offer gives player 1 [1,2,2,3,1] so I get [1,0,1,3,0]. If I offer player 1 [1,1,1,2,0] I get [1,1,2,4,1] this is a lot better for me. Let's check the value.\nMy offer [1,1,2,4,1] is worth:\n(1 * 41) + (1 * 78) + (2 * 19) + (4 * 69) + (1 * 3) = 41+78+38+276+3 = 436\nDiscounted to next round, that is 436 * 0.9 = 392.4. \nMy current offer was worth 267 * 0.9= 240.3. I can definitely ask for that.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of [1, 2, 2, 3, 1] has a discounted value of 240.3, which is better than my outside offer of 175. However, I can likely get a much better deal by counteroffering. A counteroffer [1,1,1,2,0] would get me [1,1,2,4,1] worth 436, discounted to next round is 392.4 if I have to wait another round. I will try counteroffering [1,1,1,2,0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]}\n```\n",

This means any deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its nominal value, and round 3 is worth 0.81 times the nominal value.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 1, 2, 1, 2]. Let's calculate the value to me:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 1 = 3\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 54 = 54\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 2 = 4\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 17 = 17\n    *   2 unit of item 5: 2 * 15 = 30\n    *   Total value of current offer: 3 + 54 + 4 + 17 + 30 = 108\n\n*   **Value Comparison:**\n    *   The current offer is worth 108 to me, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 51.\n   \n*  **Potential Counteroffers:** Before making a counteroffer, let's consider what I would ideally like. I highly value item 2, so I would want to keep most of that. I don't value item 1 as much, so I'm willing to give more of that away. Item 3 has low value to me. Items 4 and 5 are okay in terms of value to me.\n*   For instance, if I offer Player 1 [2,0,2,0,0], my value would be 4*1 + 3*54 + 3*2 + 3*17 + 5*15 = 4 + 162 + 6 + 51 + 75 = 298. This is a lot better than my outside option of 51.\n*    Another example: if I offered Player 1 [0,0,0,0,0], my value is 6 + 162 + 10 + 51 + 75 = 304. This is the absolute best result I can get.\n*  However, given the current offer is significantly higher than my outside offer, and this is the first round, I should probably not be too greedy.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of 108 is much better than my outside offer of 51. Therefore, it's beneficial to accept rather than walk away.\n*   Given that I have already done a lot of thinking and know that I could potentially get a lot more value from a counteroffer, it's worth exploring a counteroffer. I should not accept this offer just yet.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that is fair but still better for me than the current offer on the table, and not so extreme as to make player 1 reject it out of hand.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 382.\n*   **Item values:** My private values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 63\n    *   Item 2: 79\n    *   Item 3: 20\n    *   Item 4: 14\n    *   Item 5: 8\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*  **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since it's round 2, if a deal is reached now, the value will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. If the deal is reached at round 3, it would be multipled by 0.9^2.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer on the table is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] meaning I receive:\n    * Item 1: 1 unit\n    * Item 2: 0 units\n    * Item 3: 1 unit\n    * Item 4: 0 units\n    * Item 5: 1 unit\n    \n    This leaves me with:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit * 63 = 63\n    *   Item 2: 0 units * 79 = 0\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit * 20 = 20\n    *   Item 4: 0 units * 14 = 0\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit * 8 = 8\n    *   Total value = 63+0+20+0+8 = 91\n    The present value is 91 * 0.9 = 81.9\n    This is significantly lower than my outside offer of 382.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to think about counteroffers that are better than my current offer and also better than walking away. Let's consider what a relatively 'even' split would look like for me based on whole numbers.\n    For item 1, I'd want at least 3 given it's the most plentiful and valuable. For item 2, I want at least 1, given the value. I'd like at least 2 item 3 since it's fairly plentiful. I'd like at least one item 4 since there are 3 in total. And for item 5, I want at least 2. So, let's consider an offer where I give player 2 the remaining amounts of each item based on this target.\n        *  Item 1:  I keep 3, so I offer Player 2 3 units\n        *  Item 2: I keep 1, so I offer Player 2 2 units\n        *  Item 3: I keep 2, so I offer Player 2 3 units\n        *  Item 4: I keep 1, so I offer Player 2 2 units\n        *  Item 5: I keep 2, so I offer Player 2 3 units\n\n    So my counteroffer would be [3, 2, 3, 2, 3].\n    With this, I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 * 63 = 189\n    *   Item 2: 1 * 79 = 79\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 20 = 40\n    *   Item 4: 1 * 14 = 14\n    *   Item 5: 2 * 8 = 16\n    *  Total value = 189 + 79 + 40 + 14 + 16 = 338\n    This is lower than my outside offer of 382 and there is no discount factor because its a round 2 proposal that could be countered in round 3.\n    \n    Let's evaluate keeping a little bit more. \n     *  Item 1:  I keep 4, so I offer Player 2 2 units\n        *  Item 2: I keep 2, so I offer Player 2 1 units\n        *  Item 3: I keep 3, so I offer Player 2 2 units\n        *  Item 4: I keep 2, so I offer Player 2 1 units\n        *  Item 5: I keep 3, so I offer Player 2 2 units\n\n        My counteroffer would be [2, 1, 2, 1, 2].\n            With this, I would keep:\n        *   Item 1: 4 * 63 = 252\n        *   Item 2: 2 * 79 = 158\n        *   Item 3: 3 * 20 = 60\n        *   Item 4: 2 * 14 = 28\n        *   Item 5: 3 * 8 = 24\n        * Total value = 252 + 158 + 60 + 28 + 24 = 522\n        This is greater than my outside offer so this offer is better than walking away.\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n    The current offer is terrible. I should make a counteroffer. The offer [2, 1, 2, 1, 2] gives me a value of 522 which is better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

Let me see if I give up all of item 5, but keep everything else.\n        *   Item 1: I keep 2, value 182, give 0\n        *   Item 2: I keep 2, value 184, give 0\n        *   Item 3: I keep 0, value 0, give 0\n        *   Item 4: I keep 3, value 138, give 0\n        *   Item 5: I keep 0, value 0, give 3\n        Total: 182 + 184 + 0 + 138 + 0 = 504. This is under 516, my outside offer.\n    *  I should find a trade that gives me at least 516. Let me see if I give up all of item 5, and two of item 4, but keep everything else.\n        * Item 1: I keep 2, value 182, give 0\n        * Item 2: I keep 2, value 184, give 0\n        * Item 3: I keep 0, value 0, give 0\n        * Item 4: I keep 1, value 46, give 2\n        * Item 5: I keep 0, value 0, give 3\n        Total: 182 + 184 + 0 + 46 + 0 = 412. This is worse than my outside offer.\n    *   Let's start by offering a simple even split of items where possible: [1,1,0,1,1] giving player 2 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This would leave me with \n        *   Item 1: I keep 1, value 91\n        *   Item 2: I keep 1, value 92\n        *   Item 3: I keep 0, value 0\n        *   Item 4: I keep 2, value 92\n        *   Item 5: I keep 2, value 54\n        Total: 91+92+0+92+54 = 329.  This is below my outside offer.\n\nI want to try to give as little away as possible, but still try and get an outcome better than walking away. I will therefore start by offering a small amount to the other player. How about giving only 1 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5 to the other player, giving me a total value of 585 - 46 - 27 = 512, which is still lower than my outside option.  I will offer 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, and 1 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5 to the other player. My value is therefore 585 - 91 - 92 - 46 - 27 = 329\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince this is round 1, I don't have an offer to consider yet. My value if I accept my own offer is 329. Since this is round 1, there is no discount, the offer I am considering is not above my outside offer value. My best move is to make a counteroffer. I will offer [1, 1, 0, 1, 1] to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Let's compare to taking the whole amount, which would require giving all items to the other player. In that case, my value is 0 which is less than my outside offer value.\n    Let's also compute what I would get with a counteroffer of [0,0,0,0,0].\n    * Value from item 1: 2 * 45 = 90\n    * Value from item 2: 2 * 21 = 42\n    * Value from item 3: 0 * 14 = 0\n    * Value from item 4: 3 * 21 = 63\n    * Value from item 5: 3 * 35 = 105\n    * Total value: 90 + 42 + 0 + 63 + 105 = 300\n    \n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer is worth 122, which is greater than my outside offer of 80.\n    *   Any agreement would be preferable to my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of 122 is greater than my outside option (80), so I should not walk away.\n\nGiven that the current offer is good for me, and we are in round 1, I am going to propose a counter offer to see if I can get more value. Given that the current offer is greater than my outside option, a reasonable starting point to maximize value for myself is to propose the offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to the other player (keeping all of the items for myself). This is a risky strategy because the other player could then reject it and we proceed to round 2 with the discounting effect, but my counter offer is still higher value than my walk away option, so it is optimal.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 369. This is my guaranteed fallback if no agreement is reached.\n*   **Values of the items:**\n    *   Item 1: 75\n    *   Item 2: 71\n    *   Item 3: 71\n    *   Item 4: 29\n    *   Item 5: 4\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6\n    *   Item 2: 1\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 0\n    *   Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an agreement in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the same agreement in round 1. An agreement in round 3 is worth 0.81 (0.9 * 0.9) times the value of an agreement in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I am player 1 and it is the first round, I need to make the initial offer. I want to maximize my value while also making an offer that might be accepted by the other player. Here are a few scenarios:\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: Offer the other player half of everything:**\n        *  Item 1: 6 / 2 = 3 units\n        *  Item 2: 1 / 2 = 0.5. Since we can't give half, round down to 0 units.\n        *  Item 3: 4 / 2 = 2 units\n        *  Item 4: 0 / 2 = 0 units\n        *  Item 5: 6 / 2 = 3 units\n        * My value of this offer to the other player (player 2):\n        * Player 1 keeps: 3 units of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n        * My value is: 3*75 + 1*71 + 2*71 + 0*29 + 3*4 = 225 + 71 + 142 + 0 + 12 = 450\n\n    *   **Scenario 2: Offer the other player 1 of each item possible:**\n         *  Item 1: 1 unit\n         *  Item 2: 1 unit\n         *  Item 3: 1 unit\n         *  Item 4: 0 unit\n         *  Item 5: 1 unit\n         * Player 1 keeps: 5 units of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 5 of item 5\n         * My value: 5*75 + 0*71 + 3*71 + 0*29 + 5*4 = 375+ 0 + 213 + 0 + 20 = 608\n     * **Scenario 3: Try to take most items for myself, but offer some to the other player:**\n        * Offer player 2: 1 unit of Item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n        * Player 1 keeps: 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n        * My value: 5*75 + 1*71 + 3*71 + 0*29 + 5*4 = 375 + 71 + 213 + 0 + 20 = 679\n    \n    * **Scenario 4: Be very generous to try to secure a quick deal.** Offer player 2 2 of each unit of items they can have.\n        * Offer player 2: 2 units of Item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n        * Player 1 keeps: 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n        * My value: 4*75 + 1*71 + 2*71 + 0*29 + 4*4 = 300+ 71 + 142+0+16 = 529\n    *   All of these values are greater than 369.\n* **Comparison to outside offer:** The value of all of these offers to me is higher than my outside offer of 369, so it is best for me to make an offer and not walk away at this time. Since it is the first round, there is no cost to me to make a counteroffer of more than my outside offer. The offer in Scenario 3 gives me the highest value of the scenarios considered.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept any current offer, since there is no offer.\n*   I should not walk away, as there are counteroffers I can make that are better than my outside option.\n*   I should make a counteroffer. I am going to use the offer in Scenario 3.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Since this is round 1, any accepted offer will be multiplied by 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1. This means there is no discount at this stage. Future rounds will have a discount factor.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I'm Player 1 and it's the first round, I need to propose an offer. My goal is to maximize my value, but I should also consider what Player 2 might accept. I want to get a value greater than 621. It doesn't make sense to offer player 2 more than the entire supply of items, so that's a constraint. I can assume the other player will be rational, and won't accept an offer below their outside offer. In the absence of any knowledge about what their outside offer is, I will make an offer that gives me most of the value. Lets try offering the other player one of each item, which I expect will be easily above 621.\n     *   Offer to Player 2: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n     *   My remaining items: [3, 4, 2, 1, 4]\n     *   My value from remaining items: (3 * 97) + (4 * 8) + (2 * 100) + (1 * 20) + (4 * 13) = 291 + 32 + 200 + 20 + 52 = 595. This is less than my outside offer.\n     *   Let's try offering 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 0 of item 5.\n        *   Offer to Player 2: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n        *   My remaining items: [4, 4, 3, 2, 5]\n        *   My value from remaining items: (4 * 97) + (4 * 8) + (3 * 100) + (2 * 20) + (5 * 13) = 388 + 32 + 300 + 40 + 65 = 825\n         *  This is greater than my outside offer, so this is a good candidate to try.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will propose a counteroffer because I can achieve a value greater than my outside option.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1018. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 786 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1018\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 64\n    *   Item 2: 64\n    *   Item 3: 27\n    *   Item 4: 54\n    *   Item 5: 53\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4\n    *   Item 2: 10\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 4\n    *   Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor influence:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. Since this is round 1, the discount factor does not come into play. My immediate value of the negotiation should be compared with my outside offer value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   My total value of all items is calculated as follows:\n         * 4 * 64 = 256\n         * 10 * 64 = 640\n         * 3 * 27 = 81\n         * 4 * 54 = 216\n         * 3 * 53 = 159\n        * Total: 256+640+81+216+159 = 1352\n        I should try to get the best deal possible (as much of the value as possible), but never less than my outside offer of 1018.\n    *   I need to propose a counteroffer that keeps a large portion of the total value for myself. Let's aim for something that leaves me with at least 80% of the total value.\n    *   To ensure that I do not walk away from negotiations, I should make an offer that guarantees that I receive more than my outside value.\n    *   If the other player accepts a counteroffer, I will receive (in the first round) full value of my offer. If I don't make a counteroffer, and a counteroffer from the other player comes in in the second round and I accept it, I will only receive a value multiplied by gamma, so I should make a counteroffer that aims to get me close to my total value.\n    *   To start, I'll propose a counteroffer where I keep most of the items, offering the other player a small portion. I will offer them 1 unit of item 2, so I keep 4 units of item 1, 9 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4 and 3 of item 5.\n\n    Let's calculate my value from this potential counteroffer:\n       *  Item 1: 4 * 64 = 256\n       *  Item 2: 9 * 64 = 576\n       *  Item 3: 3 * 27 = 81\n       *  Item 4: 4 * 54 = 216\n       *  Item 5: 3 * 53 = 159\n        * Total: 256 + 576 + 81 + 216 + 159= 1288\n    This is greater than my outside offer, which means that this is a viable counteroffer.\n    *   If I offer the other player [0,1,0,0,0] my value is 1288. If I offer them 1 each of all of the items, the offer to player 2 would be [1,1,1,1,1], my value would be 256+576+81+216+159 = 1288. \n    The value of my offer is well over my outside value.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n    Since I do not have a current offer, I should make a counteroffer. I will offer the other player 1 of item 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Since I want to maximize my value, I will focus on maximizing the amount of items I keep. A good strategy would be to consider giving player 1 just enough items that they might accept. I should also be wary of giving player 1 too much value and should be wary that they may have a good outside offer.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** I want to get a value of at least 932 in the negotiation, or else I will walk away.

Since I have 2 more rounds to negotiate, I think I should propose this counteroffer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 932.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values are 63 for item 1, 44 for item 2, 36 for item 3, 84 for item 4, and 43 for item 5.\n*   **Total Pool of Items:** There are 4 units of item 1, 10 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. Since this is round 2, any deal made now will be multiplied by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I receive 0 units of each item. The value to me if I accept this is 0.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's calculate the value of keeping all of the items for myself (which is what a counteroffer [0,0,0,0,0] would mean for me):\n    *   4 units of item 1: 4 * 63 = 252\n    *   10 units of item 2: 10 * 44 = 440\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 36 = 108\n    *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 84 = 336\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 43 = 129\n    *   Total value: 252 + 440 + 108 + 336 + 129 = 1265\n    \n    The discounted value of this outcome for me would be 1265 * 0.9 = 1138.5.\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** Accepting the current offer [0,0,0,0,0] has a value of 0. If the game ends in this round with me getting all the items and player 1 getting none the value would be 1138.5, while my outside offer has a value of 932. Given this is round two, I should make a counter offer as my outside offer is higher than my value with a zero offer. \n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is worth 0 to me.\n*   My outside offer is worth 932, so walking away is better than accepting the current offer.\n*   It is round 2, and I should try to get more than my outside option value through a counteroffer.\n*   Given that player 1 has offered me nothing twice, I should offer a counteroffer that is generous, but still above my outside offer when discounted.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer where I get slightly more than half of the items, while still ensuring that I am well above my outside offer. I will give player 1:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (keeping 3 for myself)\n- 5 units of item 2 (keeping 5 for myself)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 2 for myself)\n- 2 unit of item 4 (keeping 2 for myself)\n- 1 units of item 5 (keeping 2 for myself)\nThis means my offer to Player 1 is [1, 5, 1, 2, 1]\n\nMy value calculation for this would be:\n-3 * 63 = 189\n-5 * 44 = 220\n-2 * 36 = 72\n-2 * 84 = 168\n-2 * 43 = 86\nTotal value = 189 + 220 + 72 + 168 + 86 = 735. Discounted value would be 735 * 0.9 = 661.5. Given this is lower than my outside offer, I should not make this counter offer, and should instead keep everything I can for myself. My counteroffer will therefore be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine my best course of action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 347\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 69, Item 2: 24, Item 3: 15, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 34\n*   **Total items:** 3 units of item 1, 9 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value of a deal in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 5, 3, 2, 2].  This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 9 - 5 = 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n\n    The total value to me of this offer is:\n    (2 * 69) + (4 * 24) + (2 * 15) + (1 * 1) + (2 * 34) = 138 + 96 + 30 + 1 + 68 = 333\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 333, while my outside offer is 347. Since 333 is less than 347, accepting the current offer is not in my best interest.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to propose an offer that gives me a total value greater than my outside option of 347. Given that Player 1 offered a relatively low amount, it is advantageous to request more items of high value. Let's calculate a potential counteroffer and then compare it to my outside offer. It is risky to walk away in the first round, as there are several rounds left to come to an agreement.\n\n    Let's try a counteroffer where I get 2 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 of item 5:\n    (2 * 69) + (6 * 24) + (3 * 15) + (1 * 1) + (3 * 34) = 138 + 144 + 45 + 1 + 102 = 430. This sounds like a good target.  This corresponds to offering player 1 the rest of the items: item 1:1, item 2:3, item 3:2, item 4:2 and item 5:1 which is [1,3,2,2,1]\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   A counteroffer of [1, 3, 2, 2, 1] would give me value of 430, which is significantly greater than my outside offer of 347.\n*   It is unlikely I will get a better offer than my calculated counteroffer above.\n*   Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer to player 1.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 2, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

After discounting by gamma, this will be 475 * 0.9 = 427.5\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** To formulate a counteroffer, I want to figure out what I would be happy to take, and if there is anything Player 2 has been offering that I don't value as much. Player 2 offered me [1, 3, 2, 2, 1] last round. They seem to want some of everything, but have been offering me less of the high value items. I have a strong preference for items 3 and 4. I want to get more than half of these.  Let's evaluate a possible counteroffer where I take at least 2 of the high value items.

Given that, I will make a counteroffer that gives me a slightly better value than the outside offer of 347. I should attempt to get more of the higher value items.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 239\n*   **My item values:** \n    *   Item 1: 46\n    *   Item 2: 14\n    *   Item 3: 81\n    *   Item 4: 93\n    *   Item 5: 39\n*   **Total pool of items:** \n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 9\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 3, the discount factor will be 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 0].\n    *   My value for this offer: (0 * 46) + (2 * 14) + (0 * 81) + (1 * 93) + (0 * 39) = 0 + 28 + 0 + 93 + 0 = 121\n    *   Discounted value of accepting this offer: 121 * 0.81 = 98.01\n    * This is well below my outside offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since it is the last round, we are restricted to making a final offer that they will be forced to accept (treated as a walk if they counter). If I make a counteroffer and they accept, the discount factor is 0.81. We will look at how we can maximize our final discounted value.\n    * To get the maximum value for myself I need to keep as much of the goods as possible. If I offer them nothing they will walk and my value will be 239.\n    \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer has a discounted value of 98.01, which is much less than my outside offer of 239. Since it is the last round, any counteroffer I make will be treated as a walk if they counter, therefore any counteroffer that is better than 239 for me should be explored. If I offer player 2 all the items, my value is zero (and so they get all the value, discounted). So my best option is to make a counteroffer that gives nothing to Player 2 so that they walk. My total value is 0 if I offer all the items to the other player, and 239 if I walk. If I offer the other player any items then my value will be less than the total value of my items so it makes sense to offer them nothing (as they will walk in response) and take my walk away value. If I give the other player the current offer amount they will accept and I get the 98.01 value. Therefore, I should walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

It makes sense for me to try to keep more of items I value more. Since I have more items available, a potentially good strategy is to give away what I value less. If I were to give the other player [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] this would give me the maximum value which is 6 * 98 + 2 * 87 + 5 * 53 + 7 * 81 + 8 * 98 = 588 + 174 + 265 + 567 + 784 = 2378.

I also need to beat my outside offer.\n*  **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer gives me a value of 1469, which is greater than my outside offer of 1170. However, we are still in round 1 so I should aim to achieve better than this.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is better than my outside offer, but it is only the first round and I can get more value by counteroffering.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer that increases my value.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 403\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 99\n    *   Item 2: 39\n    *   Item 3: 60\n    *   Item 4: 39\n    *   Item 5: 51\n*   **Total item pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 6 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 7 units\n    *   Item 5: 8 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of a deal in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 3, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit * 99 = 99\n    *   Item 2: 0 units * 39 = 0\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit * 60 = 60\n    *   Item 4: 3 units * 39 = 117\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit * 51 = 51\n    *   Total value of current offer = 99 + 0 + 60 + 117 + 51 = 327\n\n    This offer has a value of 327 to me. However, it is round 2, so the discounted value is 327 * 0.9^(2-1) = 327 * 0.9 = 294.3\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    *   I need to calculate what I would receive for each possible counteroffer given the total amounts available of each item. Remember that anything I offer to Player 2, I won't be able to keep.\n    *   The other player is clearly trying to get a larger portion of items 2 and 4 since they're only offering 0 and 3 respectively, while I value both items 39 a unit.\n    *   Let's look at the previous round and consider what I offered the player and what they counteroffered me.\n    *   Round 1 - I offered [1,2,1,6,1]. They offered me [1,0,1,3,1]. It seems there is a large disagreement on items 2 and 4.\n    *   Considering the need to get the best offer for myself, I will consider two offers:\n        *   **Counteroffer 1:** Offer the other player [1, 1, 1, 2, 1].  This would mean I keep 5 of item 1 (5 x 99= 495), 1 of item 2 (39), 4 of item 3 (240), 5 of item 4 (195), and 7 of item 5 (357). That would be 495 + 39 + 240 + 195 + 357 = 1326.\n        *   **Counteroffer 2:** Offer the other player [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This would mean I keep 5 of item 1 (5 x 99 = 495), 2 of item 2 (78), 4 of item 3 (240), 6 of item 4 (234), and 7 of item 5 (357). That would be 495 + 78 + 240 + 234 + 357 = 1404\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer (294.3) is less than my outside offer (403).\n    *   Counteroffer 1 (1326 discounted by 0.9 to be 1193.4) and Counteroffer 2 (1404 discounted by 0.9 to be 1263.6) are both much greater than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth less than my outside offer, therefore I will not accept.\n*   I would get a far better value for counteroffer 2. This offer would be worth 1263.6 (not yet discounted), therefore I should make counteroffer 2 which I have computed as [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. I should do this now as to not get a lower payout at a later round.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Let's offer Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 2, 2] This would mean that I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n\n    My value for the potential counteroffer:\n     *   Item 1: 5 * 98 = 490\n    *   Item 2: 2 * 87 = 174\n    *   Item 3: 4 * 53 = 212\n    *   Item 4: 5 * 81 = 405\n    *   Item 5: 6 * 98 = 588\n    *   Total: 490 + 174 + 212 + 405 + 588 = 1869\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n     * The current offer, if accepted, will yield a discounted value of 1843.2, this is much better than my outside offer of 1170\n     * The potential counteroffer is worth 1869 to me, this might be a slightly better deal, but there is still a round to go. If the next round is reached, and the other player accepts my counteroffer, I get this discounted by 0.9^2. I need to determine if its worth risking the negotiation over the current offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is already very good at 1843.2. I am guaranteed 1170 if I walk, so the current offer is significantly better. Trying to improve it with a counteroffer might risk walking away without a deal, especially as we are in round 2, and if I offer a counteroffer in round 3, this is treated as a walk. The value of the counteroffer after the discount factor would be 1869 * 0.81 = 1513.89 which is better, but I must gamble on the other player accepting. I will take the guarantee and ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This would mean I keep 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 2 of item 5.\n    Value: 3 * 19 + 5 * 28 + 3 * 98 + 2 * 79 + 2 * 72 = 57 + 140 + 294 + 158 + 144 = 793.\n    Let's try offering 1 unit of each item to Player 2.\n    Value: 3 * 19 + 5 * 28 + 3 * 98 + 1 * 79 + 1 * 72 = 57 + 140 + 294 + 79 + 72 = 642\n    Let's offer 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n    Value: 4*19 + 6*28 + 3*98 + 2*79 + 2*72 = 76 + 168 + 294 + 158 + 144 = 840\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will propose the counteroffer that leaves me with a value above my outside offer. Offering 1 of each item to Player 2, except for items 4 and 5 which I'll keep for myself. This will result in me keeping 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 2 of item 5.\nThis value was 793.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times as much as a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times as much as a deal in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 0].

I value items 2 and 3 the most.\n\n    I would want to make a counter offer that gives me more value. Since we are in round 1, and my current offer is 144, and the outside offer is 233. I am in a position to propose a more valuable offer that gets me close to the full value of the goods. I will prioritize the items I value most. I will make a counteroffer that gives player 1 one of the item types I value least and takes most of the remaining item types.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer of 144 is less than my outside offer of 233.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer (144) is significantly less than my outside offer (233).\n*   I am not willing to accept this offer.\n*   I should try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n*  A counteroffer of [3, 5, 3, 1, 1] would give me 1 unit of item 1 (6), 1 unit of item 2 (86), 1 unit of item 3 (52), 1 unit of item 4 (19) and 1 unit of item 5 (25). Total value is 6+86+52+19+25=188 for this counter offer, for a total value of 836-188 = 648\nThis means a counter offer of [1,1,1,1,1] would give Player 1 1*6 + 1*86+ 1*52+ 1*19 + 1*25 = 188, leaving me with 836-188 = 648.\nThe best offer I can reasonably expect is keeping most of item 2 and item 3, which are high value to me and offering lower value items to the other player.\nA counter offer of [1,1,1,1,1] is too generous, however offering a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] would almost certainly be rejected.\nI will go for [1, 2, 1, 0, 0].

I will try giving player 2 only 1 of each unit that is greater than 0.\n     * Player 2 gets:\n         * Item 1: 1\n         * Item 2: 1\n         * Item 3: 1\n         * Item 4: 1\n         * Item 5: 0\n     * I get:\n        * Item 1: 3\n        * Item 2: 3\n        * Item 3: 1\n        * Item 4: 3\n        * Item 5: 0\n    My value with this offer:\n     *   Item 1: 3 * 73 = 219\n    *   Item 2: 3 * 69 = 207\n    *   Item 3: 1 * 21 = 21\n    *   Item 4: 3 * 82 = 246\n    *   Item 5: 0 * 29 = 0\n    *   Total value: 219 + 207 + 21 + 246 + 0 = 693\n    This is less than my walk away value.\n\n    I will try giving player 2 1 unit of the items where I have the highest value.\n     * Player 2 gets:\n         * Item 1: 1\n         * Item 2: 0\n         * Item 3: 0\n         * Item 4: 1\n         * Item 5: 0\n     * I get:\n         * Item 1: 3\n         * Item 2: 4\n         * Item 3: 2\n         * Item 4: 3\n         * Item 5: 0\n\n    My value with this offer:\n     *   Item 1: 3 * 73 = 219\n    *   Item 2: 4 * 69 = 276\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 21 = 42\n    *   Item 4: 3 * 82 = 246\n    *   Item 5: 0 * 29 = 0\n    *   Total value: 219+276+42+246 = 783\n\n   This is still less than my walk away value. I should be aiming for a total value above my walk away value.\n    I should offer to give Player 2 just 1 unit of my best item, and see what they respond.\n\n        * Player 2 gets:\n            * Item 1: 0\n            * Item 2: 0\n            * Item 3: 0\n            * Item 4: 1\n            * Item 5: 0\n         *  I get:\n            * Item 1: 4\n            * Item 2: 4\n            * Item 3: 2\n            * Item 4: 3\n            * Item 5: 0\n\n    My value with this offer:\n    *   Item 1: 4 * 73 = 292\n    *   Item 2: 4 * 69 = 276\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 21 = 42\n    *   Item 4: 3 * 82 = 246\n    *   Item 5: 0 * 29 = 0\n    *   Total value: 856.\n    This is less than my walk away value if discounted in the next round.\n    I will go with offering 1 unit of item 4, which has the highest value for me. This would still allow for the potential of a larger deal.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will propose a counteroffer to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

Since it's round 1, the discount factor is not currently relevant, but it will be in future rounds.\n    Let's calculate the total value I would receive if I gave Player 1 nothing and kept everything myself.\n    My total value = (4 * 66) + (4 * 88) + (2 * 68) + (4 * 72) + (0 * 18) = 264 + 352 + 136 + 288 + 0 = 1040\n    This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's consider the extreme case of me proposing to Player 1 that I take 0 units of each item (offering all units to Player 1) . That would give me a value of 0 (much lower than the outside offer).\n\n    If I gave Player 1 half the items where possible, that would be an offer of [2,2,1,2,0].\n    My value would be: \n    (2 * 66) + (2 * 88) + (1 * 68) + (2 * 72) + (0 * 18) = 132 + 176 + 68 + 144 = 520\n    This is still less than my outside offer.\n\n    Based on this analysis, I will propose a counteroffer that gives me most of the value.\n   \n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nGiven that the current offer is terrible, my outside offer is good, and it's the first round, I will make a counteroffer that gets me a good value. I'll propose a counteroffer that gives Player 1 very little. For example, offering Player 1 [1, 1, 0, 1, 0].\n\nMy value would be:\n(3*66) + (3*88) + (2*68) + (3*72) + (0*18) = 198 + 264 + 136 + 216 + 0 = 814.\nThis is less than my outside offer, so this is not optimal.\nLet's consider an offer of [0,0,0,0,0].

I will think about a counteroffer which maximizes the value I get for the given items. Since I value item 4 the most and the other player offered me one unit of item 4 and then 0 after that, it may be possible to get an advantage here.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 951.\n*   **Item values:** My values are 66 for item 1, 88 for item 2, 68 for item 3, 72 for item 4, and 18 for item 5.\n*   **Total pool of items:** There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], meaning Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 2.\n    *   My value for this offer is: (1 * 66) + (1 * 88) + (0 * 68) + (0 * 72) + (0 * 18) = 154\n    *   My discounted value for accepting the current offer in round 2: 154 * 0.9 = 138.6\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to consider my value if I make a counteroffer. I want to aim for a value exceeding my discounted outside offer of 951 * 0.9 = 855.9. Let's analyze a potential offer where I get the majority of the items. \nLet's consider an offer where I keep 3 items of item 1, 3 items of item 2, 2 items of item 3, 3 items of item 4 and 0 items of item 5. This means my counteroffer will be [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n    *   My value for this outcome would be: (3 * 66) + (3 * 88) + (2 * 68) + (3 * 72) + (0 * 18) = 198 + 264 + 136 + 216 + 0 = 814\n    *   This total value is less than my outside offer and therefore not good enough.\nSince we are in round 2 and if a counteroffer fails in the final round, we get our outside offer value I should aim for the maximum possible value.\nLet's consider an offer where I keep all items: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This implies the counteroffer would be [4, 4, 2, 4, 0].\n    *   My value for this outcome would be: (4 * 66) + (4 * 88) + (2 * 68) + (4 * 72) + (0 * 18) = 264 + 352 + 136 + 288 + 0 = 1040\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of accepting the current offer is 138.6. This is much lower than my outside offer value of 951.\nMy potential counteroffer where I keep all the items gives me a value of 1040, which is higher than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe discounted value of accepting the current offer (138.6) is less than the value of my outside offer (951). Therefore, accepting is not optimal.\nA counteroffer where I keep all the items would give me a value of 1040, which is greater than my outside offer. This would maximize my value in this negotiation.\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer where I keep everything for myself.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 4, 2, 4, 0]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 357. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 540 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 357.\n*   **Item values:** My values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 86\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 7\n    *   Item 4: 66\n    *   Item 5: 19\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*  **Discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't affect value this round\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer gives me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I get 1 unit of each item. My value from the offer is:\n    *   1 * 86 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 7 + 1 * 66 + 1 * 19 = 86 + 2 + 7 + 66 + 19 = 180\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer where I try to get as much of the valuable items (1 and 4) as possible. If I were to offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I keep everything, my value would be:\n    *  4*86 + 3*2 + 4*7 + 3*66 + 5*19 = 344 + 6 + 28 + 198 + 95 = 671\n    If I were to offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] , my value would be 180 as calculated above.  A slightly less aggressive offer of [1,0,1,0,1] for player 1 would give me [3,3,3,3,4] yielding 3*86+3*2+3*7+3*66+4*19=258+6+21+198+76=559.\n     If I offer player 1 [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] I get [4,2,4,2,5]. The total value for me is: 4*86+2*2+4*7+2*66+5*19=344+4+28+132+95 = 603\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer of 180 is less than my outside offer of 357. The counteroffer where I keep everything is far more valuable at 671, and other offers such as offering player 1 [1,0,1,0,1] are still more than the outside offer and the current offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of 180 is less than my outside offer of 357, so I should not accept.\n*   I should not walk, as there are offers I can make that are better than my outside offer.\n*   I should make a counteroffer.  Offering [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] is a good start, giving me 559. Given we are in round one, I will make the counteroffer of [0,1,0,1,0]. I am being slightly more aggressive, keeping more high-value items, yielding 603.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 24) + (1 * 20) + (0 * 18) + (1 * 37) + (0 * 22) = 20 + 37 = 57.\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 57 * 0.9 = 51.3\n    *   This value is much lower than my outside offer value of 378.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine what counteroffer to make to maximize my utility.  I will aim for a counteroffer that will provide me with a discounted value above my outside offer value. Let's see what we can calculate and evaluate a specific potential counteroffer. For now, let's evaluate a counteroffer of giving the other player 1 unit of each item.\n    *   If I offer Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], this means I keep 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of this counteroffer to me: (3 * 24) + (2 * 20) + (3 * 18) + (2 * 37) + (4 * 22) = 72 + 40 + 54 + 74 + 88 = 328\n    *  Discounted value of this counteroffer: 328 * 0.9 = 295.2\n     * This value is below my outside offer and since it is round 2, I should be aiming to get a value above my outside offer of 378 * 0.9 = 340.2. Since I am not sure what the other player's values are, I'll be aiming to maximise my offer. Let's try a counteroffer of giving the other player only one unit of item 1, and 1 unit of item 3 to see if this will work.\n\n   *   If I offer Player 2 [1, 0, 1, 0, 0], this means I keep 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of this counteroffer to me: (3 * 24) + (3 * 20) + (3 * 18) + (3 * 37) + (5 * 22) = 72 + 60 + 54 + 111 + 110 = 407\n    *  Discounted value of this counteroffer: 407 * 0.9 = 366.3\n    * This is much better, but still not significantly above the outside offer. It also represents a rather aggressive proposal, so let's make it slightly more palatable to the other player to increase the chances of a deal.\n    * If I offer Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 0, 0], this means I keep 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of this counteroffer to me: (3 * 24) + (2 * 20) + (3 * 18) + (3 * 37) + (5 * 22) = 72 + 40 + 54 + 111 + 110 = 387\n    *  Discounted value of this counteroffer: 387 * 0.9 = 348.3\n    * This is still above my target. Let's see if offering a little more makes sense to secure a deal now.\n       * If I offer Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], this means I keep 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of this counteroffer to me: (3 * 24) + (2 * 20) + (3 * 18) + (2 * 37) + (5 * 22) = 72 + 40 + 54 + 74 + 110 = 350\n    *  Discounted value of this counteroffer: 350 * 0.9 = 315\n    * This would mean a loss compared to my outside option so is not good.\n*  **Comparison to outside offer:** It is very clear that the current offer is worse than my outside offer. The counter offer of [1,1,1,0,0] has a discounted value higher than the target discounted value of my outside offer.\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] has a very low value compared to my outside offer.\n*   Walking away would guarantee my outside offer of 378\n*   I have found a counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 0, 0] which would lead to a discounted total value of 348.3 which is slightly better than the discounted value of my outside offer 378 * 0.9 = 340.2.

This means I get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 28 = 28\n    *   1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 98 = 98\n    *   0 units of item 3 = 0 * 55 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 4 = 0 * 46 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 31 = 31\n    *   Total value of current offer = 28 + 98 + 0 + 0 + 31 = 157\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to compare my value from potential counteroffers with my outside offer, discounted by the round. The value of the current offer is 157, and my outside offer is 924.  It is clear I will not be accepting this current offer, given its terrible value. I'll consider a counter offer that is favorable to me, and that I believe Player 1 might accept, and compare it to my discounted outside offer in later rounds if it is rejected.\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I offer player 1 roughly half of each item (rounding down where needed).  This means I offer them [4, 3, 1, 1, 3]\n        * I keep 5 units of item 1 = 5 * 28 = 140\n        * I keep 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 98 = 294\n        * I keep 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 55 = 110\n        * I keep 1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 46 = 46\n        * I keep 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 31 = 93\n        * Total Value = 140 + 294 + 110 + 46 + 93 = 683\n\n    If we counter with [4,3,1,1,3] this has a value of 683. This is less than my outside offer of 924, so I must keep my expected value from the negotiation above this. Therefore, I will try to extract the maximum value.\n\n    Let's calculate the value if I give the other player only 1 of each item they desire the least (as well as zero of what I desire), and keep the rest. This means I'd give them [1,0,0,1,1], keeping [8,6,3,1,5].\n     * 8 units of item 1 = 8 * 28 = 224\n    * 6 units of item 2 = 6 * 98 = 588\n    * 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 55 = 165\n    * 1 units of item 4 = 1 * 46 = 46\n    * 5 units of item 5 = 5 * 31 = 155\n    * Total Value = 224 + 588 + 165 + 46 + 155 = 1178\n\n    Let's offer the other player a minimum set of items [1,0,0,0,1].\n    * I keep 8 units of item 1 = 8 * 28 = 224\n    * I keep 6 units of item 2 = 6 * 98 = 588\n    * I keep 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 55 = 165\n    * I keep 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 46 = 92\n    * I keep 5 units of item 5 = 5 * 31 = 155\n    * Total value = 224 + 588 + 165 + 92 + 155 = 1224\n\n    Since this value is higher than my outside offer, it is a good counteroffer to make.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is very low (157) compared to my outside offer (924).\n*   A counteroffer of [1,0,0,0,1] yields me a total value of 1224, which is better than my outside offer, and should be considered as a counteroffer.\n*  Since the game has not concluded and I have not met my max number of rounds, I will make a counteroffer to try and secure a deal higher than my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 810\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 42\n    *   Item 2: 5\n    *   Item 3: 69\n    *   Item 4: 87\n    *   Item 5: 44\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 9 units\n    *   Item 2: 6 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9 if we accept in this round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I would get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 42 = 42\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 5 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 69 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 87 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 44 = 44\n    *   Total value of the current offer: 42 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 44 = 86\n    *   Discounted value of the current offer: 86 * 0.9 = 77.4\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine what counteroffer I should make to maximize my value. I need to keep in mind the discount factor and my outside offer value. Since round 2 is not the last round, I may want to make a reasonable counteroffer. Let's try to calculate what would be a good offer. \n    I can offer a counteroffer of the reverse of what the other player is offering -  [8, 6, 3, 2, 5] this gives me:\n        *   8 units of item 1: 8 * 42 = 336\n        *   6 units of item 2: 6 * 5 = 30\n        *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 69 = 207\n        *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 87 = 174\n        *   5 units of item 5: 5 * 44 = 220\n        *   Total value of this offer to me: 336+30+207+174+220 = 967\n        * Discounted value in the next round: 967 * 0.9 = 870.3 (I will get this in the next round if player 2 accepts, which is better than my outside offer, but unlikely. \n    Let's try a slightly more reasonable offer for me of [4, 3, 1, 1, 3]:\n        * 4 units of item 1: 4 * 42 = 168\n        * 3 units of item 2: 3 * 5 = 15\n        * 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 69 = 69\n        * 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 87 = 87\n        * 3 units of item 5: 3 * 44 = 132\n        * Total value = 168+15+69+87+132 = 471\n    My outside offer value is 810.  It is best to make an offer that will be more beneficial than walking away, but not so extreme that it is not accepted.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer value of 77.4 is significantly lower than my outside offer of 810.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is not acceptable, as it gives me a value of 77.4, much lower than my outside offer of 810.\n*   Walking away is a safe option since my outside offer is 810.\n*   A counteroffer is best since I'm not in the final round, but should not be too unreasonable or it will not be accepted. I should propose a counteroffer that is better than the outside offer if it is accepted and not something that will make the player walk away.  A counter offer of [4, 3, 1, 1, 3] giving the other player half the items is a good starting point. \n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 3, 1, 1, 3]}\n```\n",

A possible counteroffer would be to give them: [1,1,0,0,1]\n    This means I keep:\n        * 8 units of item 1: 8 * 28 = 224\n        * 5 units of item 2: 5 * 98 = 490\n        * 3 units of item 3: 3 * 55 = 165\n        * 2 units of item 4: 2 * 46 = 92\n        * 5 units of item 5: 5 * 31 = 155\n        * Total Value: 1126\n        * Discounted value = 1126 * 0.9^1 = 1013.4\n\n    Let's also consider a \"fair\" offer, where we split more evenly. For example: [4,3,1,1,3].\n    This would mean I keep:\n        * 5 units of item 1: 5 * 28 = 140\n        * 3 units of item 2: 3 * 98 = 294\n        * 2 units of item 3: 2 * 55 = 110\n        * 1 units of item 4: 1 * 46 = 46\n        * 3 units of item 5: 3 * 31 = 93\n        * Total Value: 683\n        * Discounted value = 683 * 0.9^1 = 614.7\n    \n     The current offer gives me a discounted value of 540.\n    My outside offer value is 924.\n    Any potential counteroffer will only be valuable if it provides me with more than 924 discounted.\n    Therefore the [1,1,0,0,1] offer is good.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n* The current offer's discounted value is 540. This is less than my outside offer of 924.\n* I should make a counter offer as [1,1,0,0,1] since this will give me a higher value, with a discounted value of 1013.4 if it is accepted next round.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 247. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 648 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 247\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 37\n    *   Item 2: 5\n    *   Item 3: 47\n    *   Item 4: 66\n    *   Item 5: 61\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. The discount factor will affect the present value of any offers in later rounds: each round will reduce the value by the discount factor.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table, which means there is nothing to accept yet.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   I need to propose an offer where I retain enough items to achieve a total value of greater than my outside offer, considering the possibility of future discounted offers if my current offer is rejected.\n\n    Let's consider a few possible counteroffers, focusing on giving more of the lower-value items to Player 2, while still retaining more of the items that I highly value:\n    *   **Offer 1:**  Give Player 2: [1, 1, 0, 0, 1] (1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5)\n        *   This would leave me with: [2, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n        *   My Value: (2 * 37) + (1 * 5) + (2 * 47) + (2 * 66) + (3 * 61) = 74 + 5 + 94 + 132 + 183 = 488\n    *   **Offer 2:** Give Player 2: [1, 2, 0, 0, 0] (1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5)\n        *   This would leave me with: [2, 0, 2, 2, 4]\n        *   My Value: (2 * 37) + (0 * 5) + (2 * 47) + (2 * 66) + (4 * 61) = 74 + 0 + 94 + 132 + 244 = 544\n    *   **Offer 3:** Give Player 2: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] (0 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 unit of item 5)\n        *   This would leave me with: [3, 2, 1, 1, 4]\n        *   My Value: (3 * 37) + (2 * 5) + (1 * 47) + (1 * 66) + (4 * 61) = 111 + 10 + 47 + 66 + 244 = 478\n\n    *   **Analysis:** Offer 2 looks good in terms of my value, as my value is 544 > 247, and gives more of the less valuable items (item 2) to player 2 while retaining most of the more valuable items. This is a good balance to start with to try and capture some of the surplus from trade. The other offers do not give as great of a value to me.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince it's the first round, I should make a counteroffer to start the negotiation. Offer 2 seems to be the best at the moment as it maximizes my value while still offering items to the other player.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 538\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 35 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 94 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 39 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 11 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 92 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 35 = 35\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 94 = 188\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 39 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 11 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 92 = 0\n    *   **Total value of current offer:** 35 + 188 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 223.\n    *   Since this is round 1, the discounted value is 223 * 0.9^(1-1) = 223 * 1 = 223\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (223) is significantly less than my outside offer (538). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a bad choice.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate the value to me if I make a counteroffer. I want to try to get as much value as possible while still making sure Player 1 might accept. I need to keep in mind that if I give Player 1 more in my counteroffer, I receive less. A naive approach would be to offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which would give me the full item values, but this would almost certainly be rejected and result in the value of my outside offer. A reasonable approach might be to try for 1 unit each of item 1-4 and 2 units of item 5. This means I would receive:\n\n    * 2 units of item 1: 2 * 35 = 70\n    * 0 units of item 2: 0 * 94 = 0\n    * 2 units of item 3: 2 * 39 = 78\n    * 2 units of item 4: 2 * 11 = 22\n    * 2 units of item 5: 2 * 92 = 184\n    * Total value: 70 + 0 + 78 + 22 + 184 = 354.\n\n     If I offered 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5, I would receive:\n\n    * 2 units of item 1: 2 * 35 = 70\n    * 1 units of item 2: 1 * 94 = 94\n    * 1 units of item 3: 1 * 39 = 39\n    * 1 units of item 4: 1 * 11 = 11\n    * 2 units of item 5: 2 * 92 = 184\n    * Total value: 70 + 94 + 39 + 11 + 184 = 398\n\nAnother strategy could be to offer player 1 only items of low value for me. For example, an offer of [1, 0, 1, 1, 2] would mean I receive:\n    *   2 unit of item 1: 2 * 35 = 70\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 94 = 188\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 39 = 39\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 11 = 11\n    *   2 unit of item 5: 2 * 92 = 184\n    *   Total value: 70 + 188 + 39 + 11 + 184 = 492\n\nOffering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is likely to lead to walking away, but offering [1,0,1,1,2] might be too much for Player 1. I will try offering [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means I receive:\n\n* 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 35 = 70\n* 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 94 = 188\n* 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 39 = 78\n* 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 11 = 22\n* 4 units of item 5 = 4 * 92 = 368\n* Total value = 726\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is bad. My outside offer is much better than accepting the current offer. My best counteroffer, given that we're only in round 1, would be to offer a minimal amount to Player 1, something they might just barely accept. Offering 1 unit of item 1 might be reasonable. I'll try this.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Since we are in round 2, if we reach an agreement, the deal is discounted by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Now let's say I propose an offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to the other player, which means I get all the items for myself, this would have an undiscounded value of 591 and a discounted value of 531.9 > 247.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer, if accepted, is worth 33.3, far less than my outside offer of 247.\n    *   My potential offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to the other player and keeping the rest would have a value greater than my outside offer when discounted.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. It gives me far less than my outside offer of 247. I should make a counteroffer to receive the most of the items. Since it's round 2, I will aim to get all the items with a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 35 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 94 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 39 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 11 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 92 per unit\n*   **Total item pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor gamma is 0.9. This means that if we reach a deal in round 2, the value of that deal will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. If we reach a deal in round 3 it will be multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means I would get 0 units of everything. My value for this offer is 0.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    * I currently have all the items. So, giving anything away will decrease my total value.\n    * Let's consider keeping all the items, which means I am giving Player 1 an offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This would give me the following:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 35 = 105\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 94 = 188\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 39 = 78\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 11 = 22\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 92 = 368\n    *   Total value = 105 + 188 + 78 + 22 + 368 = 761. \n     *   If I make this offer at round 2, my value is 761 * 0.9 = 684.9\n    * My outside offer is 538.\n  * If I were to offer player 1 [1,0,0,0,0] for this round, I get:\n    * 2 unit of item 1: 2*35 = 70\n    * 2 units of item 2: 2*94 = 188\n    * 2 units of item 3: 2*39 = 78\n    * 2 units of item 4: 2*11 = 22\n    * 4 units of item 5: 4*92 = 368\n    * Total value: 726\n    * Adjusted for time: 726 * .9 = 653.4\n      * Offering anything is less good than keeping all the items, 684.9 > 653.4\n\n*  Comparison to outside offer value: My best possible counter offer is 684.9, which is greater than 538. So, I should try to make a counteroffer that gives me all the items (as opposed to walking).\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is 0, which is terrible, and lower than my outside offer of 538.\n*   My analysis indicates that a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] would give me my total value of 761, adjusted for the round discount, this would be 761 * 0.9 = 684.9. This is greater than my outside offer.\n*   Since we are in round 2, my counteroffer will be the final offer I can make.

Let's consider a few examples of item distributions for me, and the total value:\n    *  **Keep all items**:\n       *   Item 1: 5 * 22 = 110\n       *   Item 2: 2 * 39 = 78\n       *   Item 3: 2 * 7 = 14\n       *   Item 4: 2 * 54 = 108\n       *   Item 5: 7 * 10 = 70\n       *   Total Value = 380\n    * **Give player 2 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 of item 5**:\n       *   Item 1: 3 * 22 = 66\n       *   Item 2: 1 * 39 = 39\n       *   Item 3: 1 * 7 = 7\n       *   Item 4: 1 * 54 = 54\n       *   Item 5: 4 * 10 = 40\n       *   Total Value = 206\n    * **Give player 2 1 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 1 of item 5**:\n       *   Item 1: 4 * 22 = 88\n       *   Item 2: 2 * 39 = 78\n       *   Item 3: 2 * 7 = 14\n       *   Item 4: 2 * 54 = 108\n       *   Item 5: 6 * 10 = 60\n       *   Total Value = 348\n        *   Give player 2 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5\n             *   Item 1: 5 * 22 = 110\n             *   Item 2: 2 * 39 = 78\n             *   Item 3: 2 * 7 = 14\n             *   Item 4: 2 * 54 = 108\n             *   Item 5: 7 * 10 = 70\n             *   Total Value = 380\n    * I want to start with a proposal that favors me. Therefore I will offer the minimum amount possible to Player 2 (0 for each item).\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** I need to make an offer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 379.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince there's no offer on the table, I can't accept or walk away. I should make an offer which gives me good value. The counter offer that gives me the best value is to keep all the items for myself, which also gives me value greater than my outside offer. Therefore I will offer 0 of each item to Player 2.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 984.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 76\n    *   Item 2: 77\n    *   Item 3: 72\n    *   Item 4: 48\n    *   Item 5: 84\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that if the negotiation takes longer, the final deal's value to both players will decrease by a factor of 0.9 for every additional round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I'm the first player, I need to make the first offer to Player 2. I need to figure out a strategy that maximizes my utility while taking into account the discount factor and my outside offer. I also need to take into account that player two also has an outside offer and will also be trying to maximize their utility. I want to make an offer that they are at least potentially interested in. \n\n    My total value for all items is (6 * 76) + (3 * 77) + (5 * 72) + (3 * 48) + (3 * 84) = 456 + 231 + 360 + 144 + 252 = 1443. To make a reasonable first offer, let's consider offering roughly half of the total item value to player 2. I don't know player 2s preferences, so I need to make sure that it includes some units of each item. So, I'll create a counter offer where I give player 2:\n    * Item 1: 3 units\n    * Item 2: 1 unit\n    * Item 3: 2 units\n    * Item 4: 1 unit\n    * Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThis means I keep:\n    * Item 1: 3 units\n    * Item 2: 2 unit\n    * Item 3: 3 units\n    * Item 4: 2 units\n    * Item 5: 2 units\n\nThis gives me the following value:\n    * Item 1: 3 * 76 = 228\n    * Item 2: 2 * 77 = 154\n    * Item 3: 3 * 72 = 216\n    * Item 4: 2 * 48 = 96\n    * Item 5: 2 * 84 = 168\n    Total: 228 + 154 + 216 + 96 + 168 = 862\n\nI need to compare this to my outside offer of 984. The value of 862 now is better than the discounted value of 862 in later rounds, so I need to make my first offer to Player 2. Since the value of this offer is less than my outside offer I should consider making an offer that is more favorable to me. Let's try a slightly more aggressive approach, offering:\n\n    * Item 1: 2 units\n    * Item 2: 1 unit\n    * Item 3: 1 units\n    * Item 4: 1 unit\n    * Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThis means I keep:\n    * Item 1: 4 units\n    * Item 2: 2 unit\n    * Item 3: 4 units\n    * Item 4: 2 units\n    * Item 5: 2 units\n\nThis gives me the following value:\n    * Item 1: 4 * 76 = 304\n    * Item 2: 2 * 77 = 154\n    * Item 3: 4 * 72 = 288\n    * Item 4: 2 * 48 = 96\n    * Item 5: 2 * 84 = 168\n    Total: 304 + 154 + 288 + 96 + 168 = 1010\n\nThis value, 1010, is greater than my outside offer and, since this is the first round, is not discounted. I will make this counteroffer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer that maximizes my value above my outside offer while giving the other player something they might potentially accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 1142.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 72\n    *   Item 2: 43\n    *   Item 3: 22\n    *   Item 4: 96\n    *   Item 5: 80\n*   **Total Pool of Items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of accepting it in round 1, and an offer in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value of accepting it in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit\n    My value for this offer is:\n        *   2 * 72 (Item 1) + 1 * 43 (Item 2) + 1 * 22 (Item 3) + 1 * 96 (Item 4) + 1 * 80 (Item 5) = 144 + 43 + 22 + 96 + 80 = 385\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's think about what a good counteroffer might be. I want to maximize my value while considering the discount factor. If the other player is rational, we should both be better off than if we walk.\n\nLet's consider the allocation where I take all the items that I value the most, and give away the rest. In other words, I should be aiming to get at least 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\nThat's 3 * 72 + 2 * 43 + 3 * 22 + 2 * 96 + 2 * 80 = 216 + 86 + 66 + 192 + 160 = 720.\nThen I can also consider an offer to give them [3, 1, 2, 1, 1], so that I keep [3, 2, 3, 2, 2], which gives me a value of 720. If I offer that counter offer, I am still getting the majority share, but not everything.\nSince we have a discount rate of 0.9, I should not make an offer at this stage with a present value of less than my offer. I could be making a costly mistake.\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n    *   Current offer value: 385\n    *   Outside offer value: 1142\n    *   My current value with my ideal split is 720.\n    The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer value, so it would be foolish to accept it.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of 385 is far below my outside offer of 1142, and is well below a more optimal allocation of my share of the goods. Therefore, it is best to make a counteroffer.\n* I think a fair offer for me is the one where I keep 3 units of each item 1, 3, 4, and 2 units of items 2, 5. That is, I offer the other player [3,1,2,1,1].\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Therefore, I will not be making a counteroffer that gives the remainder of the items to myself.\n     \n     I should now consider making a counter offer that would lead to value above my outside offer. Considering the value of the items, and the current offer, I believe it is unlikely I will get a deal where my total discounted value surpasses my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince the discounted value of the current offer (522.9) is lower than my outside offer (984), and the value of the best case counter offer is also below my outside offer, I should walk away.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and make a decision for round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 24. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 80\n    *   Item 2: 76\n    *   Item 3: 73\n    *   Item 4: 54\n    *   Item 5: 52\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that deals reached in later rounds are worth slightly less to both players. If the process concludes after round 1, the value of the outcome is multiplied by gamma^0 = 1; if the process concludes after round 2 the value of the outcome is multiplied by gamma^1 = 0.9; if the process concludes after round 3 the value of the outcome is multiplied by gamma^2 = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so I cannot assess accepting an offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** As Player 1, this is the first move, so the potential counteroffers are my initial offers. I need to make a proposal on how to divide up the 27 total items, between the 2 players, that maximizes my return. \n\nSince this is round 1, I have the most leverage in a negotiation because my counteroffer value will not be discounted. I want to propose an offer that gives Player 2 just enough to stay engaged, so they do not walk away. An equal division of the goods would give both players an equal amount of the goods, and that would be the fairest. However, Player 2 likely has different valuations than me. So if Player 2 has very high values for item 1 and 2 and low values for 3, 4, and 5, we can propose to give them more of items 1 and 2. However I have no idea what the values of player 2 are, so an even split seems like the best strategy to start with. To propose this offer, I must propose giving Player 2 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. This keeps the remaining items for myself. My value for this offer is then:\n\n3 units of item 1 = 3 * 80 = 240\n3 units of item 2 = 3 * 76 = 228\n3 units of item 3 = 3 * 73 = 219\n2 units of item 4 = 2 * 54 = 108\n3 units of item 5 = 3 * 52 = 156\nTotal value = 240 + 228 + 219 + 108 + 156 = 951\n\n951 > 24, so this offer is way better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no offer on the table and my outside offer is 24, it does not make sense to walk away now, as my proposed offer is very much better than 24. I should make an initial offer to the other player, as described above.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 3, 2, 3]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine my best course of action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 325. This is my guaranteed fallback option if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 18 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 96 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 52 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 65 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 57 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that receiving value later is worth less than receiving it now. Specifically, the value after round r is worth 0.9^(r-1) of the face value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I'm Player 1 and this is round 1, I need to make an initial offer. To assess potential offers, I need to think about what's the minimum I should be willing to accept, since I know my outside offer is 325. Let's consider giving Player 2 half of each item, if possible, to see what the value to me would be. If I gave Player 2 the following:\n    * Item 1: 0 unit\n    * Item 2: 1 unit\n    * Item 3: 1 unit\n    * Item 4: 2 units\n    * Item 5: 1 unit\n\n     Then I would keep\n    * Item 1: 1 unit = 1 * 18 = 18\n    * Item 2: 2 units = 2 * 96 = 192\n    * Item 3: 2 units = 2 * 52 = 104\n    * Item 4: 2 units = 2 * 65 = 130\n    * Item 5: 2 units = 2 * 57 = 114\n   Total: 558\n\n     If I gave Player 2 the following:\n    * Item 1: 0 unit\n    * Item 2: 0 unit\n    * Item 3: 0 unit\n    * Item 4: 0 unit\n    * Item 5: 0 unit\n\n   Then I would keep\n    * Item 1: 1 unit = 1 * 18 = 18\n    * Item 2: 3 units = 3 * 96 = 288\n    * Item 3: 3 units = 3 * 52 = 156\n    * Item 4: 4 units = 4 * 65 = 260\n    * Item 5: 3 units = 3 * 57 = 171\n   Total = 893. \n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** I need to make an offer that is still better for me than walking away with 325. Since I don't know player 2's values, it is advantageous to be more conservative. Offering them half of everything does not work, since I can not give half of item 1. Lets start by offering them very little, in the hopes that they are also trying to maximize their value. I'll offer them:\n   * Item 1: 0 unit\n    * Item 2: 1 unit\n    * Item 3: 1 unit\n    * Item 4: 1 unit\n    * Item 5: 1 unit\n\n     Then I would keep\n    * Item 1: 1 unit = 1 * 18 = 18\n    * Item 2: 2 units = 2 * 96 = 192\n    * Item 3: 2 units = 2 * 52 = 104\n    * Item 4: 3 units = 3 * 65 = 195\n    * Item 5: 2 units = 2 * 57 = 114\n    Total = 623 which is much better than my outside offer of 325.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   I will propose a counteroffer which offers player 2: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Specifically, if this concludes at round 1, the value is *1, round 2 is *0.9, and round 3 is *0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would keep the rest.\n\n    *   My value for the offer:\n        *   Item 1: 1 * 97 = 97 (since I keep 1 unit)\n        *   Item 2: 2 * 71 = 142 (since I keep 3-1=2 units)\n        *   Item 3: 2 * 77 = 154 (since I keep 3-1=2 units)\n        *   Item 4: 3 * 25 = 75 (since I keep 4-1=3 units)\n        *   Item 5: 2 * 62 = 124 (since I keep 3-1=2 units)\n        *   Total value = 97 + 142 + 154 + 75 + 124 = 592.\n\n    *   This is lower than my outside offer of 729.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since the current offer is so low, a counteroffer is highly likely. I need to consider what a good counteroffer would be. I would want an offer that is equal to or greater than 729 to even consider not walking away. Let's consider offering Player 1 something and see the value:\n\n    * To get at least 729, let's first calculate the value of the total items we have\n        * Item 1: 1 * 97 = 97\n        * Item 2: 3 * 71 = 213\n        * Item 3: 3 * 77 = 231\n        * Item 4: 4 * 25 = 100\n        * Item 5: 3 * 62 = 186\n    * Total Value = 97 + 213 + 231 + 100 + 186 = 827\n    * Since our total value is 827, we know any offer that we keep more than 88.1% is better than our outside offer.\n    * Lets try giving the player 1 unit of each, so our offer will be [1,1,1,1,1].\n    *   My value for the counteroffer keeping:\n        *   Item 1: 0 * 97 = 0\n        *   Item 2: 2 * 71 = 142\n        *   Item 3: 2 * 77 = 154\n        *   Item 4: 3 * 25 = 75\n        *   Item 5: 2 * 62 = 124\n        *   Total value = 0+142+154+75+124 = 495\n    * This is not even near the outside offer. It makes sense to keep the valuable items. \n    * Let's see what happens if I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means that I will have all my items and therefore my value is 827. This is clearly better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer of 592 is less than my outside offer value of 729. If I counteroffer with [0,0,0,0,0], I get the full 827.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of 592 is significantly lower than my outside offer of 729. Therefore I will not accept.\n*   I will not walk away yet, as there is a chance for a better deal.\n*   I will make a counteroffer that gives the other player nothing. This will give me a value of 827, which is greater than my outside offer, therefore the best possible outcome.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Since it's round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], meaning I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1 = 0 * 97 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 71 = 71\n    *   1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 77 = 77\n    *   1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 25 = 25\n    *   1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 62 = 62\n    *   Total value of current offer: 0 + 71 + 77 + 25 + 62 = 235\n    *   Discounted value of the current offer: 235 * 0.9 = 211.5\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep the majority of items that are valuable to me. This would be [0,0,0,0,0] which they offered before but lets recalculate just to make sure.\n    *   If I keep everything (offer [0,0,0,0,0] to them), I get:\n        *  1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 97 = 97\n        *  3 units of item 2 = 3 * 71 = 213\n        *  3 units of item 3 = 3 * 77 = 231\n        *  4 units of item 4 = 4 * 25 = 100\n        *  3 units of item 5 = 3 * 62 = 186\n        * Total value = 97 + 213 + 231 + 100 + 186 = 827\n        *  Discounted Value = 827 * 0.9 = 744.3\n    *   Let us also try [0,1,1,1,1] to calculate that as a sanity check:\n         *   0 units of item 1 = 0 * 97 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 71 = 71\n    *   1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 77 = 77\n    *   1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 25 = 25\n    *   1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 62 = 62\n    * Total value of current offer: 0 + 71 + 77 + 25 + 62 = 235\n    * Discounted value of the current offer: 235 * 0.9 = 211.5\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n* The current offer of 211.5 is much lower than my outside offer of 729, and I can achieve a much higher value by making a counteroffer (744.3).\n* Therefore, I will make a counteroffer to try and achieve that higher value. This is going to be a counteroffer of [0,0,0,0,0] which is where they get nothing and I get everything.\n* Since this is round 2, my counteroffer would have a discount of 0.9.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 4, 3, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 4, 3, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 120. This is my guaranteed fallback value if negotiations fail.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 58\n    *   Item 2: 38\n    *   Item 3: 95\n    *   Item 4: 18\n    *   Item 5: 8\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6 units\n    *   Item 2: 8 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an agreement in later rounds is worth less to me.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 4, 3, 0, 0].  This means I would receive:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 58 = 174\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 38 = 152\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 95 = 285\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 18 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 8 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 174 + 152 + 285 + 0 + 0= 611\n\n    This is the value of the deal if I accept now. Because it is in round 1, there is no discount factor to apply.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since it is round 1, there is still room to negotiate. It might be worthwhile to propose a counteroffer that would give me more value. For example if I keep all of the items for myself my value is 6 * 58 + 8 * 38 + 5 * 95 + 1 * 18 + 5 * 8 = 348 + 304 + 475 + 18 + 40 = 1185\n\n    Let's look at a counter offer where I propose to give the other player half of each of the available units.\n\n    The other player would receive the following:\n     Item 1: 3 units\n    Item 2: 4 units\n    Item 3: 2 units\n    Item 4: 0 units\n    Item 5: 2 units\n\n    This leaves me with:\n    Item 1: 3 units\n    Item 2: 4 units\n    Item 3: 3 units\n    Item 4: 1 units\n    Item 5: 3 units\n\n    Value to me for this counteroffer:\n    Item 1: 3 * 58 = 174\n    Item 2: 4 * 38 = 152\n    Item 3: 3 * 95 = 285\n    Item 4: 1 * 18 = 18\n    Item 5: 3 * 8 = 24\n    Total = 653\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n\n    *   Current offer: 611\n    *   Counteroffer (as calculated above): 653\n    *   Outside offer: 120\n\n    The current offer of 611 is significantly better than my outside offer of 120, so walking away is not ideal. The potential counteroffer is better than the current offer so that would be better than accepting the current offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nGiven that the current offer is higher than my outside offer, I should not walk away. Since there are more rounds of negotiation, and a counteroffer offers me a better value, I should make a counteroffer.\n\nI will propose a counteroffer where I propose to give the other player half of the items I calculated earlier. This counteroffer is [3, 4, 2, 0, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 2, 0, 2]}\n```\n",

Therefore, I should not walk away unless I expect a much better offer in the next round.\n\n*  **Potential Counteroffers:**  I should try to improve upon the current offer while considering player 2 is also trying to maximize their value. Since my current offer is pretty good, I should avoid making a very aggressive counteroffer which might make the player 2 walk away. Given my high value for item 5, I can try and get more of those. I will try a counteroffer that gives more of items 3 and 4 to player 2 and take more of items 1,2 and 5. My first round offer was [3,4,3,0,0]. I will slightly modify this to [2,3,2,0,1]. That will give me [4,5,3,1,4] in the current round if accepted.\n\n    *   4 units of item 1: 4 * 19 = 76\n    *   5 units of item 2: 5 * 38 = 190\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 24 = 72\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 25 = 25\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 73 = 292\n    *   Total Value: 76 + 190 + 72 + 25 + 292 = 655\n    *   Discounted Value: 655 * 0.9 = 589.5\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is already better than my outside offer, but there's room for improvement. My potential counteroffer is also greater than the current offer, and would improve my position. The gain outweighs the risk of going to the next round.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer of [2, 3, 2, 0, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 2, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Since we are in round 2 and the discount factor is 0.9, I need an offer which gives me over 120 / 0.9 = 133.33 to beat my outside offer.\n\n    Let's consider an offer that tries to get the most value out of the items I value the most: Item 3 (value 95) and Item 1 (value 58).\n    I have 5 units of item 3, and player 1 is offering me 2, so there are 3 remaining.  I have 6 units of item 1, and player 1 is offering me 2, so there are 4 remaining.\n    If I keep all 3 remaining units of item 3 and 4 remaining units of item 1:\n        * 3 units of item 3: 3 * 95 = 285\n        * 4 units of item 1: 4 * 58 = 232\n        * 0 unit of item 2: 0 * 38 = 0\n        * 0 units of item 4: 0 * 18 = 0\n        * 0 unit of item 5: 0 * 8 = 0\n\n    This gives me a total of 285 + 232 = 517\n    Discounted Value = 517 * 0.9 = 465.3\n\n    Therefore, I'll make a counteroffer such that I get the remaining units of item 3 and 1, plus I will offer Player 1 all 8 units of item 2, all unit of item 4 and the remaining 4 units of item 5\n    *   Player 1 offer: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n    *   My remaining units = (6 - 2) = 4 units of item 1, (8-3) = 5 units of item 2, (5-2)=3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n    *   Counter offer is therefore: give player 1 the other 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, and the remaining 3 units of item 5, and the single unit of item 4.\n\n    Counteroffer: [4 - the 2 I have given player 1 in previous rounds, 8- the 3 player 1 has from the offer, 3 - the 2 I have been offered, 1, 4-1 that they have] =  [2, 5, 3, 1, 4]\n    The total of items given to player 1 = [2, 5, 3, 1, 4]\n    Items kept by me:\n        * 4 units of item 1: 4 * 58 = 232\n        * 3 units of item 3: 3 * 95 = 285\n        * Value of other items is zero.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer gives me a discounted value of 385.2.\n*   My outside offer is worth 120.\n*   A potential counteroffer gives me a discounted value of 465.3\n\nSince 385.2 > 120, the current offer is better than my outside option. The potential counteroffer gives me a significantly better value than the current offer. Since it is better than my outside offer value, and significantly better than accepting the current offer.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 4, 3, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 4, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 5, 3, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 5, 3, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 114\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 19\n    *   Item 2: 38\n    *   Item 3: 24\n    *   Item 4: 25\n    *   Item 5: 73\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6\n    *   Item 2: 8\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 1\n    *   Item 5: 5\n*  **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This is round 3, so the discount factor will be 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81. Any deal we make will have its value multiplied by 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 5, 3, 1, 4].  This means I would receive:\n    *   2 units of item 1\n    *   5 units of item 2\n    *   3 units of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   4 units of item 5\n\n    My value for this offer is:\n    (2 * 19) + (5 * 38) + (3 * 24) + (1 * 25) + (4 * 73) = 38 + 190 + 72 + 25 + 292 = 617\n    Adjusting for the discount factor, the current value of the offer to me is: 617 * 0.81 = 500.  We don't need to discount our outside offer as it would be received in the same round, and 114 would remain as 114.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** It's the final round, so any counteroffer by me will effectively be a walk if it's not accepted. Therefore, I need to assess if the current offer is better than walking.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer, valued at 500, is significantly better than my outside offer of 114.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer would give me a value of 500.\n*   Walking away would give me a value of 114.\n*   Making a counteroffer is pointless as it is the last round, so it would be treated the same as walking.\n\nSince 500 is far greater than 114, I should accept the current offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Since this is round 1, there is no current discount.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I am going first, I need to consider what I could offer Player 2. I want to maximize my value while also ensuring I get a better outcome than my outside offer.  I need to calculate total value for a number of potential counteroffers.  I will aim to offer the player a split where I receive over 98 in this first round.\n\n    Let's consider an equal split of the items:\n    *   Item 1: I keep 3 units (3 * 56 = 168)\n    *   Item 2: I keep 0 units (0 * 91 = 0)\n    *   Item 3: I keep 2.5 units (2.5 * 61 = 152.5)\n    *   Item 4: I keep 1.5 units (1.5 * 88 = 132)\n    *   Item 5: I keep 4 units (4 * 11 = 44)\n    Total Value to me: 168 + 0 + 152.5 + 132 + 44 = 496.5\n    Offer to Player 2:  [3, 0, 2.5, 1.5, 4]. Since this is not a valid offer since item units must be integers, let's try something more practical. \n\n    Let's consider a more realistic offer: I give the other player half of items that are available in even numbers and roughly half of the other items, rounded up or down such that they receive whole number amounts.\n    *   Item 1: I keep 3 units (3 * 56 = 168) and offer the other player 3 units.\n    *   Item 2: I keep 0 units (0 * 91 = 0) and offer the other player 0 units.\n    *   Item 3: I keep 3 units (3 * 61 = 183) and offer the other player 2 units.\n    *   Item 4: I keep 2 units (2 * 88 = 176) and offer the other player 1 unit.\n    *   Item 5: I keep 4 units (4 * 11 = 44) and offer the other player 4 units.\n    Total Value to me: 168 + 0 + 183 + 176 + 44 = 571\n\n    Since 571 > 98, this is a reasonable starting position for negotiation. Let's use this offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will not accept the current offer since there is no offer on the table.\n*   I will not walk away since I have a very high potential value if I make a reasonable counteroffer, 571 compared to my outside offer of 98.\n*   I will propose the counteroffer calculated above.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 1, 4]}\n```\n",

This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times the value of a deal in round 1. This encourages deals to be made early since the value is discounted over time.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 0, 2, 1, 4]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 3 units  (3 * 71 = 213)\n    *   Item 2: 0 units (0 * 92 = 0)\n    *   Item 3: 2 units  (2 * 84 = 168)\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit  (1 * 26 = 26)\n    *   Item 5: 4 units  (4 * 82 = 328)\n    *   Total value of current offer: 213 + 0 + 168 + 26 + 328 = 735\n\n    *   My value if I accept the offer in round 1 is 735 * 0.9^(1-1) = 735\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I will not assess the counteroffers yet as I will make the best counteroffer if needed.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer value is 1117. The current offer of 735 is much less than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer has a value of 735 which is less than my outside offer of 1117. Therefore, I should not accept this offer. \nI have two choices: walk away (and receive 1117) or make a counteroffer.\nI will make a counteroffer, and I will try to get at least my outside offer value of 1117.\n\nTo do this I need:\nItem 1: 3 units gives 213 value\nItem 2: 0 units gives 0 value\nItem 3: 2 units gives 168 value\nItem 4: 1 unit gives 26 value\nItem 5: 4 units gives 328 value\n\nCurrently, with this offer, I have 735 value. I need 1117, meaning I need an additional value of 382.\nI have 6 units of Item 1 available to take, currently I am getting 3, and they are worth 71 each. Each additional one is worth 71 to me.\nI have 0 units of Item 2 available to take, currently I am getting 0.\nI have 5 units of Item 3 available to take, currently I am getting 2, and they are worth 84 each. Each additional one is worth 84 to me.\nI have 3 units of Item 4 available to take, currently I am getting 1, and they are worth 26 each. Each additional one is worth 26 to me.\nI have 8 units of Item 5 available to take, currently I am getting 4, and they are worth 82 each. Each additional one is worth 82 to me.\n\nLet's try taking 3 more of item 5, which would be 3 * 82 = 246, which would make my new value 981.\nI still need an additional 136 value.\nIf I take the last unit of Item 5, that is another 82 value, which gets me to 1063.\nI now need 54.\nIf I also take the last two of item 3, I add 168, which would make it too much, so lets take one. That adds 84, and takes my total to 1147. That gets me what I want, at 1147, so I want to take 3 of Item 1, 0 of Item 2, 3 of Item 3, 1 of Item 4 and 7 of Item 5.

This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 0 - 0 = 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 8 - 1 = 7 units\n    My value for this offer is: (3 * 56) + (0 * 91) + (3 * 61) + (1 * 88) + (7 * 11) = 168 + 0 + 183 + 88 + 77 = 516\n    Considering the discount factor of 0.9, the present value is 516 * 0.9 = 464.4.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's think about what a fair split might look like and also consider giving the other player their offered items and asking for something more.\n     *Offer 1: Trying to get a better share of the items. I will keep 4 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 7 of item 5 and give the rest to player 2. This means I offer player 2: [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]\n        My value for this offer would be: (4 * 56) + (0 * 91) + (3 * 61) + (2 * 88) + (7 * 11) = 224 + 0 + 183 + 176 + 77 = 660.\n        Present value = 660 * 0.9 = 594\n     *Offer 2: Giving player 2 the previously offered items [3, 0, 2, 2, 1] and asking to keep everything else.\n        This would give me: (3 * 56) + (0 * 91) + (3 * 61) + (1 * 88) + (7 * 11) = 516.\n        Present value = 516 * 0.9 = 464.4\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is 98. Both the current offer (464.4) and even a less beneficial offer to player 2 (594) are significantly better than my outside offer at this round.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of 464.4 is very good compared to my outside offer of 98, and the counteroffer of 594 is even more so. Since I am not sure what Player 2's strategy is, but I know that if I get to the final round Player 2 will not accept any counter offer, my best bet is to send the counter offer to get a higher share of the resources.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 221. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 62 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 32 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 17 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 90 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 59 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   3 units of item 1\n    *   8 units of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   6 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me than offers accepted in earlier rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    Since I'm the first player in the first round, I will calculate the value of keeping all the items for myself and then consider a fair offer. I have 3 units of item 1, 8 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 6 of item 5.\n    Value of keeping everything = (3 * 62) + (8 * 32) + (2 * 17) + (2 * 90) + (6 * 59) = 186 + 256 + 34 + 180 + 354 = 1010. \n    Now let's consider making an offer where I give away half the items I have (if the number is even) or round up the share of items I give away to the other player.\n    Offer to the other player : [2, 4, 1, 1, 3]\n    Value of keeping the rest = (1 * 62) + (4 * 32) + (1 * 17) + (1 * 90) + (3 * 59) = 62 + 128 + 17 + 90 + 177 = 474\n    Let's try to propose an offer that will give the other player more, to increase chances of it being accepted. Let's give the other player [2, 5, 1, 1, 4].\n    Value of keeping this = (1 * 62) + (3 * 32) + (1 * 17) + (1 * 90) + (2 * 59) = 62 + 96 + 17 + 90 + 118 = 383.\n    Let's do one more calculation, offering [1, 3, 1, 1, 2]\n    Value of keeping the rest = (2 * 62) + (5 * 32) + (1 * 17) + (1 * 90) + (4 * 59) = 124 + 160 + 17 + 90 + 236 = 627\n    I will start with an offer of [1, 3, 1, 1, 2] to the other player\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I need to make the first move. I will offer [1, 3, 1, 1, 2]. This ensures I keep a good portion of items and get a value of 627, while not being too greedy. It is worth noting that this 627 is already significantly more than my outside offer of 221, so it's a good starting position.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 1, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

This means they are keeping [2, 5, 1, 1, 4] for themselves.  Let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 5 = 5\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 46 = 138\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 84 = 84\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 94 = 94\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 38 = 76\n    *   Total value of current offer: 5 + 138 + 84 + 94 + 76 = 397\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (397) is less than my outside offer value (446).\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what counteroffer would be beneficial to me.  Let's calculate my total value of all the items:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 5 = 15\n    *   8 units of item 2: 8 * 46 = 368\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 84 = 168\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 94 = 188\n    *   6 units of item 5: 6 * 38 = 228\n    *   Total value: 15 + 368 + 168 + 188 + 228 = 967\n    I will aim for a counteroffer that gives me more value than 446 and gives player 1 enough value that they will agree.  I also need to consider the discount factor. Since this is round 1, there is no discount factor.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer (397) is less than my outside option (446). Accepting this offer would not be beneficial.\n*   I will make a counteroffer that favors myself to see if Player 1 will move.  I'll offer them [0, 3, 0, 0, 2].  This means I'd receive [3, 5, 2, 2, 4]. The value of this offer to me is 3*5+5*46+2*84+2*94+4*38 = 15 + 230 + 168 + 188 + 152 = 753.

I can calculate what I receive if I were to demand that the opponent receive half of each item, rounded up for me and rounded down for them, and compare this to my outside offer and the current offer\n    *   Item 1: I would get 2 units\n    *   Item 2: I would get 4 units\n    *   Item 3: I would get 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: I would get 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: I would get 3 units\n    *   My value of this = 2 * 62 + 4 * 32 + 1 * 17 + 1 * 90 + 3 * 59 = 124 + 128 + 17 + 90 + 177 = 536\n    *   Adjusted Value = 536 * 0.9 = 482.4\n    \n   *   Let's look at a more aggressive split where I receive the majority of the items:\n    *   Item 1: I get 3 units\n    *   Item 2: I get 5 units\n    *   Item 3: I get 2 units\n    *   Item 4: I get 2 unit\n    *   Item 5: I get 4 units\n    *   My value of this = 3*62 + 5*32 + 2*17 + 2*90 + 4*59 = 186 + 160 + 34 + 180 + 236 = 796\n    *   Adjusted Value = 796 * 0.9 = 716.4\n\n    *   My outside offer value is 221.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer value is 192.6, which is less than my outside offer of 221.\n*   The value of the more balanced counteroffer is 482.4, which is greater than my outside offer.\n*   The value of the more aggressive counteroffer is 716.4, which is greater than my outside offer.\n*   I should not accept the current offer.\n*   I should not walk away. I should make a counteroffer.\n*   I should propose a more aggressive counteroffer. This gives me a better chance of receiving more items, given the other player is offering me so little right now. This would be a counteroffer of [0, 3, 0, 0, 2] to player 2. This is what would leave me with 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]}\n```\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 446\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 46, Item 3: 84, Item 4: 94, Item 5: 38\n*   **Total pool of items:** 3 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer now is more valuable than the same offer in the next round, by a factor of 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]. This means I receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 5 = 0\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 46 = 138\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 84 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 94 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 38 = 76\n    *   Total value of current offer = 0 + 138 + 0 + 0 + 76 = 214\n\n    This is less than my outside offer of 446.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few counteroffers. Since I want to maximize my value, I should aim to secure more of the items I value highly (items 3 and 4). \n    * If I offer Player 1 all of item 1 and 2, but nothing else, my offer is [3, 8, 0, 0, 0] and my value will be:\n       * Item 1: 0*5 = 0\n       * Item 2: 0 * 46 = 0\n       * Item 3: 2*84 = 168\n       * Item 4: 2*94 = 188\n       * Item 5: 6*38 = 228\n       * My value: 0 + 0 + 168 + 188 + 228 = 584. Discounted value is 0.9 * 584 = 525.6\n    \n    Since this round is round 2, any deal is multiplied by 0.9^(2-1)=0.9. If I walk away, I receive my outside value 446 multiplied by 0.9. So 446*0.9 = 401.4\n*   **Comparison:** The current offer of 214 is much less than my outside offer value. If I make a good counteroffer that I value higher than 446, I will want to make a counteroffer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable.  Walking away in round 2 gives 446*0.9 = 401.4 to me. My offer of giving away all item 1 and item 2 gives a value of 525.6 to me. I should make this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 8, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

I need to figure out what offer to make to the other player so I can keep the remainder. Let's consider a few possibilities, aiming for a deal that is better than my outside offer. I have to give an offer for what Player 2 gets, and then the remaining items are mine. I should try to grab valuable items, and offer them the less valuable ones. A good approach might be to try and take all of the item 3s, as these have the highest value for me, and then try to get all the item 4s too. \n    * Let's consider giving Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 5, 0 of item 3, and 0 of item 4.  This means I keep 0 item 1, 3 item 2, 8 item 3, 5 item 4, and 3 item 5. This would give a value of 3*34 + 8*91 + 5*80 + 3*35 = 102 + 728 + 400 + 105 = 1335 which is better than my outside offer.\n    * Let's check what happens if I go for a very greedy offer, like giving Player 2 only 1 unit of item 2 and 1 unit of item 5. If Player 2 gets 1 item 2 and 1 item 5, that means I have 1 item 1, 4 item 2, 8 item 3, 5 item 4, and 4 item 5. That would give me 56 + 4*34 + 8*91 + 5*80 + 4*35 = 56 + 136 + 728 + 400 + 140 = 1460. This is even better than my previous attempt, so let's go with this!\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n* I will not accept the current offer, because there isn't one.\n* I will not walk away because I know that I can do better than my outside offer in the first round, if the other agent will take it.\n*   I should make a counteroffer, giving Player 2 1 unit of item 2 and 1 unit of item 5 and keeping the rest.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 969. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 41\n    *   Item 2: 40\n    *   Item 3: 72\n    *   Item 4: 65\n    *   Item 5: 83\n*   **Total pool of items:** There are 1 unit of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that outcomes in later rounds are worth less than outcomes in earlier rounds. It also means that walking away will give the outside offer without any discounting.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 1, 0, 0, 1], meaning Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.  This means that I will keep 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.  Let's calculate the value:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 41 = 41\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 40 = 160\n    *   8 units of item 3: 8 * 72 = 576\n    *   5 units of item 4: 5 * 65 = 325\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 83 = 332\n    *   Total value of current offer: 41 + 160 + 576 + 325 + 332 = 1434\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**  The total value of the current offer (1434) is greater than my outside offer (969).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  It is unlikely that Player 1 will accept the current offer, as it doesn't offer them a significant value. If I reject it, then I will want to offer Player 1 something that provides me with a value greater than my outside offer. Given the discount factor, it's important to conclude a deal now and not risk losing out to the outside offer due to the discount factor. A counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] would provide me with a value of 1 * 41 + 5 * 40 + 8 * 72 + 5 * 65 + 5 * 83 = 1557. This is the max. I will attempt to get the max.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is quite good. The value (1434) is much better than my outside offer (969). I will attempt to make an offer that will return me the full value for all items in the game. If I was going to lose my outside offer this would not make sense. Given there is only one discount factor applied for the second round, I will attempt to claim a greater value of the items.\n\nMy action is to make a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

The total value of all the items is 4*96 + 5*89 + 3*92 + 4*13 + 6*58 = 384 + 445 + 276 + 52 + 348 = 1505. Half of that is 752.5. Let's start with an offer of 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this counteroffer:\n    * Item 1: (4-1)*96 = 288\n    * Item 2: (5-2)*89 = 267\n    * Item 3: (3-1)*92 = 184\n    * Item 4: (4-1)*13 = 39\n    * Item 5: (6-2)*58 = 232\n    * Total: 288 + 267 + 184 + 39 + 232 = 1010.\nThis would leave me with a value of 1010, less than my outside offer. Let's try offering the other player fewer items, let's try giving 0, 1, 0, 0, 1.\n     * My value for this counteroffer:\n    * Item 1: (4-0)*96 = 384\n    * Item 2: (5-1)*89 = 356\n    * Item 3: (3-0)*92 = 276\n    * Item 4: (4-0)*13 = 52\n    * Item 5: (6-1)*58 = 290\n    * Total: 384 + 356 + 276 + 52 + 290 = 1358\nThis gives a value of 1358, higher than my outside offer. This seems like a good starting point.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n I should make a counteroffer that gives away fewer items than my last potential offer calculation. The values look good for my position.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

This means that if the negotiation goes to round 2, the value of the outcome will be multiplied by 0.9, and if it goes to round 3, it will be multiplied by 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81. This makes getting a deal sooner more valuable.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This means they are offering me 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    *   My value for the current offer: (0 * 68) + (1 * 19) + (0 * 38) + (0 * 41) + (1 * 7) = 0 + 19 + 0 + 0 + 7 = 26\n    *   The value of this is less than my outside offer, it is not something I should accept\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer where I aim to get a larger portion of the items, while still leaving something for Player 1. I will offer a portion to player 1 such that what I keep is of value higher than my outside offer value. Let's calculate my value if I offered them 1 unit of each item (excluding item 5 as I don't value it much). \n    * Items I would keep: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n        * Value of kept items: 3 * 68 + 4 * 19 + 2 * 38 + 3 * 41 + 5 * 7 = 204 + 76 + 76 + 123 + 35 = 514\n        * I will offer to give the remaining items to Player 1: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5\n            * My counteroffer is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** \n    *   The current offer value (26) is less than my outside offer value (169). I should not accept this.\n    *   My potential counteroffer would yield me value 514 > 169. It makes sense to make a counteroffer\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer.\n*   I should not walk away since I can get more than 169.\n*   I should propose the counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Let's consider an offer that gives me the maximum possible value: I keep all the items except one unit of item 1 for player 2.\n    *   Player 2: [1,0,0,0,0]\n    *   Me: [3,5,3,4,6]\n    *   My value: (3*96) + (5*89) + (3*92) + (4*13) + (6*58) = 288 + 445 + 276 + 52 + 348 = 1409\n    * Discounted value = 1409 * 0.9 = 1268.1\n\n    Let's also consider an equal split counteroffer:\n        * Player 2: [2, 2, 1, 2, 3]\n        * Me: [2, 3, 2, 2, 3]\n        * My value: (2*96) + (3*89) + (2*92) + (2*13) + (3*58) = 192 + 267 + 184 + 26 + 174 = 843\n        * Discounted value: 843 * 0.9 = 758.7. Not better than my outside offer.\n\n    Now, let's propose a counter offer that gives me a little more.\n        * Player 2: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n        * Me: [3, 4, 3, 3, 5]\n        * My value: (3*96) + (4*89) + (3*92) + (3*13) + (5*58) = 288 + 356 + 276 + 39 + 290 = 1249\n        * Discounted value: 1249 * 0.9 = 1124.1\n        \n        The first counteroffer seems the most beneficial to me, but it is likely that player 2 will reject it. However, we still have another round of negotiation. Therefore, I will propose a reasonable counteroffer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 313.2 to me, which is much less than my outside offer value of 1088. If I were to accept I would be losing value.\nGiven that the round has advanced to round 2 and I would still like to try to get a deal, I should make a counter offer.

This is the guaranteed value I receive if we don't reach a deal.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 68\n    *   Item 2: 19\n    *   Item 3: 38\n    *   Item 4: 41\n    *   Item 5: 7\n*   **Total Pool of Items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4\n    *   Item 2: 5\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 4\n    *   Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means that if the negotiation concludes in round 2, the outcome will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. If it concludes in round 3 it would be multiplied by 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]. This means I would get:\n    *   1 unit of Item 1: 1 * 68 = 68\n    *   1 unit of Item 2: 1 * 19 = 19\n    *   0 units of Item 3: 0 * 38 = 0\n    *   1 unit of Item 4: 1 * 41 = 41\n    *   1 unit of Item 5: 1 * 7 = 7\n    *   Total value of current offer: 68 + 19 + 0 + 41 + 7 = 135\n    *   Discounted value of current offer (round 2): 135 * 0.9 = 121.5\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I will consider what I would receive if I were to offer Player 1 the items they originally offered in Round 1. That would leave me with the following:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4. Value: 4 * 68 = 272\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4. Value: 4 * 19 = 76\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3. Value: 3 * 38 = 114\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4. Value: 4 * 41 = 164\n    *   Item 5: 6 - 1 = 5. Value: 5 * 7 = 35\n    *   Total Value: 272 + 76 + 114 + 164 + 35 = 661\n    *   Discounted value of counteroffer (round 3): 661 * 0.81 = 535.41\n   This is very good so I'll try that.\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n    *   The current offer's discounted value (121.5) is lower than my outside offer (169).\n    *   The potential counteroffer is higher than my outside offer (535.41 > 169).\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer, as it's less valuable than my outside offer.\n*   I should not walk away because there are better options available.\n*   I should propose the counteroffer to Player 1 with the distribution that was their round 1 offer. This counteroffer gives me higher value than the outside offer after discounting.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

This incentivizes making a deal earlier.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since there's no current offer, I will have to propose the first offer. I want to maximize my value, so I should try to keep as much of the valuable items as possible. I will calculate the value of various offers to compare with my outside offer. A reasonable approach might be to offer a small share of the total amount of the item to Player 2, focusing on the less valuable items first.\n\n    Let's consider a few potential offers, keeping track of what I retain:\n\n    *   **Offer 1: Give away 0 of each item:**\n        *   My items: [1, 1, 2, 7, 1]\n        *   My value: (1 * 37) + (1 * 68) + (2 * 68) + (7 * 30) + (1 * 75) = 37 + 68 + 136 + 210 + 75 = 526\n    *   **Offer 2: Give away [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]:**\n         *   My items: [1, 1, 2, 5, 1]\n         *   My value: (1 * 37) + (1 * 68) + (2 * 68) + (5 * 30) + (1 * 75) = 37 + 68 + 136 + 150 + 75 = 466\n     *   **Offer 3: Give away [0, 0, 1, 2, 0]:**\n        *   My items: [1, 1, 1, 5, 1]\n        *   My value: (1 * 37) + (1 * 68) + (1 * 68) + (5 * 30) + (1 * 75) = 37 + 68 + 68 + 150 + 75 = 398\n     *   **Offer 4: Give away [0, 0, 1, 3, 0]:**\n        *   My items: [1, 1, 1, 4, 1]\n        *    My value: (1 * 37) + (1 * 68) + (1 * 68) + (4 * 30) + (1 * 75) = 37 + 68 + 68 + 120 + 75 = 368\n    *   **Offer 5: Give away [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]:**\n         *   My items: [1, 1, 2, 6, 1]\n         *   My value: (1 * 37) + (1 * 68) + (2 * 68) + (6 * 30) + (1 * 75) = 37 + 68 + 136 + 180 + 75 = 496\n    *  **Offer 6: Give away [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]**\n       *   My items: [1, 1, 2, 7, 1]\n       *   My value: (1 * 37) + (1 * 68) + (2 * 68) + (7 * 30) + (1 * 75) = 37 + 68 + 136 + 210 + 75 = 526\n\n    All of the offers above give value to me greater than my outside offer of 297. To maximize my expected value, I want to start with an offer that gives away very little to Player 2.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I must make the first move. Based on my analysis, I will propose the offer that keeps all items for myself (offer 6) and offers the other player 0 units of each item, and if this is not accepted then I will consider offers that give away small amounts of the lower value items in later rounds.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 317\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 92, Item 2: 32, Item 3: 86, Item 4: 10, Item 5: 100\n*   **Total pool of items:** 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1, so there is currently no discount.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I get all items.\n    *   My value for this offer is: (1 * 92) + (1 * 32) + (2 * 86) + (7 * 10) + (1 * 100) = 92 + 32 + 172 + 70 + 100 = 466\n*  **Potential counteroffers:** We need to consider counteroffers, but note that Player 1 has offered me nothing and kept everything for themselves. Any reasonable counteroffer will give them some items, which will mean I have less, decreasing my value relative to the current offer.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer gives me 466, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 317. Any offer with less than 317 will be worse than walking away.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is excellent, since it gives me the full value of all the items at 466. Any counteroffer that gives Player 1 items will decrease my total value, therefore it would not be beneficial for me to do so.\n*   Since 466 > 317, I should accept the current offer rather than walk away and take my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Let's calculate the value of a few possible offers to compare. I need to make an offer to player 1, so this will be the number of items I give them.\n        *   **Offer 1 (Even Split):** Giving Player 1 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.

I should try for an offer where I keep items 1 and 5.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of 215 is significantly lower than my outside offer of 729.\n*   If I make an offer to keep all my high value items (1 and 5), the value to me will be 577. That's less than my outside offer, but I still think it is worth making a counteroffer as a walk will immediately force the outside offer, whereas making a counter offer gives us a chance to improve the value.\n*   It is round 1 and the discount factor will reduce the value of later round acceptances, so it's worth trying to get a better deal.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the best course of action is to make a counteroffer that is highly advantageous to me, and hope Player 1 accepts it, or at least tries to make a better deal in the next round, since their opening offer was very poor.\n\nI propose that I keep all of item 1 and 5. This means giving 0 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5 to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 8, 5, 6, 0]}\n```\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 8, 5, 6, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 8, 5, 6, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 948.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 68\n    *   Item 2: 69\n    *   Item 3: 10\n    *   Item 4: 31\n    *   Item 5: 47\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4\n    *   Item 2: 8\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 6\n    *   Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor gamma is 0.9. This means the value of an outcome is multiplied by 0.9^(r-1), where r is the round number. Since we are in round 2, any accepted outcome's value will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This slightly reduces the incentive to wait for a deal.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer to me is [0, 8, 5, 6, 0].  This means Player 2 is keeping 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5 for themselves. This translates to:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 68 = 0\n    *   8 units of item 2: 8 * 69 = 552\n    *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 10 = 50\n    *   6 units of item 4: 6 * 31 = 186\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 47 = 0\n    *   Total value of the current offer: 0 + 552 + 50 + 186 + 0 = 788\n    *   Discounted value of the current offer: 788 * 0.9 = 709.2\n\n*   **Comparing to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (709.2) is less than my outside offer value of 948. Therefore, I should not accept it as it stands.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since it's round 2, and if I propose a counteroffer, Player 2 could counter again or walk away. To avoid walking away in the next round, I need to ensure that Player 2 also has a valuable outcome. I will need to offer them more items that I do not value very much.\nI need to get a value greater than 948/0.9=1053.33, so ideally, I would maximize my gains from the items I value most.\n\nLet's consider an offer that tries to take all the items I value the most and leave a fair number of the other items to them.  I will propose to take: 4 item 1, 8 item 2, 1 item 3, 0 item 4, 3 item 5, leaving the other player 0, 0, 4, 6, 0.\n  *   4 units of item 1: 4 * 68 = 272\n    *   8 units of item 2: 8 * 69 = 552\n    *   1 units of item 3: 1 * 10 = 10\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 31 = 0\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 47 = 141\n  * Total value: 272 + 552 + 10 + 0 + 141 = 975\n    * Discounted value: 975 * 0.9 = 877.5. This is still less than my outside offer, so I will not propose this one.\n\nLet's try taking the majority of the valuable ones for myself and see if I can get close enough to my goal. I will propose to keep for myself 4 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 3 of item 5. This would give me:\n    * 4 units of item 1: 4 * 68 = 272\n    * 5 units of item 2: 5 * 69 = 345\n    * 0 units of item 3: 0 * 10 = 0\n    * 0 units of item 4: 0 * 31 = 0\n    * 3 units of item 5: 3 * 47 = 141\n   Total value: 272 + 345 + 0 + 0 + 141 = 758\n   Discounted Value: 758 * 0.9 = 682.2\n   I would be offering Player 2: 0, 3, 5, 6, 0. This is not a good deal for me.\n\nSince I need to give Player 2 more value I should let them have items I value less. I will propose that I take all item 1, all of item 2, no item 3, no item 4, and all item 5 which means I propose to offer player 2: 0, 0, 5, 6, 0\n\n    *  4 units of item 1: 4 * 68 = 272\n    *  8 units of item 2: 8 * 69 = 552\n    *  0 units of item 3: 0 * 10 = 0\n    *  0 units of item 4: 0 * 31 = 0\n    *  3 units of item 5: 3 * 47 = 141\n    Total value: 272 + 552 + 0 + 0 + 141 = 965\n    Discounted value: 965 * 0.9 = 868.5 which is less than 948.\n\nLet's try a different approach. I will propose to take 4 of item 1, 7 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 3 of item 5. This means I would offer the other player 0,1,5,6,0\n  *   4 units of item 1: 4 * 68 = 272\n  *   7 units of item 2: 7 * 69 = 483\n  *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 10 = 0\n  *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 31 = 0\n  *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 47 = 141\n  *   Total value: 272 + 483 + 0 + 0 + 141 = 896\n  * Discounted value: 896 * 0.9 = 806.4 which is also less than 948\n\nI think the best thing to do here is to take my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is not good enough. I cannot propose a counteroffer that will provide me with a value higher than my outside offer. I will walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1323\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 22\n    *   Item 2: 75\n    *   Item 3: 79\n    *   Item 4: 45\n    *   Item 5: 79\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4\n    *   Item 2: 6\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 6\n    *   Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [2, 3, 2, 3, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 22 = 44\n    *   3 units of item 2 = 3 * 75 = 225\n    *   2 units of item 3 = 2 * 79 = 158\n    *   3 units of item 4 = 3 * 45 = 135\n    *   2 units of item 5 = 2 * 79 = 158\n    *   Total value of current offer: 44 + 225 + 158 + 135 + 158 = 722\n    *   Discounted value: 722 * 0.9 = 649.8\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer that would give me more of the high-value items, item 2, 3 and 5. The current offer of [2,3,2,3,2] is quite poor given my valuations, so I'll start with this and see what happens.\n    Let's try offering Player 2: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n    This implies I get:\n    *   3 units of item 1 = 3 * 22 = 66\n    *   5 units of item 2 = 5 * 75 = 375\n    *   4 units of item 3 = 4 * 79 = 316\n    *   5 units of item 4 = 5 * 45 = 225\n    *   3 units of item 5 = 3 * 79 = 237\n    *   Total value = 66 + 375 + 316 + 225 + 237 = 1219\n    * This isn't good enough, it is below my walkaway.\n    \n    Let's try to maximize my return whilst not being completely greedy by trying to claim all of the high-value items. Let's try offering them [1, 2, 1, 3, 1]:\n    This implies I get:\n    *   3 units of item 1 = 3 * 22 = 66\n    *   4 units of item 2 = 4 * 75 = 300\n    *   4 units of item 3 = 4 * 79 = 316\n    *   3 units of item 4 = 3 * 45 = 135\n    *   3 units of item 5 = 3 * 79 = 237\n    *   Total value = 66 + 300 + 316 + 135 + 237 = 1054\n    * This discounted value is 1054 * 0.9 = 948.6.\n\n    If I offered [0,0,0,0,0], then I would receive \n    * 4 * 22 + 6 * 75 + 5 * 79 + 6 * 45 + 4* 79 = 88 + 450 + 395 + 270 + 316 = 1519\n    * Discounted value: 1519 * 0.9 = 1367.1\n    * This is above my outside offer. Let's try it.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    * The current offer is worth 649.8, which is far below my outside offer of 1323.\n    * The example counter offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] yields 1219, which when discounted is 1097.1. Still not high enough.\n    * The example counter offer [1, 2, 1, 3, 1] yields 1054, discounted is 948.6. Still not high enough.\n    * The counter offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] yields 1519, which when discounted is 1367.1. This is higher than my walkaway.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is well below my outside offer, therefore, I should reject.\n*   My counteroffer of [0,0,0,0,0] gives a higher value than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore I should make the counteroffer that gives me all the items, to player 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Since we are in round 2, the discount factor will be gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9. This means any deal we make in round 2 will be worth 90% of its undiscounted value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 units of every item, which has a total undiscounted value of 0 * 54 + 0 * 99 + 0 * 76 + 0 * 55 + 0 * 4 = 0.  The discounted value is also 0 * 0.9 = 0.\n*  **Value of previous counteroffer:** My previous counteroffer gave player 1 [2,3,2,3,2] meaning I would keep [2, 3, 3, 3, 2].  That has a value to me of 2*54 + 3*99 + 3*76 + 3*55 + 2*4 = 108 + 297 + 228 + 165 + 8 = 806.  The value of this offer in round 1 was 806*1 = 806.  In round two if this was the accepted offer it would be worth 806 * 0.9 = 725.4\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I could make various counteroffers. Let's consider a few:\n    * I will need to keep enough items to at least match my outside offer. I know I was happy with [2,3,3,3,2] in the last round which was worth 806.  If I receive 0 of everything, then I need to counter offer. I should try to offer something more favorable to me but still more than the current offer.  Let's offer player 1 half of each of the items (rounding down) which means I keep the rest:\n          Player 1 gets [2,3,2,3,2], I keep [2,3,3,3,2] for a value of 806\n      * If I make a counteroffer I get a deal worth 806 * 0.9 = 725.4\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is 796.  Since all of my potential counteroffers are worth less than my outside offer it is better to walk away.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of [0,0,0,0,0] has a value of 0, which is much worse than my outside offer of 796. Any potential offer, even the ones I considered from round 1, after the discount factor in round 2, are still worth less than my outside offer. Therefore, it is in my best interest to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

Let's consider a few options.\n\n    *   **Option 1:  Offer Player 2 a minimal amount of each item.** Let's try offering 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n        *   My value:\n            *   Item 1: 2 * 20 = 40\n            *   Item 2: 3 * 20 = 60\n            *   Item 3: 6 * 97 = 582\n            *   Item 4: 2 * 44 = 88\n            *   Item 5: 3 * 73 = 219\n            *  Total: 989\n\n    *   **Option 2:  Offer Player 2 a more generous amount.** Let's try offering 1 unit of item 1, 2 unit of item 2, 3 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 unit of item 5\n        *   My value:\n            *   Item 1: 1 * 20 = 20\n            *   Item 2: 2 * 20 = 40\n            *   Item 3: 4 * 97 = 388\n            *   Item 4: 1 * 44 = 44\n            *   Item 5: 2 * 73 = 146\n            *  Total: 638\n   \n    *   **Option 3:  Offer Player 2 half or slightly less of the total items, more evenly** Let's try offering 1 unit of item 1, 2 unit of item 2, 3 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 unit of item 5. (Same as option 2, let's calculate it differently for thoroughness)\n        *   My Value:\n            *   Item 1: 1 * 20 = 20\n            *   Item 2: 2 * 20 = 40\n            *   Item 3: 4 * 97 = 388\n            *   Item 4: 1 * 44 = 44\n            *   Item 5: 2 * 73 = 146\n            *   Total = 638\n        \n    I can keep comparing and creating new offers but for efficiency sake, let's evaluate the previous options. Option 1 gives me the highest total value at 989. I will select Option 1 and submit the counteroffer.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Option 1: 989 > 118\n    *   Option 2/3: 638 > 118\n    All of these options are better than my outside offer, but Option 1 provides me with the highest value.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept any current offer because there isn't one.\n*   I should not walk away because all my potential counter offers are above my outside offer.\n*   I will propose my counteroffer of Option 1 (offer Player 2 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5)\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

This means that any outcome in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the nominal value and any outcome in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the nominal value to me.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This means I receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 32 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 36 = 36\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 99 = 99\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 21 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 50 = 50\n    *   Total value of current offer: 0 + 36 + 99 + 0 + 50 = 185\n   \n    *   Since this is round 1, the value is 185 * 0.9^(1-1) = 185 * 1 = 185\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would keep for myself and calculate the value. It may be useful to calculate the maximum possible offer to see if accepting the current offer is better.\n    * If I kept all items, my value would be: 2 * 32 + 4 * 36 + 7 * 99 + 2 * 21 + 4 * 50 = 64 + 144 + 693 + 42 + 200 = 1143\n    *If I gave Player 1 1 of each item, I would get: 1 * 32 + 3 * 36 + 6 * 99 + 1 * 21 + 3 * 50 = 32 + 108 + 594 + 21 + 150 = 905\n\n    *   A more reasonable counteroffer would be one that gives me enough value to surpass my outside offer of 1063, discounted if necessary. For example, to get a better outcome that is similar to the split above, If I gave Player 1 [0, 1, 1, 0, 1] and kept the rest, that would leave me with:\n    * 2 of item 1: 2 * 32 = 64\n    * 3 of item 2: 3 * 36 = 108\n    * 6 of item 3: 6 * 99 = 594\n    * 2 of item 4: 2 * 21 = 42\n    * 3 of item 5: 3 * 50 = 150\n     Total value 958\n     If instead, I gave player 1 [0,0,0,0,0], then my value will be 1143.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Current offer (185) is significantly less than my outside offer (1063).\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is very low compared to my outside offer.\n*   Making a counteroffer is better than accepting the current offer, since I can offer more to player 1.\n*   I want to offer something that is likely to be accepted to make the deal happen in this round since I want to avoid discounting.\n*   I will start with an offer that would still give me more value than my outside offer. I will try to get at least 90% of the total value in this round.\n    * I want to keep a total value of at least 1063. The value at the end of this round would be the value if the offer was accepted so I need to give the other player items worth less than 1143 - 1063 = 80, which is very little value. I'll try giving Player 1 [0,0,0,0,0], which results in me getting everything and a value of 1143.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer that gives nothing to Player 1, but maximizes my profit.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This means that any deal reached in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times the actual value of the items, and any deal in round 3 will be 0.9^2 times the actual value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer on the table is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I receive nothing. My value if I accept this offer is 0.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate a potential counteroffer that gives me more than my outside offer. I want to maximize my value while being realistic about what Player 2 might accept. Let's consider a counteroffer that takes most of the high value items, and gives player 2 most of the low value items. Given previous offers, it's unlikely Player 2 will accept an offer of 0 for everything.\nLet's try offering player 2 one unit of each of item 1, 2, 4 and 5 and two units of item 3. This means I will keep 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 3 units of item 5.\n    *   My value:\n        *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 20 = 20\n        *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 20 = 60\n        *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 97 = 485\n        *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 44 = 44\n        *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 73 = 219\n        *   Total value = 20 + 60 + 485 + 44 + 219 = 828.\n       Discounted value: 828 * 0.9 = 745.2\n        \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is 118. The discounted value of my potential counteroffer is 745.2 which is much larger than the outside offer value. Therefore it makes sense to make a counteroffer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable as it gives me a value of 0. Walking away is also not a good move since there is potential to achieve a higher value. Since my outside offer is 118, I need to find an offer that returns a higher value. The offer of one each of item 1,2,4,5 and two units of item 3, provides me with a substantial return and, I believe, is a reasonable counter offer that Player 2 might accept.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1063\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 32\n    *   Item 2: 36\n    *   Item 3: 99\n    *   Item 4: 21\n    *   Item 5: 50\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 7\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9 if we make a deal this round, and 0.9^2 = 0.81 if we make a deal next round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]. This means they are giving me:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 32 = 32\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 36 = 36\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 99 = 198\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 21 = 21\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 50 = 50\n    *   Total value of current offer: 32 + 36 + 198 + 21 + 50 = 337\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 337 * 0.9 = 303.3\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer where I try to get at least the value I want based on outside offer, remembering that there is a discount: 1063/0.9 = 1181.11.  Because it's round 2, I should ask for what I would ask for at round 1 adjusted for discounting, but I don't know Player 1's values.\n    Since they offered me one of each on items 1, 2, 4, 5, and 2 of item 3, they likely value those highly. I will try to get much more of Item 3 and a decent amount of the others, while leaving them enough to accept. The remaining items I have are: item 1: 1, item 2: 3, item 3: 5, item 4: 1, item 5: 3.\nLet's see what offer is approximately equivalent to my outside offer. I want a value of 1181. If we try to take as much of item 3 as we can, at 99/unit, 5 * 99 = 495. \n1181-495 = 686 remaining. \nIf I take all of my 3 units of item 2, that's 3*36=108, 686-108=578 remaining.\nIf I take all of my 3 units of item 5, that's 3*50=150, 578-150=428 remaining.\nIf I take 1 unit of item 1, that's 32, 428-32=396\nIf I take 1 unit of item 4, that's 21, 396-21=375 remaining.\nSo, to get what I need, I should propose [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] back to them. No, that is the current offer.\nMaybe try to get most of what I can out of Item 3.\nIf I offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] to them, then my value would be:\n Item 1: 2 * 32 = 64\n Item 2: 3 * 36 = 108\n Item 3: 7 * 99 = 693\n Item 4: 2 * 21 = 42\n Item 5: 3 * 50 = 150\n Total: 1057 * 0.9 = 951.3\n Let's try an offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] to player 1:\n\n    *   Item 1: 2 * 32 = 64\n    *   Item 2: 4 * 36 = 144\n    *   Item 3: 6 * 99 = 594\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 21 = 42\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 50 = 200\n    *   Total = 1044. Discounted = 1044*0.9 = 939.6\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's discounted value (303.3) is much lower than my outside offer (1063). The offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] has value of 939.6 which is also significantly worse than my outside offer value.\nLet's try to offer player one 0 of everything except 1 unit of item 1: [1,0,0,0,0]\nMy total value would be:\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 32 = 32\n    *   Item 2: 4 * 36 = 144\n    *   Item 3: 7 * 99 = 693\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 21 = 42\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 50 = 200\n    *   Total = 1111\n    * Discounted total: 1111 * 0.9 = 999.9\nStill not quite as good.\nLet's try offering 0 on items 1, 2, and 4, and 1 on 3 and 5: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nValue to me is:\n    * Item 1: 2 * 32 = 64\n    * Item 2: 4 * 36 = 144\n    * Item 3: 6 * 99 = 594\n    * Item 4: 2 * 21 = 42\n    * Item 5: 3 * 50 = 150\n Total: 994\nDiscounted Total: 994 * 0.9 = 894.6\n\nSince the current offer is so low and I want a value close to my outside offer to account for the discount, I will counter. Because the game will end on my next turn, the only way to get my outside offer value (or something close to it) is to offer something they will accept. It appears they value the things they gave me. So I'm going to offer them what remains from my best counteroffer above [0, 0, 1, 0, 1].\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nI should not accept the current offer, since its discounted value (303.3) is much lower than my outside offer value (1063). I will make the counteroffer [0, 0, 1, 0, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

I should aim to make an offer that Player 2 will likely accept, but still gives me significant value.  Let's consider a few options. I want to make an offer that is higher than my outside offer of 231. I want to keep most of my high value items. If I give Player 2 2 items of value 1, 1 item of value 2, 1 item of value 3, 1 item of value 4 and 1 item of value 5 I am offering the following, with my total value being calculated as follows:\n    * 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 53 = 159\n    * 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 10 = 20\n    * 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 12 = 24\n    * 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 1 = 3\n    * 2 units of item 5 = 2 * 74 = 148\n    Total value = 354.\n    This is higher than my outside value so is a reasonable starting point.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is 231.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 556. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 837 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 556. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Values of the items:**\n    *   Item 1: 68\n    *   Item 2: 100\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 25\n    *   Item 5: 83\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 90% of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 81% of a deal in round 1. So, there is a penalty for delaying a deal.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would get:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units * 68 = 136\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit * 100 = 100\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit * 3 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit * 25 = 25\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit * 83 = 83\n    *   **Total value of current offer:** 136 + 100 + 3 + 25 + 83 = 347.\n\n    The value of the current offer is 347, and this is less than my outside offer value of 556.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    Let's calculate the value of a potential counteroffer to ensure the value is higher than my outside offer. I would prefer to keep the items that I value more. If I were to offer the other player 1 of each item, and take the rest, I would have:\n    *   Item 1: 4 units * 68 = 272\n    *   Item 2: 2 units * 100 = 200\n    *   Item 3: 2 units * 3 = 6\n    *   Item 4: 3 units * 25 = 75\n    *   Item 5: 2 units * 83 = 166\n    *   **Total value of this counter offer to me:** 272 + 200 + 6 + 75 + 166 = 719\n\n    This value of 719 is far greater than the outside offer of 556. I think a counteroffer like this might be accepted by Player 1 as it provides them a fair share.\n    Another possibility would be:\n    *  Item 1: 0 units * 68 = 0\n    *  Item 2: 0 units * 100 = 0\n    *  Item 3: 0 units * 3 = 0\n    *  Item 4: 0 units * 25 = 0\n    *  Item 5: 0 units * 83 = 0\n    \n    This would give me the total value of 998 and would be the best deal for me, if the other player accepted it.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    The current offer (347) is much lower than my outside offer (556), so I should not accept it. Counteroffering will give me a chance to get better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should NOT accept the current offer since it is worse than my outside offer.\n*   I should NOT walk away and take my outside offer, since I can improve my value.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer to Player 1 offering them 1 unit of each item.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

The best option is to consider maximizing my value. Given the previous offer from Player 1, I could try to capture more value. I will start with the same amounts as I offered in round 1, but increase item 5, since this is where the majority of my value is.\n\nLet's evaluate a potential counteroffer [2,1,1,1,2]:\n    *   Item 1: 3 units * 53 = 159\n    *   Item 2: 2 units * 10 = 20\n    *   Item 3: 2 units * 12 = 24\n    *   Item 4: 3 units * 1 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit * 74 = 74\n    *   Total value = 159 + 20 + 24 + 3 + 74 = 280\n    *  Discounted value = 280 * 0.9 = 252\n* Let's evaluate a potential counteroffer [1,0,0,0,0] (keeping 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4 and 3 of item 5).\n    * Item 1: 4 units * 53 = 212\n    * Item 2: 3 units * 10 = 30\n    * Item 3: 3 units * 12 = 36\n    * Item 4: 4 units * 1 = 4\n    * Item 5: 3 units * 74 = 222\n    * Total Value = 212 + 30 + 36 + 4 + 222 = 504\n    * Discounted Value = 504 * 0.9 = 453.6\n\nThis offer is the most desirable so far.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] has a value of 135, while my outside offer is 231.

I can consider potential outcomes for giving them 0 of everything, giving them all of everything, and anything between. I must consider if the value to me is better than my outside offer value of 231, or my current discounted offer value of 121.5, and what is also relevant, is that it will be my last action and it will be discounted by 0.81.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** If I walk away, I get 231. The current discounted offer is worth 121.5.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\nSince this is the final round, we only consider the discounted offer value of 121.5, and my outside offer of 231. We should be trying to maximize our own value at this point. Any counteroffer will result in the same value as walking away. Since 231 > 121.5, it is better to walk away.\n\n**Final Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

In round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I'm Player 1 and it's the first round, I'm making the initial offer. I want to maximize my value, but also leave the other player with enough to not walk away. A reasonable starting point might be to offer Player 2 approximately half of the items, but I should keep more of the items that I value more. Here's an offer I will evaluate:\n    *   Item 1: Offer Player 2 = 2 units. Keep 3 units.\n    *   Item 2: Offer Player 2 = 3 units. Keep 3 units.\n    *   Item 3: Offer Player 2 = 1 unit. Keep 1 unit.\n    *   Item 4: Offer Player 2 = 2 units. Keep 3 units.\n    *   Item 5: Offer Player 2 = 3 units. Keep 3 units.\n\n     My value for this division is:\n    *   Item 1: 3 * 73 = 219\n    *   Item 2: 3 * 56 = 168\n    *   Item 3: 1 * 56 = 56\n    *   Item 4: 3 * 46 = 138\n    *   Item 5: 3 * 78 = 234\n    *   Total value = 219 + 168 + 56 + 138 + 234 = 815.\n\n    This offer gives me value of 815, which is less than my outside offer of 1501. Therefore I should adjust it. I should aim to keep more of the higher-value items. Here is a new offer for Player 2 to evaluate:\n    *   Item 1: Offer Player 2 = 1 unit. Keep 4 units.\n    *   Item 2: Offer Player 2 = 2 unit. Keep 4 units.\n    *   Item 3: Offer Player 2 = 0 unit. Keep 2 units.\n    *   Item 4: Offer Player 2 = 1 unit. Keep 4 units.\n    *   Item 5: Offer Player 2 = 2 unit. Keep 4 units.\n\n     My value for this division is:\n    *   Item 1: 4 * 73 = 292\n    *   Item 2: 4 * 56 = 224\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 56 = 112\n    *   Item 4: 4 * 46 = 184\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 78 = 312\n    *   Total value = 292 + 224 + 112 + 184 + 312 = 1124.\n\n     This total value is still less than my outside offer. It makes sense that an equal distribution of items will result in lower value to me than my outside offer. Therefore I need to make a much more aggressive offer to try to get more value. Here is a new offer for Player 2 to evaluate:\n     *  Item 1: Offer Player 2 = 0 units. Keep 5 units\n     *  Item 2: Offer Player 2 = 1 unit. Keep 5 units\n     *  Item 3: Offer Player 2 = 0 units. Keep 2 units\n     *  Item 4: Offer Player 2 = 0 units. Keep 5 units\n     *  Item 5: Offer Player 2 = 1 unit. Keep 5 units\n\n      My value for this division is:\n    *   Item 1: 5 * 73 = 365\n    *   Item 2: 5 * 56 = 280\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 56 = 112\n    *   Item 4: 5 * 46 = 230\n    *   Item 5: 5 * 78 = 390\n    *   Total value = 365 + 280 + 112 + 230 + 390 = 1377.\n\n    This total value is still less than my outside offer. However, I will propose this as my offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI should propose the following counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1228. This is my guaranteed fallback value if negotiations fail.\n*   **My item values:** 74 for item 1, 92 for item 2, 40 for item 3, 27 for item 4, 72 for item 5.\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting a deal in later rounds is worth less than accepting the same deal in earlier rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 74 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 92 = 92\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 40 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 27 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 72 = 72\n    *   Total value from current offer: 0 + 92 + 0 + 0 + 72 = 164\n*   **Comparing to outside offer:** 164 is significantly less than my outside offer of 1228.  It is not beneficial to accept this offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate the value of the items I would keep and propose the other player's share of items as a counteroffer.  My current item holdings are 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4 and 6 units of item 5.\n    Since I have the right to propose the share for Player 1, and it will take a lot of calculations to determine a value maximizing distribution, it is better to offer a very favorable counteroffer to see if Player 1 is willing to accept a large discount to avoid a walk, and then to negotiate later if required.\n    I will offer player 1 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 unit of item 4 and 3 units of item 5. This leaves me with 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5.\n    Value of counteroffer to me:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 74 = 148\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 92 = 276\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 40 = 40\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 27 = 81\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 72 = 216\n    *   Total value of this counter offer: 148 + 276 + 40 + 81 + 216 = 761\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is very bad because it yields a value of 164 which is much less than my outside offer of 1228.\n*   Walking away gives me 1228.\n*   A counteroffer of 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5 yields a value of 761. This is better than accepting the current offer of 164, but worse than the outside offer. However, there is still two rounds of negotiation left, therefore I will make a counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 1, 2, 3]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

As we know nothing about the values of Player 2, we'll consider a fair split as our opening offer. \n    *   Fair Split: \n        * Give Player 2 half of item 1: 2 units (keep 2)\n        * Give Player 2 half of item 2: 2 units (keep 3)\n        * Give Player 2 half of item 3: 1 unit (keep 1)\n        * Give Player 2 half of item 4: 4 units (keep 4)\n        * Give Player 2 half of item 5: 3 units (keep 4)\n\n        Value to me:\n        *  2 * 20 + 3 * 41 + 1 * 94 + 4 * 67 + 4 * 48 = 40 + 123 + 94 + 268 + 192 = 717\n        \n        This would mean giving the other player [2,2,1,4,3].\n\n    * Another possible offer is to give the other player less than half but more than nothing.\n       *Give Player 2 the following allocation:\n           *Give player 2, 1 unit of item 1 (keep 3)\n           *Give player 2, 2 units of item 2 (keep 3)\n           *Give player 2, 0 units of item 3 (keep 2)\n           *Give player 2, 3 units of item 4 (keep 5)\n           *Give player 2, 2 units of item 5 (keep 5)\n\n           Value to me:\n           * 3 * 20 + 3 * 41 + 2 * 94 + 5 * 67 + 5 * 48 = 60 + 123 + 188 + 335 + 240 = 946\n       \n       This means offering the other player [1,2,0,3,2].\n\n    * We must also consider an offer to give away nothing. \n       *Give Player 2 the following allocation:\n           *Give player 2, 0 units of item 1 (keep 4)\n           *Give player 2, 0 units of item 2 (keep 5)\n           *Give player 2, 0 units of item 3 (keep 2)\n           *Give player 2, 0 units of item 4 (keep 8)\n           *Give player 2, 0 units of item 5 (keep 7)\n\n           Value to me:\n           * 4 * 20 + 5 * 41 + 2 * 94 + 8 * 67 + 7 * 48 = 80 + 205 + 188 + 536 + 336 = 1345\n           \n           This means offering the other player [0,0,0,0,0].\n        \n    All these offers are better than the outside offer of 549. However, it is unlikely Player 2 will accept [0,0,0,0,0]. We should start with the fair offer, and then be ready to negotiate if required.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nBased on this analysis, it is best to start with a reasonable offer, and see the reaction of the other player. The other player has unknown values, so we should assume a reasonable level of rationality and assume they would not accept a proposal where they got nothing. A fair division will maximize the chances of getting a positive deal in round 1, which is the best outcome given the discount factor.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 4, 3]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 15.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 49\n    *   Item 2: 76\n    *   Item 3: 86\n    *   Item 4: 39\n    *   Item 5: 7\n*   **Total Item Pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 8 units\n    *   Item 5: 7 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that any deal made in later rounds is worth less than the same deal made now. A deal made in round 2 would be worth 0.9 times its face value, and a deal made in round 3 would be worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer gives me [2, 2, 1, 4, 3]. This means I receive:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 49 = 98\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 76 = 152\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 86 = 86\n    *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 39 = 156\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 7 = 21\n    *   Total value of current offer: 98 + 152 + 86 + 156 + 21 = 513\n    Since this is round 1, the discount factor does not come into play, so the current value is 513.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's think about a counteroffer that would be beneficial to me. I want to maximize my value. Since player 1 has offered me some of all of each item, I should make a counteroffer where I get the best items. Let me calculate the value of a potential offer of [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]:\n      * I receive:\n            *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 49 = 147\n            *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 76 = 304\n            *   2 unit of item 3: 2 * 86 = 172\n            *   8 units of item 4: 8 * 39 = 312\n            *   7 unit of item 5: 7 * 7 = 49\n        Total: 147 + 304 + 172 + 312 + 49 = 984.  \n        This is a very high value outcome for me, and also probably too greedy to be accepted by the other player, so I won't go with this.\n    How about a counteroffer where I get most items except item 5? That would be offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]. This gives me:\n    *  3 units of item 1: 3 * 49 = 147\n    *  4 units of item 2: 4 * 76 = 304\n    *  1 units of item 3: 1 * 86 = 86\n    *  7 units of item 4: 7 * 39 = 273\n    *  4 units of item 5: 4 * 7 = 28\n    Total value = 147 + 304 + 86 + 273 + 28 = 838. This would be better for me than accepting the current offer.\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer is worth 513 which is significantly greater than my outside offer value of 15. I should not walk away.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 513, which is significantly better than my outside option. I can try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer. I will offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 4, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 1, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 15.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 49\n    *   Item 2: 76\n    *   Item 3: 86\n    *   Item 4: 39\n    *   Item 5: 7\n*   **Total item pool:** There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, and 7 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. Since this is round 2, any deal will be discounted by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [2, 2, 1, 2, 3], meaning I receive 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.  This means that I keep for myself the following units: 4-2=2 of item 1, 5-2=3 of item 2, 2-1=1 of item 3, 8-2=6 of item 4 and 7-3=4 of item 5. \n    *   Value of items kept = (2 * 49) + (3 * 76) + (1 * 86) + (6 * 39) + (4 * 7) = 98 + 228 + 86 + 234 + 28 = 674\n    *   Discounted value of accepting the current offer: 674 * 0.9 = 606.6\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    *   I need to consider that I am in round 2 of 3, so I am less willing to wait than in round 1.\n    *   An offer that would give me the most items would be to offer player 1 the smallest possible amount: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This would give me a value of (4 * 49) + (5 * 76) + (2 * 86) + (8 * 39) + (7 * 7) = 196 + 380 + 172 + 312 + 49 = 1109, with a discounted value of 1109 * 0.9 = 998.1\n    *   Another possible counteroffer would be to ask for at least half of each item. I have an outside offer of only 15, so I don't want to ask for too little. \n    I could offer player 1 the following: [2, 2, 1, 4, 3]. This is the same as their last offer to me and would leave me with\n    (2 * 49) + (3 * 76) + (1 * 86) + (4 * 39) + (4 * 7) = 98 + 228 + 86 + 156 + 28 = 596. A discounted value of 596 * 0.9 = 536.4. This value is still very high, especially compared to my outside offer.\n    *    I should probably aim for something that's close to the halfway mark but also slightly more generous to myself. I could try to be greedy and offer: [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]. This leaves me with: \n    (3 * 49) + (4 * 76) + (2 * 86) + (7 * 39) + (5 * 7) = 147 + 304 + 172 + 273 + 35 = 931, with a discounted value of 931 * 0.9 = 837.9. I think I will go with this offer.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is 15. Accepting the current offer gives me a discounted value of 606.6. My greedy counteroffer gives me a discounted value of 837.9.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is better than walking away and getting my outside offer of 15.\n*   However, a greedy counteroffer is much better than accepting the current offer, so I will make a counteroffer.\n*  Since this is the second round, I will make the greedy offer and give the player what they have been pushing for.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 5, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 5, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

In round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. In later rounds, the discount will reduce the present value of any agreement.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 3, 5, 1]. This means they would get the remaining items: [2, 1, 3, 6, 2]. The value to me is:\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 41 = 41\n    *   Item 2: 1 * 19 = 19\n    *   Item 3: 3 * 96 = 288\n    *   Item 4: 5 * 76 = 380\n    *   Item 5: 1 * 71 = 71\n    *   Total value = 41 + 19 + 288 + 380 + 71 = 799\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I could make various counteroffers. However, given the current offer I should see if there is a significantly better offer I could make. If the current offer is better than my outside offer, and there are no significantly better offers, then I should simply accept.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My current offer is 799, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 201.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of 799 is far better than my outside offer of 201.  If I were to make a counteroffer, I would lose the benefits of accepting this offer due to the discount rate in future rounds.\n\nTherefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

If we reject the deal now it is worth 747 * 1, whereas if we get to a deal next round it will be worth 747 * 0.9 = 672.3. Therefore we will only walk away in round 2 if there is no deal worth at least 672.3. In round 3, we need at least 747 * 0.81 = 605.\nLet's create a more even counteroffer instead.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2:\n*   2 unit of item 1\n*   1 unit of item 2\n*   1 unit of item 3\n*   2 unit of item 4\n*   2 unit of item 5\n\nThis would leave me with:\n*   3 unit of item 1\n*   2 unit of item 2\n*   1 unit of item 3\n*   3 unit of item 4\n*   2 unit of item 5\n\nMy value for this counteroffer is:\n* 3 * 64 + 2 * 12 + 1 * 87 + 3 * 2 + 2 * 62 = 192 + 24 + 87 + 6 + 124 = 433\n\nThis is still below my outside offer.\n\nLet's instead try an offer that aims to give the other player as little value as possible, making it more likely to be accepted:\n\nLet's try offering Player 2:\n*   0 unit of item 1\n*   0 unit of item 2\n*   0 unit of item 3\n*   0 unit of item 4\n*   0 unit of item 5\n\nThis would leave me with:\n*   5 unit of item 1\n*   3 unit of item 2\n*   2 unit of item 3\n*   5 unit of item 4\n*   4 unit of item 5\n\nMy value for this counteroffer is:\n* 5 * 64 + 3 * 12 + 2 * 87 + 5 * 2 + 4 * 62 = 320 + 36 + 174 + 10 + 248 = 788\n\n788 is greater than my outside offer of 747 so I want to avoid walking at this round.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince no offer is currently on the table, I will propose the offer above which yields me the maximal value if accepted.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This results in a total value of 0. This is far below my outside offer value of 435.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few scenarios for counteroffers, where I propose to give the following to Player 1, while keeping the rest:\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** Giving the other player 1 of each item\n        * My items: [4, 2, 1, 4, 3]\n        * Value: (4 * 74) + (2 * 35) + (1 * 28) + (4 * 6) + (3 * 4) = 296 + 70 + 28 + 24 + 12 = 430.\n        \n    *   **Counteroffer 2:** Giving the other player 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 4, 1 of item 5. This means I'd keep the remaining items: [3,2,2,4,3].\n         * My items: [3, 2, 2, 4, 3]\n        * Value: (3 * 74) + (2 * 35) + (2 * 28) + (4 * 6) + (3 * 4) = 222 + 70 + 56 + 24 + 12 = 384\n    *   **Counteroffer 3:** Giving the other player 0 of all items (keeping everything).\n        *My items: [5,3,2,5,4]\n        *Value: (5 * 74) + (3 * 35) + (2 * 28) + (5 * 6) + (4 * 4) = 370+105+56+30+16 = 577\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer value is 435. The only one of the counter offers that results in a value above my outside offer value is if I keep everything. Counteroffer 1 (keeping 4,2,1,4,3) is slightly below it at 430. It is early in the game, so it is not unreasonable to make an initial offer that is highly in my favor, knowing the negotiation may go over more rounds.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is unacceptable since it offers me nothing.\n*   Walking away is a possible option but not the most rational since I have room for negotiation.\n*   Counteroffer 3 is very good for me (577), but it might be rejected by player 1 immediately (since it offers them nothing). But, I'm not giving up value by making this offer, as my outside option is 435 and not my total value of items, so I should start negotiations with the offer that is the best for me to test player 1's intentions.\n\nTherefore, I will propose a counteroffer that keeps everything.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 747. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best course of action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 747\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 64, Item 2: 12, Item 3: 87, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 62\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of Item 1, 3 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 5 units of Item 4, 4 units of Item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9. This means that any deal in this round will be worth 90% of its face value. A deal next round will be worth 81% of its face value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means I receive nothing. My value for accepting this offer is 0. This is way less than my outside offer, and we still need to consider the discount factor, 0 * 0.9 = 0.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to maximize my value, which means I want to keep as many of the high-value items as possible (Items 1, 3, and 5) while giving away low-value items (Items 2 and 4) to make a deal likely. A deal must give both players better than their outside offer, adjusted for the discount rate.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that is fairly aggressive towards me, but provides more value to Player 2 than their current offer. Let's give away half of each item, when possible. We will give away:\n    * Item 1: 2 units\n    * Item 2: 1 unit\n    * Item 3: 1 unit\n    * Item 4: 2 units\n    * Item 5: 2 units.\nThis gives Player 2 [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]. My remaining value is:\n    * Item 1: 3 units * 64 = 192\n    * Item 2: 2 units * 12 = 24\n    * Item 3: 1 unit * 87 = 87\n    * Item 4: 3 units * 2 = 6\n    * Item 5: 2 unit * 62 = 124\n    Total value = 192 + 24 + 87 + 6 + 124 = 433\n    Applying the discount factor, the value is 433 * 0.9 = 389.7, still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that is less aggressive, but gives more value to Player 2 than the previous counteroffer. Let's offer them only low value items and give a larger portion. Let's give away:\n    * Item 1: 0 units\n    * Item 2: 2 unit\n    * Item 3: 0 unit\n    * Item 4: 4 units\n    * Item 5: 0 units.\nThis gives Player 2 [0, 2, 0, 4, 0]. My remaining value is:\n    * Item 1: 5 units * 64 = 320\n    * Item 2: 1 units * 12 = 12\n    * Item 3: 2 unit * 87 = 174\n    * Item 4: 1 units * 2 = 2\n    * Item 5: 4 unit * 62 = 248\n    Total value = 320 + 12 + 174 + 2 + 248= 756\n    Applying the discount factor, the value is 756 * 0.9 = 680.4, still less than my outside offer.\n\nTo get an offer that is better than my outside offer, I need to try to hold on to most of the value. Let's give them the following, and see if it will provide player 2 with enough value to not walk away. Let's give away:\n    * Item 1: 0 units\n    * Item 2: 1 unit\n    * Item 3: 0 unit\n    * Item 4: 3 units\n    * Item 5: 0 units.\nThis gives Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]. My remaining value is:\n    * Item 1: 5 units * 64 = 320\n    * Item 2: 2 units * 12 = 24\n    * Item 3: 2 unit * 87 = 174\n    * Item 4: 2 units * 2 = 4\n    * Item 5: 4 unit * 62 = 248\n    Total value = 320 + 24 + 174 + 4 + 248 = 768\n    Applying the discount factor, the value is 768 * 0.9 = 691.2, still less than my outside offer.\n\nI have made a number of offers that provide more than 0 value, but are still worth less than my outside offer even with the discount. If I walk away, I get 747. Since this is round 2, I would rather walk away than accept something of less value.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince any counteroffer I can devise will be worth less than my outside offer, adjusted for the discount, the best action is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine my action for round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 658\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 18\n    *   Item 2: 27\n    *   Item 3: 16\n    *   Item 4: 47\n    *   Item 5: 43\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 6 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal reached in a later round will be worth less to me than a deal reached in an earlier round. Specifically, in round 2, the value of the deal will be multiplied by 0.9, and in round 3, it will be multiplied by 0.81. This encourages me to try to reach a deal sooner, but I won't accept a deal worse than my outside offer.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since there is no current offer, I will make the first offer. I need to propose a counteroffer that I think might be acceptable to the other player (while also trying to maximize my own value). A good starting point is an equal split, which would be:\n\n    * Item 1: I keep 1, give 2\n    * Item 2: I keep 3, give 3\n    * Item 3: I keep 3, give 3\n    * Item 4: I keep 2, give 3\n    * Item 5: I keep 1, give 2\n\n    Let's evaluate this counteroffer, which would give the following amounts to Player 2 :  [2, 3, 3, 3, 2].\n    * My items:\n        *  Item 1: 1 unit  * 18 = 18\n        *  Item 2: 3 units * 27 = 81\n        *  Item 3: 3 units * 16 = 48\n        *  Item 4: 2 units * 47 = 94\n        *  Item 5: 1 unit * 43 = 43\n        *  Total value = 18 + 81 + 48 + 94 + 43 = 284\n\n*  Let's evaluate another potential counteroffer with me keeping more items and giving less to player 2. I will propose that the other player receives the following items: [0, 2, 2, 1, 0].\n    * My items:\n        *  Item 1: 3 units * 18 = 54\n        *  Item 2: 4 units * 27 = 108\n        *  Item 3: 4 units * 16 = 64\n        *  Item 4: 4 units * 47 = 188\n        *  Item 5: 3 units * 43 = 129\n        *  Total value = 54 + 108 + 64 + 188 + 129 = 543\n\n*   How do these compare to my outside offer?:\n    The equal split offer has a value less than my outside offer, and it is very likely that it will be rejected by the other player. The second offer [0, 2, 2, 1, 0] will give me a value of 543 which is less than my outside offer value, making it a bad deal for me. So, I will propose an offer that gives the other player less than the equal split offer. Let's try the following offer: [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n        * My Items:\n            * Item 1: 2 units * 18 = 36\n            * Item 2: 4 units * 27 = 108\n            * Item 3: 4 units * 16 = 64\n            * Item 4: 3 units * 47 = 141\n            * Item 5: 2 units * 43 = 86\n            * Total value = 36 + 108 + 64 + 141 + 86 = 435. Still significantly below my outside option.\n\n    Let's try again, let's propose an offer that gives the other player [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n        * My Items:\n            * Item 1: 3 units * 18 = 54\n            * Item 2: 5 units * 27 = 135\n            * Item 3: 5 units * 16 = 80\n            * Item 4: 4 units * 47 = 188\n            * Item 5: 3 units * 43 = 129\n            * Total Value = 54 + 135 + 80 + 188 + 129 = 586\n\n    Let's try one more, lets propose an offer that gives the other player [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n        * My Items:\n            * Item 1: 3 units * 18 = 54\n            * Item 2: 6 units * 27 = 162\n            * Item 3: 5 units * 16 = 80\n            * Item 4: 4 units * 47 = 188\n            * Item 5: 3 units * 43 = 129\n            * Total Value = 54 + 162 + 80 + 188 + 129 = 613.\n\nLet's try an offer that gives the other player [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n        * My Items:\n            * Item 1: 3 units * 18 = 54\n            * Item 2: 6 units * 27 = 162\n            * Item 3: 6 units * 16 = 96\n            * Item 4: 4 units * 47 = 188\n            * Item 5: 3 units * 43 = 129\n            * Total Value = 54 + 162 + 96 + 188 + 129 = 629\n\nLet's try an offer that gives the other player [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n        * My Items:\n            * Item 1: 3 units * 18 = 54\n            * Item 2: 6 units * 27 = 162\n            * Item 3: 6 units * 16 = 96\n            * Item 4: 5 units * 47 = 235\n            * Item 5: 3 units * 43 = 129\n            * Total Value = 54 + 162 + 96 + 235 + 129 = 676. This is my best possible offer.\n\nI will make an offer that gives the other player as little as possible, and still has a chance of being accepted. Giving the other player 1 unit of item 4 will result in a total value for me of 629. This offer is not greater than my outside offer, so I will not accept that.\nHowever, if i offer the other player zero items I get 676 which is greater than my outside option.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will make an initial offer to the other player. I will try and maximize my own outcome.\n    I will propose [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on an action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1087. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 76\n    *   Item 2: 25\n    *   Item 3: 84\n    *   Item 4: 65\n    *   Item 5: 35\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 6\n    *   Item 3: 6\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that any value obtained in later rounds is worth less to me than the same value now (earlier rounds). The discount factor for round 1 is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means they are keeping all items. My total value for this is 0.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since Player 1 is offering me nothing, I should counteroffer with a division of items that is favorable to me but that could be accepted by them. If I offer player 1 x units of an item i, then I keep the remainder for myself.\n    *   If I keep all of the items, my total value is:\n        *   (3 * 76) + (6 * 25) + (6 * 84) + (5 * 65) + (3 * 35) = 228 + 150 + 504 + 325 + 105 = 1312\n\n    Since my outside offer is 1087, and my total value of all the items is 1312, I should make a counteroffer. Since we are in round 1, the discount factor doesn't affect my decision. It is always in my interest to keep as many items as possible, since this will always result in a total value greater than my outside offer. I don't know Player 1's value for these items, so I will make an offer of giving them one of each of the items, since I don't know their values, and hope this gives them enough to be willing to accept it.\n\n*   **Comparison to my outside offer:**\n    * Accepting the current offer is worth 0, which is significantly lower than my outside offer of 1087.\n    * Making a counteroffer where I keep most of the items can be greater than 1087.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is a terrible choice.\n*   Walking away gives me 1087.\n*   I should make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. Giving Player 1 one of each item gives me a total value of:\n    *   Item 1: (3-1) * 76 = 152\n    *   Item 2: (6-1) * 25 = 125\n    *   Item 3: (6-1) * 84 = 420\n    *   Item 4: (5-1) * 65 = 260\n    *   Item 5: (3-1) * 35 = 70\n    *   Total: 152 + 125 + 420 + 260 + 70 = 1027. This is lower than my outside offer.\n    If instead I offer them: 0, 1, 1, 1, 0:\n      * Item 1: 3 * 76 = 228\n      * Item 2: 5 * 25 = 125\n      * Item 3: 5 * 84 = 420\n      * Item 4: 4 * 65 = 260\n      * Item 5: 3 * 35 = 105\n      * Total = 1138.\n    If I offer them [1,2,2,2,1]:\n      * Item 1: 2 * 76 = 152\n      * Item 2: 4 * 25 = 100\n      * Item 3: 4 * 84 = 336\n      * Item 4: 3 * 65 = 195\n      * Item 5: 2 * 35 = 70\n      * Total = 853\n\nI will offer Player 1 \\[0,1,1,1,0]\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

I will offer the other player the minimum reasonable amount\n    * 0 unit of item 1\n    * 1 unit of item 2\n    * 1 unit of item 3\n    * 0 unit of item 4\n    * 0 unit of item 5\n\n    This means I will receive\n    * 3 units of item 1\n    * 5 units of item 2\n    * 5 units of item 3\n    * 5 units of item 4\n    * 3 units of item 5\n\n    Value to me:\n    * 3 * 18 = 54\n    * 5 * 27 = 135\n    * 5 * 16 = 80\n    * 5 * 47 = 235\n    * 3 * 43 = 129\n    Total value to me: 633\n    Discounted value to me: 633 * 0.9 = 569.7\n\n    This is still not good enough. I need to get over 731 value in order to be better than my outside offer.\n\n    Since the current offer is less than my outside offer (81 < 658), and because of the discount factor on the final round and how little I would be able to get, I think the best course of action is to try to get a good deal now rather than take my outside option. I will offer the minimal amount to the other player that seems reasonable.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible for me, far below my outside offer even with the discount.

Note we are at round 2, so if we walk away after making a counteroffer it is as good as walking away now.\n    Let's consider several possible counteroffers and evaluate their discounted values:\n    * **Counteroffer 1: [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]** \n        *   My items: [2, 4, 4, 3, 2]\n        *   My value: (2 * 76) + (4 * 25) + (4 * 84) + (3 * 65) + (2 * 35) = 152 + 100 + 336 + 195 + 70 = 853\n        *   Discounted value: 853 * 0.9 = 767.7\n    * **Counteroffer 2: [0, 3, 3, 2, 1]**\n         *   My items: [3, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n         *   My value: (3 * 76) + (3 * 25) + (3 * 84) + (3 * 65) + (2 * 35) = 228 + 75 + 252 + 195 + 70= 820\n        *    Discounted value: 820 * 0.9 = 738\n   * **Counteroffer 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]**\n        *  My items: [3, 6, 6, 5, 3]\n        *  My value: (3 * 76) + (6 * 25) + (6 * 84) + (5 * 65) + (3 * 35) = 228 + 150 + 504 + 325 + 105 = 1312\n        *  Discounted value: 1312 * 0.9 = 1180.8\n    \n    The only way I am going to achieve above my outside offer is by making sure player 1 gets close to zero in value.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n* The current offer of 98.1 is far below my outside option of 1087.\n* I should not accept the current offer because it is extremely bad for me.\n*  My best bet is to make a counter offer as I am on the second round, and if the next round fails, I simply walk, but the potential to get more is very high. I will offer player 1 zero items.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This is my guaranteed fallback value if we don't reach an agreement.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values for each item are:\n    *   Item 1: 45\n    *   Item 2: 98\n    *   Item 3: 67\n    *   Item 4: 4\n    *   Item 5: 13\n*   **Total Pool of Items:** There are 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 available.\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that an agreement later in the negotiation is worth less than an agreement sooner. We are in round 1 now, so there is no discount yet. The discount will apply to the value of the outcome after this round.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], which means Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 5. My value for this offer is 1 * 13 = 13.\n*  **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer of 13 is much less than my outside offer value of 44.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer would give me a value of 13, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 44. Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n*   I should not walk away immediately. There are 2 more rounds to play, and I should try to negotiate a better deal.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 44 and I should try and extract value from the other agent.\n\nLet's calculate the value of keeping all of the items for myself:\n    5 units of item 1 = 5 * 45 = 225\n    2 units of item 2 = 2 * 98 = 196\n    4 units of item 3 = 4 * 67 = 268\n    0 units of item 4 = 0 * 4 = 0\n    2 units of item 5 = 2 * 13 = 26\nTotal: 715\n\nI want to propose a counteroffer that gives me significantly more value than my outside option, and so I should try and maximize the value I keep for myself, whilst leaving player 1 with little value.\n\nI should propose to give Player 1 only 1 unit of item 4. It has very little value for me (4), and I can keep all of my higher-value items.\n\nThis would leave me with:\n5 units of item 1 = 5 * 45 = 225\n2 units of item 2 = 2 * 98 = 196\n4 units of item 3 = 4 * 67 = 268\n0 units of item 4 = 0 * 4 = 0\n2 units of item 5 = 2 * 13 = 26\nTotal: 715\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that outcomes in later rounds are worth less to me, specifically, the value is reduced by a factor of gamma^(r-1), where r is the round number. Since this is round 1, if a deal is made in this round, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1, i.e., no discount. \n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since it's the first round, I need to propose a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value while also considering the other player. To determine the best offer, I can test various splits of the items and calculate my resulting value.\n    *   **Example 1: Even Split**: To start simple, let's consider a near even split, giving the other player half the items of each type that we have in total (rounded down). In this case, I would offer the following to the other player:\n         * 2 of item 1\n         * 3 of item 2\n         * 1 of item 3\n         * 1 of item 4\n         * 2 of item 5\n       This means I keep:\n         * 3 of item 1  -> 3 * 65 = 195\n         * 3 of item 2 -> 3 * 72 = 216\n         * 2 of item 3 -> 2 * 33 = 66\n         * 1 of item 4 -> 1 * 22 = 22\n         * 3 of item 5 -> 3 * 53 = 159\n       The total value for me with this offer would be 195 + 216 + 66 + 22 + 159 = 658.\n    *   **Example 2: Offer more to me** Lets see if offering the other player less would lead to a better outcome:\n        * 1 of item 1\n        * 2 of item 2\n        * 0 of item 3\n        * 0 of item 4\n        * 1 of item 5\n       This means I keep:\n         * 4 of item 1 -> 4 * 65 = 260\n         * 4 of item 2 -> 4 * 72 = 288\n         * 3 of item 3 -> 3 * 33 = 99\n         * 2 of item 4 -> 2 * 22 = 44\n         * 4 of item 5 -> 4 * 53 = 212\n       The total value for me with this offer would be 260 + 288 + 99 + 44 + 212 = 903\n    \n       A good heuristic would be to try to keep most of items 2, 5, and 1 given their high value for me. Let's give a little more to them on the others to not make the counteroffer seem too unfair.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** Both of these example offers are greater than my outside offer of 174. However, offering less to the other player produces more value for me. I will go with this approach and try to get the other player to accept a deal with the second example offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI should make a counteroffer with the second example offer as it leads to the highest value for me, and it is a better option than taking my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1006.

This means that a deal made in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the same deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value of round 1. This incentivizes reaching a deal sooner, if possible.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 0, 0, 1] units of items 1-5, respectively. That means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    \n    My value for this is:\n    (4 * 19) + (4 * 86) + (3 * 31) + (2 * 42) + (4 * 46) = 76 + 344 + 93 + 84 + 184 = 783.\n    \n*   **Comparison with outside offer:** My value from accepting this offer (783) is less than my outside offer value (1006). Therefore, I should not accept the offer as it stands.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** A reasonable counteroffer would aim to secure more of the high-value items (specifically item 2), while perhaps giving a bit more of other items to Player 1. Let's try calculating a potential counteroffer, where I keep 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 of item 5:\n    *   Item 1: 3 * 19 = 57\n    *   Item 2: 4 * 86 = 344\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 31 = 62\n    *   Item 4: 1 * 42 = 42\n    *   Item 5: 3 * 46 = 138\n    Total: 643. This is still less than my outside offer, so I want to aim for keeping a higher amount of the items. Let's try keeping 4 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 4 of item 5\n    *   Item 1: 4 * 19 = 76\n    *   Item 2: 5 * 86 = 430\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 31 = 62\n    *   Item 4: 1 * 42 = 42\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 46 = 184\n    Total: 794. Still lower. Let's try keeping 4 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 4 of item 5. \n    *   Item 1: 4 * 19 = 76\n    *   Item 2: 6 * 86 = 516\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 31 = 62\n    *   Item 4: 1 * 42 = 42\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 46 = 184\n    Total: 880. Still less than my outside option. Let's try a counteroffer that gives away less of item 2.\n     *   Item 1: 1 * 19 = 19\n    *   Item 2: 1 * 86 = 86\n    *   Item 3: 1 * 31 = 31\n    *   Item 4: 1 * 42 = 42\n    *   Item 5: 1 * 46 = 46\n    Total: 224, so this counteroffer would mean that I keep 4 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 4 of item 5. This is a value of 794, which we calculated previously. Let's consider another counteroffer.\n\n    Let's try giving Player 1: 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 1 of item 5. This means I get 4 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n    *   Item 1: 4 * 19 = 76\n    *   Item 2: 5 * 86 = 430\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 31 = 62\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 42 = 84\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 46 = 184\n    Total: 836.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is not good.\n*   My outside offer is currently better than the current offer, but I want to try and get more.\n*   The counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] would result in a value of 836. This counteroffer is still below my outside offer.\n    However, it's still round 1. With the discount factor in mind, let's make a counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 0, 1].\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 174. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 735 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 174.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 65 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 72 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 33 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 22 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 53 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that the value of a deal in round 2 is 0.9 times the undiscounted value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 65 = 65\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 72 = 72\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 33 = 33\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 22 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 53 = 53\n    *   Total value of current offer = 65 + 72 + 33 + 0 + 53 = 223\n    *   Discounted value of current offer = 223 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 223 * 0.9 = 200.7\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I might offer in order to get something better than my outside option of 174 and hopefully something better than the 200.7 I'd get from accepting the current offer.  A counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] means I get the full amount for myself. This would be:\n    *   5 units of item 1: 5 * 65 = 325\n    *   6 units of item 2: 6 * 72 = 432\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 33 = 99\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 22 = 44\n    *   5 units of item 5: 5 * 53 = 265\n    *  Total value = 325 + 432 + 99 + 44 + 265 = 1165\n    *  Discounted value = 1165 * (0.9)^1 = 1048.5\n    I will try an offer to player 2 of [0,1,0,0,0]. In that case, I receive 5, 5, 3, 2 and 5 of each respective item.\n    *   5 units of item 1: 5 * 65 = 325\n    *   5 units of item 2: 5 * 72 = 360\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 33 = 99\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 22 = 44\n    *   5 units of item 5: 5 * 53 = 265\n    *   Total value = 325 + 360 + 99 + 44 + 265 = 1093. Discounted value is 1093 * 0.9 = 983.7\n    I think I'll offer to give the other player 1 unit of item 2, and keep all other items. This has value far exceeding what the other player is currently offering and has a high enough present value to be worth making the offer.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (200.7) is higher than my outside option (174), which means that walking away here is not the best option.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is better than walking away. However, a counteroffer of giving player 2 1 unit of item 2, and keeping all other items has a much higher present value than the discounted value of the current offer. Therefore, I should make that counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1.

I want to maximize my value while also trying to get a deal. Since my total value of all items is 900 and my outside offer is 706, I need to make sure I receive a value of at least 706.  Let's start by calculating a counteroffer where I keep most of the high value items and offer the other player more of the low value items.\n\n    Here is an example of a potential counteroffer, with what I keep, and the value that gives me:\n    Offer to P2: [3, 2, 3, 3, 0]\n    I keep: [3, 2, 3, 3, 1]\n    My value:\n     3 * 32 + 2 * 100 + 3 * 18 + 3 * 33 + 1 * 2 = 96 + 200 + 54 + 99 + 2 = 451\n     451 < 706, so this is not a viable counteroffer, because I could take my outside offer for greater value.\n\n    Let's try a different counteroffer:\n    Offer to P2: [2, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n    I keep: [4, 3, 4, 4, 1]\n    My value:\n     4 * 32 + 3 * 100 + 4 * 18 + 4 * 33 + 1 * 2 = 128 + 300 + 72 + 132 + 2 = 634\n     634 < 706, so this is also not a viable counteroffer\n\n    Lets try another:\n    Offer to P2: [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n    I keep: [5, 4, 5, 5, 1]\n    My Value: \n    5*32 + 4*100 + 5*18 + 5*33 + 1*2 = 160 + 400 + 90 + 165 + 2 = 817\n    817 > 706, this is a viable counteroffer, although it is risky.\n\n    Let's try one more counteroffer with more for me:\n    Offer to P2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    I keep: [6, 4, 6, 6, 1]\n    My Value:\n    6*32 + 4*100 + 6*18 + 6*33 + 1*2 = 192 + 400 + 108 + 198 + 2 = 900\n    900 > 706, and it is greater than our other potential counteroffer as well, and therefore is a better counteroffer. This is a more risky, but high reward offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n    I should not accept the current offer since there is none. I should not walk away because I can try to get a deal that is worth more to me than my outside option. The best counteroffer I have found is for me to keep everything. So I will propose giving the other player nothing, and see if it gets accepted.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 38\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 13 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 56 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 98 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 24 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 45 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:** \n    *   6 units of item 1\n    *   4 units of item 2\n    *   6 units of item 3\n    *   6 units of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that the value of an agreement in round 2 is 0.9 times the nominal value, and the value of an agreement in round 3 is 0.9^2 = 0.81 times the nominal value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get to keep all of the items:\n    *   6 units of item 1 = 6 * 13 = 78\n    *   4 units of item 2 = 4 * 56 = 224\n    *   6 units of item 3 = 6 * 98 = 588\n    *   6 units of item 4 = 6 * 24 = 144\n    *   1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 45 = 45\n    *   Total value of current offer = 78 + 224 + 588 + 144 + 45 = 1079\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to think strategically here.  Player 1's offer of giving me nothing means they are keeping everything and getting a value of:\n   *  Player 1's value of the items, which I do not know\n   Since this is round 1, the discount factor does not impact the total value.\n\n    * A counteroffer of [3, 2, 3, 3, 0] (giving half of the items to Player 1 when possible):\n       *   3 units of item 1 = 3 * 13 = 39\n       *   2 units of item 2 = 2 * 56 = 112\n       *   3 units of item 3 = 3 * 98 = 294\n       *   3 units of item 4 = 3 * 24 = 72\n       *   1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 45 = 45\n       *  Total value of counter offer: 562\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer is worth 1079 to me, while my outside offer is worth 38. Since 1079 > 38, accepting the current offer is better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is the most favorable outcome for me since it allows me to keep all of the items, thus I should take the deal.\n\n**Final Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the same deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 (0.9 * 0.9) times the value of the same deal in round 1. This incentivizes reaching a deal earlier.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so I don't need to assess this value.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since it is round 1 and I have to make the first offer, I need to think about what would be a good offer.\n\nLet's consider an offer that gives player 2 roughly half of the total value. I will need to compute the total value of all the items, and divide by 2 to estimate what to offer.\n\n*Total value of all items*:\n    * Item 1: 5 * 64 = 320\n    * Item 2: 3 * 53 = 159\n    * Item 3: 6 * 22 = 132\n    * Item 4: 0 * 80 = 0\n    * Item 5: 3 * 84 = 252\n    * Total: 320 + 159 + 132 + 0 + 252 = 863\n    \nHalf of the total is approximately 431. \n\nTo give Player 2 a value of roughly 431, I need to give them relatively more of my highly valued items.  Let's try an initial offer of 2 item 1s, 1 item 2, 3 item 3s, 0 item 4s, and 1 item 5. The total value of this offer to me is:\n\n*   (5-2) item 1 = 3 * 64 = 192\n*   (3-1) item 2 = 2 * 53 = 106\n*   (6-3) item 3 = 3 * 22 = 66\n*    (0-0) item 4 = 0 * 80 = 0\n*   (3-1) item 5 = 2 * 84 = 168\n* Total: 192 + 106 + 66 + 0 + 168 = 532\n\nThis value of 532 is greater than my outside offer of 365, so this is a reasonable first offer to make.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nGiven the calculations above, I should propose a counteroffer to player 2.

If I am rational, I should make a counteroffer if the discounted value is greater than the outside value of 365. Lets consider offering them 1 unit each of 1, 2, 3 and 5. This leaves me with 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n    *   Value to me is: 4*64 + 2*53 + 5*22 + 0*80 + 2*84 = 256 + 106 + 110 + 0 + 168 = 640\n    *   Discounted value to me: 640 * 0.9 = 576\n    *  Consider also offering 0,0,0,0,0 to the other player. This has value 863. The discounted value is 863*0.9 = 776.7\n    * Consider a very high offer for the other player, giving them 4, 2, 5, 0, 2. This gives me 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 1 of item 5, which is 64+53+22+84 = 223. discounted value is 200.7\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The discounted value of the current offer is 200.7 which is less than my outside offer of 365.\n*   A counteroffer of [1,1,1,0,1] leads to a discounted value for me of 576 > 365.\n*   A counteroffer of [0,0,0,0,0] leads to a discounted value of 776.7 which is greater than 365.\n*   Because this is round 2, any offer I make will be considered in the next and final round.

I want to maximize my value, keeping in mind that I would prefer a value greater than my discounted outside offer if possible. My outside offer value is 753, and if I walk away this round, its discounted value would be 753 * (0.9^1) = 677.7.\n\n    Let's see what I could get by keeping all the items for myself and offering nothing. If player 1 accepts this, we have an arrangement I would get:\n    (5 * 22) + (3 * 99) + (6 * 68) + (0 * 32) + (3 * 99) = 110 + 297 + 408 + 0 + 297 = 1112\n    Then discounted, it becomes: 1112 * 0.9 = 1000.8\n\n    Given that the value of my items is 1112 and my outside offer value is 753 (discounted = 677.7), it's definitely advantageous for me to try to get as much of the items as possible.\n    The current offer gives me a value of 0, discounted it is still 0.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nAccepting the current offer is not good. If I were to walk away now, I would get a value of 677.7.  I will make a counteroffer. It's Round 2, so I want to try to get as much as possible since the discount factor penalizes me if I wait till the next round.

This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Values of the items:**\n    *   Item 1: 14 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 47 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 62 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 52 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 61 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 7 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less than offers in earlier rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since it is round 1 and I have to make a counteroffer, I need to think about an offer. I want to maximize my outcome. It's in my interest to try and get a value higher than my outside offer of 866 and it's in my interest to ensure player 2 has an offer better than their outside offer as well (though I don't know what that is).\n\nLet's calculate the total value of all items for me to help determine what my baseline offer will be:\n\nTotal Value to Me = (2 * 14) + (4 * 47) + (6 * 62) + (2 * 52) + (7 * 61) = 28 + 188 + 372 + 104 + 427 = 1119\n\nI will try making an offer that will give player 2 slightly less than half the items. Player 2 may still accept due to the uncertainty regarding their outside offer, and this should provide me with a relatively high value. I will offer player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 2 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. This leaves me with 1, 2, 3, 1, and 4 units of items respectively.\n\nMy Value with this offer: (1 * 14) + (2 * 47) + (3 * 62) + (1 * 52) + (4 * 61) = 14 + 94 + 186 + 52 + 244 = 590\nPlayer 2's Value is yet unknown.\nThis is less than my outside offer, but there are 2 more rounds to go. Given that the discount rate is only 0.9, it's probably more advantageous to give away less in the first offer, even if I get slightly less than 866 now. The discount will only diminish the value by 10% in each round, so it's important to make a good initial offer.\n I will make the offer stated above.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will make a counteroffer to Player 2\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 1, 3]}\n```\n",

Accepting this offer would be suboptimal.\n* **Potential Counteroffers:**\n      Given my higher valuation of Item 3, I would like to keep most of this.\n      Lets consider a potential counteroffer, where I offer the other player: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n      This would mean I keep:\n          *   Item 1: 2 units\n          *   Item 2: 4 units\n          *   Item 3: 5 units\n          *   Item 4: 2 units\n          *   Item 5: 7 units\n      The value of this outcome would be: 2 * 32 + 4 * 29 + 5 * 87 + 2 * 59 + 7 * 72 = 64 + 116 + 435 + 118 + 504 = 1237, which is higher than my outside offer.

Value to me: (1*14) + (2*47) + (3*62) + (1*52) + (4*61) = 14 + 94 + 186 + 52 + 244 = 590.  The present value of this offer would be 590 * 0.9 = 531.\n    *  Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2 (take all items for myself): My value would be (2*14) + (4*47) + (6*62) + (2*52) + (7*61) = 28 + 188 + 372 + 104 + 427 = 1119. The present value of this offer would be 1119*0.9 = 1007.1\n    *   Offer [0,1,0,0,0] to player 2: my value would be (2*14)+(3*47)+(6*62)+(2*52)+(7*61)=28+141+372+104+427 = 1072. The present value of this offer would be 1072*0.9=964.8\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer's value (55.8) is much lower than my outside offer (866).\n    *   My proposed counter offer in round 1 is worth 531 at present value, which is less than my outside offer.\n    *   Taking all items for myself is worth 1007.1 at present value, which is more than my outside offer.\n    *   Offering 1 unit of item 2 to player 2 gives a value of 964.8 at present value, which is more than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is terrible, I should not accept. My outside offer is 866, and it is likely that player 2 is also trying to maximize their offer, thus a deal is more likely if we are not overly greedy. Offering all the items would give me a value of 1007.1, and giving 1 unit of item 2 to player 2, I would get a value of 964.8. This is slightly more fair and better for me that taking everything.\n\nTherefore, I will propose a counteroffer to the other player.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 981.\n*   **Item Values:** My values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 32\n    *   Item 2: 29\n    *   Item 3: 87\n    *   Item 4: 59\n    *   Item 5: 72\n*   **Total Items:** There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 7 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. Since it is round 2, the current discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 32 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 29 = 29\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 87 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 59 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 72 = 0\n    *   Total value of the offer: 29\n    *  Present value of the offer: 29 * 0.9 = 26.1\n    \n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to think about what to offer Player 1 if I don't accept. My current offer to Player 1 was [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] on the previous turn, which is not a bad position. My goal is to get at least 981 with the discount factor, and it is currently round 2 so I need (981/0.9 = 1090), worth of items at the end of negotiations. Since it is round 2, I have 1 round of negotiations left, after which we walk if no deal is made. Since the current offer is low, and there is only one round left, I will make a counter offer with a value that comes close to my desired total, and see if Player 1 takes it.\n    If I offer [1, 3, 5, 1, 6], I would keep [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] and my value would be:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 32 = 32\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 29 = 29\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 87 = 87\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 59 = 59\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 72 = 72\n    *   Total Value of this offer is: 279\n    Discounted Value of this offer is: 279 * 0.9 = 251.1\n    If I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], I would keep all items:\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 32 = 64\n        *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 29 = 116\n        *   6 units of item 3: 6 * 87 = 522\n        *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 59 = 118\n        *   7 units of item 5: 7 * 72 = 504\n    Total value: 1324\n    Discounted value: 1324 * 0.9 = 1191.6\n    I need at least 1090 to be better off than my outside offer.\n    So I will offer Player 1 a small amount of items to see if they take it.\n    If I offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], I keep:\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 32 = 64\n        *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 29 = 116\n        *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 87 = 435\n        *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 59 = 118\n        *   7 units of item 5: 7 * 72 = 504\n        Total Value: 1237\n        Discounted Value: 1237 * 0.9 = 1113.3\n    This would be a good counter offer since it is better than the outside offer and it does not overly favor the other player.\n  \n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n    The current offer's value of 26.1 is far below my outside offer of 981.\n    The counteroffer value of 1113.3 is greater than the value I would get from walking.\n    \n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. I should not accept it. Walking will result in a value of 981, but making the counter offer has the potential to make more than this. Therefore I will counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 981\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 32\n    *   Item 2: 29\n    *   Item 3: 87\n    *   Item 4: 59\n    *   Item 5: 72\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 6\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 7\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 3, the discount factor is applied as 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81. This means any deal we make is worth 81% of its undiscounted value, because the deal is being made at round 3.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer value:** The current offer to me is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive nothing, thus this offer has a value of 0 for me.\n*   **Value of different divisions:** It's the final round. If I make a counteroffer here, it will automatically be treated as a WALK. So, the only offers I can consider are what I'm getting if I accept, or what I get if I walk.\n*   **Comparison to my outside offer:** If I accept the current offer, the discounted value to me will be 0 * 0.81 = 0. If I walk away, I get my outside offer of 981.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer has a value of 0, I am much better off walking away. Making a counteroffer will just default to a walk, so there's no point making a counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 645\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 45\n    *   Item 2: 78\n    *   Item 3: 9\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 40\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 11 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less. Specifically, an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value, and an offer in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value. This encourages me to try and get a good deal early.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    I need to figure out how to structure my initial offer. I want to maximize my value, but also make it appealing enough for Player 2 to accept (or at least not walk). I need to give away enough to make it worthwhile, but hold back enough so my value is greater than my outside offer of 645. Since it's the first round, I should start by proposing an offer where I get a good amount, but the other player gets a decent amount. I should avoid making a really low offer and risking a walk or a counter offer I would not like.\n\nLet's consider a few different counteroffers and calculate their value:\n\n    *   **Offer 1 (Give player 2 a low amount):** Giving player 2 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This leaves me with 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 4 units of item 5. My value is then: (3*45) + (4*78) + (9*9) + (3*5) + (4*40) = 135+312+81+15+160 = 703, which is higher than my outside offer. Player 2 might walk since it's not giving them much.\n    *   **Offer 2 (Give player 2 a moderate amount):** Giving player 2 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. This leaves me with 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5. My value is then: (2*45) + (3*78) + (6*9) + (2*5) + (3*40) = 90+234+54+10+120 = 508. This is too low.\n    *   **Offer 3 (Give player 2 a more substantial amount):** Giving player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 2 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 units of item 5. This leaves me with 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 4 units of item 5. My value is then: (3*45) + (3*78) + (6*9) + (2*5) + (4*40) = 135+234+54+10+160 = 593. This is still too low.\n    *  **Offer 4 (try to balance item values for me):** Giving player 2, 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 1 units of item 5. This leaves me with 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 4 units of item 5. My value is then: (3*45) + (4*78) + (8*9) + (3*5) + (4*40) = 135+312+72+15+160 = 694. This is higher than my outside offer.\n\n* **Comparing Values:**\n    Offer 1 (703) is the only one higher than my outside offer so far.\n    Offer 4 (694) is also higher than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nOffer 1 is better than offer 4. I will try to offer the minimum necessary to the other player to get a good deal, but not to low. If the other player is rational, they will accept something that is better than their outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I'll propose Offer 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 170. This is my guaranteed fallback option.\n*   **Item values:** My private values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 26\n    *   Item 2: 8\n    *   Item 3: 69\n    *   Item 4: 24\n    *   Item 5: 33\n*   **Total pool of items:** There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means that if a deal is reached in round 2, the value will be multiplied by 0.9, and in round 3, it would be multiplied by 0.9^2 = 0.81. Therefore, getting a deal sooner is worth more than getting the same deal later, so the discount factor will disincentivize waiting.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to decide what to offer. I will aim to get as much value as possible, but also consider a division that might be acceptable to the other player so that the deal can happen sooner rather than later. If there are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5, then I should offer what I value less to Player 2. Here is a list of potential counter offers and what their values would be to me:\n\n    *   Offer Player 2: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] : \n        I keep: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]. Value for me = (1 * 26) + (2 * 8) + (3 * 69) + (1 * 24) + (2 * 33) = 26 + 16 + 207 + 24 + 66 = 339\n    *   Offer Player 2: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1] :\n        I keep: [2, 2, 3, 2, 2]. Value for me = (2 * 26) + (2 * 8) + (3 * 69) + (2 * 24) + (2 * 33) = 52 + 16 + 207 + 48 + 66 = 389\n    *    Offer Player 2: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] :\n        I keep: [2, 3, 3, 2, 3]. Value for me = (2 * 26) + (3 * 8) + (3 * 69) + (2 * 24) + (3 * 33) = 52 + 24 + 207 + 48 + 99 = 430\n    *    Offer Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] :\n        I keep: [2, 3, 4, 2, 3]. Value for me = (2 * 26) + (3 * 8) + (4 * 69) + (2 * 24) + (3 * 33) = 52 + 24 + 276 + 48 + 99 = 499\n    *    Offer Player 2: [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n        I keep: [1, 2, 4, 1, 3]. Value for me = (1 * 26) + (2 * 8) + (4 * 69) + (1 * 24) + (3 * 33) = 26 + 16 + 276 + 24 + 99 = 441\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** All of the counteroffers above have a value to me that is far greater than my outside offer value of 170. Given that it's round 1, and that I value item 3 very highly, a division that maximizes my value while giving some of the less valuable items to the other player is preferable.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nGiven that there is no current offer on the table, and my goal is to maximize my value, I should make a counteroffer. I think that offering [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] is a reasonable offer to the other player which maximizes my own value given my valuations and also has a good chance of being accepted by the other player at round 1. If it is not, then I have the possibility of offering a better deal to them in round 2.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 626. This is my guaranteed fallback option.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 73\n    *   Item 2: 35\n    *   Item 3: 48\n    *   Item 4: 21\n    *   Item 5: 89\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n*  **Discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. This means that outcomes in later rounds are worth less than the same outcome in earlier rounds. Specifically, the value of an outcome after round r is discounted by 0.9^(r-1). Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].  This means I would receive 1 unit of each item. My value would be:\n    *   1 * 73 + 1 * 35 + 1 * 48 + 1 * 21 + 1 * 89 = 266\n    \n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate what I would receive, and evaluate my value. The current offer isn't great for me.\n    * If I gave player 1 all of the items except 1 unit of each. 1 unit of each would give me a value of 266 (calculated above).\n    * If I gave player 1 all of the items except the following: 2 units of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5. This would be the same as keeping them all which would be 2 * 73 + 3 * 35 + 4 * 48 + 2 * 21 + 3 * 89 = 146 + 105 + 192 + 42 + 267 = 752.\n    * If I gave player 1 0 units of each item. This is the same as keeping everything which is a total value of 752. This would be equivalent to offering player 1 [0,0,0,0,0]\n    * If I gave player 1 1 unit of each item. This would be equivalent to keeping 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5, which would be a value of 1 * 73 + 2 * 35 + 3 * 48 + 1 * 21 + 2 * 89 = 73 + 70 + 144 + 21 + 178 = 486.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer of 266 is significantly lower than my outside offer of 626. My counteroffer, where I keep everything, and give player 1 nothing has a value of 752 to me which is also greater than my outside offer. Any outcome that is not better than the outside offer should be refused, as I can always choose to walk away and take my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [1,1,1,1,1], valued at 266, is significantly worse than my outside offer of 626.\n*   I can make a counteroffer that would be better than my outside offer (keeping everything)\n*   Since it is still round one and there is no discount to the value to me, I am best to make a counteroffer, and therefore not accept the current offer.\n*   I should offer Player 1 [0,0,0,0,0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Since this is round 2, the current discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.  If we get to round 3, then it will be 0.9^2 = 0.81. This means that a deal now is worth 0.9 compared to the raw values, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would get all the items. My total value would be (2 \\* 26) + (3 \\* 8) + (4 \\* 69) + (2 \\* 24) + (3 \\* 33) = 52 + 24 + 276 + 48 + 99 = 499. With the current discount factor of 0.9, the present value is 499 * 0.9 = 449.1\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few potential counteroffers, understanding that I want to receive at least 170/0.9 = 188.88 units of value:\n    *   *Offer 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]*: This means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5. My value is (1 * 26) + (2 * 8) + (3 * 69) + (1 * 24) + (2 * 33) = 26 + 16 + 207 + 24 + 66 = 339. This is worth 339 * 0.9 = 305.1 and is better than my outside offer.\n    *   *Offer 2: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]*: This means I keep 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 2 of item 5. My value is (2 * 26) + (2 * 8) + (3 * 69) + (2 * 24) + (2 * 33) = 52 + 16 + 207 + 48 + 66 = 389. 389 * 0.9 = 350.1 which is also better than my outside offer.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** If I accept the current offer, I get 449.1. My outside offer is worth 170. Any outcome with present value greater than 170 is better than walking away.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer gives me 449.1. This is much better than my outside offer of 170.\n*   Given the potential counteroffers I evaluated, it appears I would do better to either accept this or offer the first counter offer I evaluated.

Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1. This means that there's no penalty for delaying to the next round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what counteroffer would be best for me. I want to maximize my value, but I also have to consider what is likely to be accepted by Player 2.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there's no current offer, I cannot accept. I can choose to walk away (and take my outside offer of 600), or I can make a counteroffer. Since the discount factor is 1 for this round, I am better off trying to get a deal that is worth more to me than my outside offer, since I'm not being penalized for waiting until the second round if this is rejected. My total potential value from all the items is:\n(3 * 19) + (4 * 26) + (3 * 80) + (4 * 57) + (4 * 64) = 57 + 104 + 240 + 228 + 256 = 885.\n\nA fair split where we each get half of the value would be 442.5, but I would like to keep more of the items I value highly. For example, if I propose an offer where player 2 gets 1 unit of items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, this would be worth 19 + 26 + 80 + 57 + 64 = 246 to them, and 885 - 246 = 639 to me. If I propose a slightly more aggressive offer, such as where I keep 2 units of item 3, and all 4 units of item 5, and player 2 gets the rest, that gives me a value of (3 * 19) + (4 * 26) + (2 * 80) + (4 * 57) + (4 * 64) = 57 + 104 + 160 + 228 + 256 = 805.

The value of a deal made in round *r* is multiplied by gamma^(r-1). In this round (round 1), the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1, so no discount for this round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], meaning they are giving me 1 unit of each item and keeping the rest.\n    *   My value for this offer:\n        *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 93 = 93\n        *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 34 = 34\n        *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 26 = 26\n        *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 8 = 8\n        *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 96 = 96\n        *   Total value: 93 + 34 + 26 + 8 + 96 = 257\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would want to keep for myself. Here's one calculation.\n    *   If I offered Player 1 [0,0,0,0,0], that means I keep [3,4,3,4,4]. My value for keeping these items would be:\n       *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 93 = 279\n       *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 34 = 136\n       *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 26 = 78\n       *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 8 = 32\n       *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 96 = 384\n       * Total value: 279+136+78+32+384 = 909\n\n*  **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 257 to me, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 59.  If I offer Player 1 [0,0,0,0,0] then I keep everything for myself and that has a value of 909.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of 257 is a pretty good deal, but it could be better. I have not had to use the discount factor yet, so there is no downside to delaying a round for now.\n\nI would like to make a counteroffer in an attempt to get an even better deal for myself by keeping the most of the items. I propose a counteroffer that would have me keeping the rest, offering them 0 of each item.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 102.\n*   **Item Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 15 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 6 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 59 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 33 per unit\n*   **Total Item Pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its undiscounted value, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its undiscounted value. This incentivizes reaching an agreement earlier rather than later, although its effect may be small.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table. Thus my value is undefined.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider potential divisions of the items and how they would compare to my outside offer. I want to maximize my value while making it appealing enough to be accepted. I must remember that I have to calculate what the offer will be that I am giving to my opponent, as the framework is based around this idea. Given the absence of any offer from Player 2, I need to make an opening offer that will start the game. I will start by offering half of each item, rounding down if necessary.\n    * Offer to player 2 of 1 unit of item 1. My value of item 1 is therefore 2*4 = 8.\n    * Offer to player 2 of 0 unit of item 2. My value of item 2 is therefore 1*15 = 15.\n    * Offer to player 2 of 2 unit of item 3. My value of item 3 is therefore 3*6= 18.\n    * Offer to player 2 of 2 unit of item 4. My value of item 4 is therefore 2*59= 118.\n    * Offer to player 2 of 3 unit of item 5. My value of item 5 is therefore 3*33= 99.\n    The total value to me is 8 + 15 + 18 + 118 + 99 = 258. This is well above my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\nGiven there is no offer on the table I cannot accept, and I should not walk away, as I have not even attempted to negotiate. I will therefore propose a counteroffer that gives an equal split of items to my opponent, whilst still providing a high value to me.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 2, 3]}\n```\n",

Let's calculate what my max value is if I keep everything:\n    (3 * 74) + (1 * 6) + (5 * 7) + (4 * 64) + (6 * 61) = 222 + 6 + 35 + 256 + 366 = 885.\n    It is likely I won't be able to get all of that, but let's start with a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n\n    Since I can get 541 from my outside offer, I will propose a counteroffer that gives me more than that if it is accepted. For instance, what if I offer Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n    Then I keep all the items, and my value is 885.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 486 to me, which is less than my outside option of 541. Therefore, I will not accept the offer.\n*   I should not walk away immediately, since it's round 1, and we can continue negotiations.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that is much better for me (and likely much worse for Player 1) to see how player 1 reacts.\n\nTherefore, I'll propose a counteroffer where I keep everything.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

For example a counteroffer where I try to keep everything good:\n   *   Offer: [1, 1, 3, 3, 5] which would mean I keep 2 units of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 1 of item 5. Value is (2 * 4) + (0 * 15) + (2 * 6) + (1 * 59) + (1 * 33) = 8 + 0 + 12 + 59 + 33 = 112 . Discounted value is 112 * 0.9 = 100.8\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The discounted value of accepting the current offer (441.9) is much higher than my outside offer (102).\n    *  The discounted value of keeping everything good (100.8) is still slightly worse than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer provides a discounted value of 441.9, which is much better than my outside offer of 102.\n*   Making a counter offer is risky as we are at round 2, and the value I can get is not guaranteed to be better than the outside offer after discounting.\n* Therefore, the best option is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1081. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1056 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1081\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 17, Item 2: 93, Item 3: 80, Item 4: 99, Item 5: 63\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 8 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  This means that any deal made in a later round is worth less than a deal made now.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** As the first player, I am making the initial offer, so a counteroffer analysis is not immediately necessary. However, since my goal is to exceed my outside offer I will consider making an offer that will lead to a high value for myself. I have a total value of 1194. I will start by making a rather greedy offer, keeping most of the valued items for myself, and see if Player 2 accepts.\n    Let's consider an offer where I keep 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 7 units of item 5. This implies that I'll offer the other player 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5. \n     My value of this would be: (4*17) + (1*93) + (3*80) + (0*99) + (7*63) = 68 + 93 + 240 + 0 + 441 = 842.\n     This offer is not acceptable since it's less than my outside offer value of 1081.\n\nLet's consider an offer where I keep 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 6 units of item 5. This implies that I'll offer the other player 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 2 unit of item 5. \n     My value of this would be: (3*17) + (2*93) + (3*80) + (1*99) + (6*63) = 51 + 186 + 240 + 99 + 378 = 954.\n      This offer is also not acceptable since it's less than my outside offer value of 1081.\n\nLet's try another offer where I keep 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 7 units of item 5. This implies that I'll offer the other player 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5. \n     My value of this would be: (3*17) + (1*93) + (3*80) + (1*99) + (7*63) = 51 + 93 + 240 + 99 + 441 = 924.\n     This offer is not acceptable since it's less than my outside offer value of 1081.\n\nLet's try another offer where I keep 2 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 7 units of item 5. This implies that I'll offer the other player 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5. \n     My value of this would be: (2*17) + (1*93) + (3*80) + (1*99) + (7*63) = 34 + 93 + 240 + 99 + 441 = 907.\n      This offer is also not acceptable since it's less than my outside offer value of 1081.\n\nLet's try an offer where I keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 8 units of item 5.\nThis implies I offer 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5. My value of this would be: (1*17) + (1*93) + (2*80) + (1*99) + (8*63) = 17 + 93 + 160 + 99 + 504 = 873.\nThis offer is also not acceptable.\n\nLet's try an offer where I keep 1 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 8 units of item 5.\nThis implies I offer 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5. My value of this would be: (1*17) + (0*93) + (2*80) + (1*99) + (8*63) = 17 + 0 + 160 + 99 + 504 = 780.\nThis offer is also not acceptable.\n\nGiven my constraint that my offer must be greater than my outside offer, my best strategy to to make an offer that would hopefully be accepted. Since I have a lot of item 5, that is the least valuable for me, I can try to offer the other player more of that item, while keeping the other items for myself.\n\nLet's try keeping 4 unit of item 1, 2 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4 and 4 units of item 5. This means I am offering the other player 1 units of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 4 units of item 5. My value would be (4*17) + (2*93) + (4*80) + (1*99) + (4*63) = 68 + 186 + 320 + 99 + 252 = 925. This is not acceptable either. \n\nLet's try keeping 3 unit of item 1, 2 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4 and 4 units of item 5. This means I am offering the other player 2 units of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 4 units of item 5. My value would be (3*17) + (2*93) + (3*80) + (1*99) + (4*63) = 51 + 186 + 240 + 99 + 252 = 828. This is not acceptable either. \n\nSince any deal in round 1 is more valuable than the same deal in future rounds, and I can't create any acceptable offer for myself right now, I will offer the other player a lot of the least valuable item for me to encourage a quick deal. Let's offer the other player 3 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4 and 6 units of item 5. This leaves me with 2 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5. This is worth (2*17)+(1*93)+(3*80)+(1*99)+(2*63) = 34+93+240+99+126= 592\n\nSince I cannot come up with a better initial offer I will offer [3, 1, 1, 0, 6].\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   I will propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 0, 6]}\n```\n",

I could, for example, calculate the value to me of keeping all of each type of item for myself, which would be my total value, which was calculated to be 1093.\n\n    *Keeping all items:*\n        *   3 * 2 (item 1) = 6\n        *   5 * 79 (item 2) = 395\n        *   4 * 97 (item 3) = 388\n        *   2 * 82 (item 4) = 164\n        *   5 * 28 (item 5) = 140\n        *   Total: 1093\n\n    Since there is no offer on the table yet, I will start with a counter offer that gives myself the majority of items, and player 2 with a lower amount of items, but still better than walking away with 0, which is the alternative for both if no deal is agreed. I will aim to take around 2/3 of the total value. I will take the most valuable items for myself. As a starting point, I will give the other player 1 unit of items 1,2, and 3, which are not the lowest value items, but not the highest either, and keep the rest for myself.\n\n     *Offer of 1 unit of items 1, 2, and 3 to Player 2*\n        *   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 2 = 4\n        *   4 units of item 2 = 4 * 79 = 316\n        *   3 units of item 3 = 3 * 97 = 291\n        *   2 units of item 4 = 2 * 82 = 164\n        *   5 units of item 5 = 5 * 28 = 140\n        *   Total value = 915\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 915 > 742.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n* Since there's no current offer, I cannot accept. I will make a counteroffer that gives Player 2 a small amount of items and allows me to get a deal that I deem valuable. This allows me to leave room for negotiation and makes it unlikely that player 2 will reject without any counteroffer at all. The value of the deal if I get these items is 915 which is better than my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 147\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 27\n    *   Item 2: 14\n    *   Item 3: 55\n    *   Item 4: 27\n    *   Item 5: 27\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its value in round 1. The discount factor encourages reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 0], which means I would receive 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of item 1: 1 * 27 = 27\n    *   Value of item 2: 1 * 14 = 14\n    *   Value of item 3: 1 * 55 = 55\n    *   Value of item 4: 0 * 27 = 0\n    *   Value of item 5: 0 * 27 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 27 + 14 + 55 + 0 + 0 = 96.\n*   **Comparing to outside offer:** The current offer (96) is less than my outside offer (147). Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a bad choice.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to propose a counteroffer that gives me more value than my outside offer, while also being potentially acceptable to Player 1, which is not something I know how to evaluate at the moment. Let's evaluate the maximum I can get in the negotiation. I have 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5. This is worth 3 * 27 + 5 * 14 + 4 * 55 + 2 * 27 + 5 * 27 = 81 + 70 + 220 + 54 + 135 = 560. If I offer Player 1 nothing, I get a value of 560. That is the best case scenario, but this isn't likely to be accepted. Let's create a counteroffer that gets me slightly more than my outside offer, and see if this gets accepted.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give the other player 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This will give me a total of 3*27 + 4*14 + 4*55 + 2*27 + 5*27 = 81+56+220+54+135=546. That would be 546 > 147.\nI will now test the value of taking 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This would yield 3*27 + 3*14 + 4*55 + 2*27 + 5*27 = 81+42+220+54+135 = 532.\n\nLet me create a counter offer that gives me the following: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. My value for this would be 2*27 + 4*14 + 3*55 + 2*27 + 4*27 = 54 + 56 + 165 + 54 + 108=437. I will offer player 1: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This is an arbitrary counteroffer, and this might be the best way to go, as it ensures the deal is better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is not acceptable since it is less than my outside offer.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer. I will counteroffer with a value of 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 147\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 27\n    *   Item 2: 14\n    *   Item 3: 55\n    *   Item 4: 27\n    *   Item 5: 27\n*   **Total items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 5\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since it's round 2, the discount factor will be applied as gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.  My value for this offer is (0 * 27) + (1 * 14) + (0 * 55) + (0 * 27) + (0 * 27) = 14. Applying the discount factor for round 2, the value to me of accepting the current offer is 14 * 0.9 = 12.6.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider keeping at least my outside offer value worth of items. The total pool of items is worth (3*27) + (5*14) + (4*55) + (2*27) + (5*27) = 81 + 70 + 220 + 54 + 135 = 560. A counteroffer that keeps most of the valuable items would be best. Let's calculate a potential counteroffer where I keep most items and give some of the lowest valued item to the other player. I could keep 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 4 units of item 5 and offer the remainder to player 1. This is an offer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1. This would be worth (1 * 27) + (1 * 14) + (1 * 55) + (1 * 27) + (1 * 27) = 150, I would get 410 from my share. Applying discount factor, the value is 410 * 0.9 = 369.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Accepting the current offer has a value of 12.6, much less than my outside offer of 147.\n    *   The proposed counter offer I calculated would be worth 369 with the discount factor, much more than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is terrible, with a value of 12.6, less than my outside offer of 147.\n*   Walking away gives me a guaranteed 147, so is an option.\n*   A good counteroffer will give me greater value.\n\nI will make a counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1. This maximizes the value I would get if accepted.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Therefore, accepting the offer would be a bad choice.\n*   Making a counter offer would be rejected by the opponent, and thus a walk is required.\n*  Walking will ensure the full value of 742, given the game ends immediately.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

I also know Player 2's values are also drawn between 1 and 101 for each item, so it's reasonable to try to split the items somewhat evenly.\n\n    Here's the value calculation for a potential offer (keeping the other items for myself). Let's try offering player 2 half the items. \n    *   Offer Player 2:  5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n    *   My remaining items: 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n    *   My value calculation:\n        *   5 units of item 1: 5 * 63 = 315\n        *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 47 = 141\n        *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 31 = 62\n        *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 18 = 36\n        *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 58 = 232\n        *   Total value: 315 + 141 + 62 + 36 + 232 = 786\n    This is far lower than my outside offer.\n    Let's try offering player 2 a smaller amount of items. Let's consider offering Player 2:\n    * Offer Player 2: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n    * My remaining items: 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n    * My value calculation:\n        * 7 units of item 1: 7 * 63 = 441\n        * 5 units of item 2: 5 * 47 = 235\n        * 3 units of item 3: 3 * 31 = 93\n        * 3 units of item 4: 3 * 18 = 54\n        * 5 units of item 5: 5 * 58 = 290\n        * Total value: 441 + 235 + 93 + 54 + 290 = 1113\n\nThis is still less than my outside option.\nLet's consider offering 1 item of each to the other player:\n    * Offer Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n    * My remaining items: 9 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5.\n    * My value calculation:\n        * 9 units of item 1: 9 * 63 = 567\n        * 5 units of item 2: 5 * 47 = 235\n        * 2 units of item 3: 2 * 31 = 62\n        * 2 units of item 4: 2 * 18 = 36\n        * 7 units of item 5: 7 * 58 = 406\n        * Total value: 567 + 235 + 62 + 36 + 406= 1306\n\nLet's try offering only item 5 to the other player, as it is my highest value item.\n    * Offer Player 2: 0 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 3 unit of item 5.\n    * My remaining items: 10 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n     * My value calculation:\n        * 10 units of item 1: 10 * 63 = 630\n        * 6 units of item 2: 6 * 47 = 282\n        * 3 units of item 3: 3 * 31 = 93\n        * 3 units of item 4: 3 * 18 = 54\n        * 5 units of item 5: 5 * 58 = 290\n        * Total value: 630 + 282 + 93 + 54 + 290 = 1349\n\nLet's try offering only 1 unit of each item except item 5, and 2 of item 5 to player 2.\n   * Offer Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   * My remaining items: 9 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n    * My value calculation:\n        * 9 units of item 1: 9 * 63 = 567\n        * 5 units of item 2: 5 * 47 = 235\n        * 2 units of item 3: 2 * 31 = 62\n        * 2 units of item 4: 2 * 18 = 36\n        * 6 units of item 5: 6 * 58 = 348\n        * Total value: 567 + 235 + 62 + 36 + 348= 1248\n\nLet's try offering 1 item of each except for 0 item 5:\n    * Offer Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 unit of item 5.\n    * My remaining items: 9 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5.\n    * My value calculation:\n        * 9 units of item 1: 9 * 63 = 567\n        * 5 units of item 2: 5 * 47 = 235\n        * 2 units of item 3: 2 * 31 = 62\n        * 2 units of item 4: 2 * 18 = 36\n        * 8 units of item 5: 8 * 58 = 464\n        * Total value: 567 + 235 + 62 + 36 + 464= 1364\n\nIt seems offering 1 of each of the first four items yields a decent return. Let's try offering 1 item of each of the first 3 items, and zero of items 4 and 5.\n    * Offer Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 0 unit of item 5.\n    * My remaining items: 9 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5.\n    * My value calculation:\n        * 9 units of item 1: 9 * 63 = 567\n        * 5 units of item 2: 5 * 47 = 235\n        * 2 units of item 3: 2 * 31 = 62\n        * 3 units of item 4: 3 * 18 = 54\n        * 8 units of item 5: 8 * 58 = 464\n        * Total value: 567 + 235 + 62 + 54 + 464= 1382\n\nOkay, I will offer the above.\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will propose a counteroffer to Player 2. Offering one of the first three items and nothing more maximizes my value compared to what I have tried previously while still leaving reasonable room for Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Since I know that Player 2 offered me [2,1,0,0,2] and their round 1 offer was [1,1,1,0,0] to me, I think a good strategy is to demand more of Item 1 and Item 5 which have the highest value for me, and be willing to concede on Items 2, 3 and 4, which have lower value for me.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 1, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 823.\n*   **Item values:** My values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 38\n    *   Item 2: 78\n    *   Item 3: 87\n    *   Item 4: 86\n    *   Item 5: 37\n*   **Total pool of items:** 10 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 8 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means any deal made in this round will be worth 0.9 times its nominal value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 2, 1, 1, 4]. This means I would receive:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 38 = 76\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 78 = 156\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 87 = 87\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 86 = 86\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 37 = 148\n    *   Total value of the current offer: 76 + 156 + 87 + 86 + 148 = 553\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 553 * 0.9 = 497.7\n    \n    This value is less than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider if I can get more than 823. Since this is round 2, a counteroffer is my final chance to get a better deal. I have 10 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 8 of item 5 available. My total value if I took all of them would be 10*38 + 6*78 + 3*87 + 3*86 + 8*37= 380 + 468 + 261 + 258 + 296= 1663. Let's evaluate what the value of keeping all items except 1 of each is. 9*38 + 5*78 + 2*87 + 2*86 + 7*37= 342 + 390+ 174+ 172+ 259 = 1337. This means a counteroffer of [1,1,1,1,1] would get me a value of 1337 which after the discount would be 1337*0.9=1203.3. This is significantly more than my outside offer. So I should be able to get an offer that exceeds my outside offer. Let's consider offering [3,3,1,1,3] as a counteroffer. \n    If I offer [3, 3, 1, 1, 3] to Player 1, this would leave me with:\n    *   7 units of item 1: 7 * 38 = 266\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 78 = 234\n    *   2 unit of item 3: 2 * 87 = 174\n    *   2 unit of item 4: 2 * 86 = 172\n    *   5 units of item 5: 5 * 37 = 185\n    *   Total value of this offer: 266 + 234 + 174 + 172 + 185 = 1031\n     * Discounted value = 1031 *0.9= 927.9. This is much greater than my outside offer so I should make a counteroffer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer has a discounted value of 497.7 which is less than my outside offer of 823.\n*   I calculated that a counteroffer of [3,3,1,1,3] would provide me with a value of 927.9 which is more than the value of my outside offer.\n*   Therefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 1, 1, 3]}\n```\n",

The discounted value of the current offer, 447.93, is much lower than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer where I get 7 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 5 of item 5, and offer the rest to Player 2:\n    *   7 units of item 1: 7 * 63 = 441\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 47 = 141\n    *   2 unit of item 3: 2 * 31 = 62\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 18 = 36\n    *   5 units of item 5: 5 * 58 = 290\n    *   Total value before discount = 441 + 141 + 62 + 36 + 290 = 970\n    *   Total value after discount = 970 * 0.81 = 785.70\n    This is still below my outside offer value.\n    Let's try a counteroffer that maximizes my return, where I get the maximum number of my most valued items, which are item 1 and 5, and keep in mind that I cannot offer more units than available. Let me make an offer where I keep all 10 units of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 8 units of item 5.

Then I would keep: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5\n\n    * 3 units of item 1: 3 * 54 = 162\n    * 3 units of item 2: 3 * 79 = 237\n    * 3 units of item 3: 3 * 20 = 60\n    * 5 units of item 4: 5 * 92 = 460\n    * 2 units of item 5: 2 * 6 = 12\n    * Total value: 162 + 237 + 60 + 460 + 12 = 931\n\nThis offer is worth more than my outside offer.\n\nI will go with that as my initial offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I need to make an initial offer. I will offer the other player 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 4, 2]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 316.\n*   **Item values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 59\n    *   Item 2: 89\n    *   Item 3: 78\n    *   Item 4: 60\n    *   Item 5: 77\n*   **Total pool of items:** 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1, and accepting an offer in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times its value in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [1, 1, 3, 4, 2], which means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit, value = 1 * 59 = 59\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit, value = 1 * 89 = 89\n    *   Item 3: 3 unit, value = 3 * 78 = 234\n    *   Item 4: 4 unit, value = 4 * 60 = 240\n    *   Item 5: 2 unit, value = 2 * 77 = 154\n    *   Total value = 59 + 89 + 234 + 240 + 154 = 776\n\n    Since it is round 1, this value is not discounted, therefore, my total value is 776.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I will consider a counteroffer that aims to keep more of the higher-value items. I will aim for a split that gives me a minimum value, while considering the outside offer is 316.\n\n    Let's evaluate a hypothetical counteroffer where I keep 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 5 of item 4 and 3 of item 5, giving Player 1 the rest. This would be a counteroffer of [1, 1, 3, 4, 1].\n    \n    This would result in me getting:\n    *   Item 1: 3 units, value = 3 * 59 = 177\n    *   Item 2: 3 units, value = 3 * 89 = 267\n    *   Item 3: 3 units, value = 3 * 78 = 234\n    *   Item 4: 5 units, value = 5 * 60 = 300\n    *   Item 5: 3 units, value = 3 * 77 = 231\n    *   Total value = 177 + 267 + 234 + 300 + 231 = 1209.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (776) is significantly better than my outside offer (316). The hypothetical counteroffer (1209) is even better.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 776 to me, which is much greater than my outside offer of 316. However, it seems I could obtain a better split. Therefore, I should make a counteroffer. \n\nI will propose the counteroffer calculated above of [1, 1, 3, 4, 1]. This will result in me keeping [3, 3, 3, 5, 3], which totals 1209 for me.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 4, 1]}\n```\n",

Since we are in round 2, the discount factor to this round is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 3, 4, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 54 = 54\n    *   Item 2: 1 * 79 = 79\n    *   Item 3: 3 * 20 = 60\n    *   Item 4: 4 * 92 = 368\n    *   Item 5: 1 * 6 = 6\n    *   Total value: 54 + 79 + 60 + 368 + 6 = 567\n    *   Discounted total value: 567 * 0.9 = 510.3\n    \n    Since 510.3 is less than my outside offer of 896, it would not be acceptable to accept this offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what would be beneficial to propose. My previous offer was to give [1, 1, 3, 4, 2] to the other player, so I was keeping [3,3,3,5,2] resulting in\n       3 * 54 = 162\n       3 * 79 = 237\n       3 * 20 = 60\n       5 * 92 = 460\n       2 * 6 = 12\n       Total of 931\n   \n    Let's calculate the value of keeping everything for me:\n       4 * 54 = 216\n       4 * 79 = 316\n       6 * 20 = 120\n       9 * 92 = 828\n       4 * 6 = 24\n       Total value is 1504\n\n    I need to consider what is my best option considering that there is still one round left, but time is of the essence because of the discount rate. Let's try a more equitable offer than before to see if we can come to an agreement. Let's consider an offer that gives player 2 half of everything rounded up: [2, 2, 3, 5, 2]. This means I get to keep [2, 2, 3, 4, 2] which results in:\n       2 * 54 = 108\n       2 * 79 = 158\n       3 * 20 = 60\n       4 * 92 = 368\n       2 * 6 = 12\n    Total value is 706. Discounted to this round it is 706 * 0.9 = 635.4, which is still not better than my outside option of 896.\n\n   Let's see if offering an offer where they get the minimum that they had before would be sufficient for me to exceed my outside offer value. If we give them [1,1,3,4,1] then we are left with [3, 3, 3, 5, 3].\n       3 * 54 = 162\n       3 * 79 = 237\n       3 * 20 = 60\n       5 * 92 = 460\n       3 * 6 = 18\n    Total value is 937. Discounted value is 937 * 0.9 = 843.3 which is less than my outside value of 896.\n\n   It seems very difficult to get a deal here that would benefit me more than just taking my outside offer at this point in time.\n   \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   Given that there is one round left, I will try to see if I can push for a more favourable deal by offering a counteroffer. Since this is my last shot to avoid walking away, I'll propose a counteroffer where I get the majority of the good items (4,2) and concede more of item 3, with the goal of meeting somewhere more advantageous to myself.

Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 4, 4, 2]. This means they keep [3, 3, 2, 5, 2]. Let's calculate my value for the current offer.\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 59 = 59\n    *   Item 2: 1 * 89 = 89\n    *   Item 3: 4 * 78 = 312\n    *   Item 4: 4 * 60 = 240\n    *   Item 5: 2 * 77 = 154\n    *   Total value: 59 + 89 + 312 + 240 + 154 = 854\n    *   Discounted value: 854 * 0.9 = 768.6\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    Since the game is in the second of three rounds I could consider making a counteroffer which is better for me. A counteroffer that gives me at least as much as my outside offer would be something I'd consider.\n    Let's say I offered the following: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My value is:\n    *   Item 1: 4 * 59 = 236\n    *   Item 2: 4 * 89 = 356\n    *   Item 3: 6 * 78 = 468\n    *   Item 4: 9 * 60 = 540\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 77 = 308\n    *   Total value = 1908\n    *   Discounted value: 1908 * 0.9 = 1717.2\n    This is far better than my outside option so is very greedy. It may not be accepted by the other player.\n\n    Let's try another counteroffer. An equal split of the items with me having an additional unit of each item.\n    My counteroffer would be: [1, 1, 2, 3, 1] - meaning I receive [3, 3, 4, 6, 3]\n    *   Item 1: 3 * 59 = 177\n    *   Item 2: 3 * 89 = 267\n    *   Item 3: 4 * 78 = 312\n    *   Item 4: 6 * 60 = 360\n    *   Item 5: 3 * 77 = 231\n    *   Total value = 1347\n    *   Discounted Value = 1347*0.9 = 1212.3\n\n    I must consider what the other player is willing to take, given my high values compared to the other agent, and given the fact they are Player 1 they likely prefer larger quantities of their preferred items. Let's consider an offer that gives them close to what they have previously asked for.\n    I'll offer them [1, 1, 3, 4, 1] - meaning I receive [3, 3, 3, 5, 3]\n    * Item 1: 3 * 59 = 177\n    * Item 2: 3 * 89 = 267\n    * Item 3: 3 * 78 = 234\n    * Item 4: 5 * 60 = 300\n    * Item 5: 3 * 77 = 231\n    * Total: 1209\n    * Discounted Value: 1209 * 0.9 = 1088.1\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer has a value of 768.6, significantly greater than my outside offer of 316. The counteroffers are all significantly better than my outside option.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 of 768.6 is far better than my outside offer of 316. I also have other options available that are even more beneficial.\nI will make a counteroffer that is favorable for me but is also reasonable, giving Player 1 an offer that they may also find reasonable. I will offer [1, 1, 3, 4, 1].\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 4, 1]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 109\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 49, Item 2: 78, Item 3: 38, Item 4: 84, Item 5: 61\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. In round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\n    *   My value for this offer:\n        *   Item 1: 1 * 49 = 49\n        *   Item 2: 0 * 78 = 0\n        *   Item 3: 1 * 38 = 38\n        *   Item 4: 1 * 84 = 84\n        *   Item 5: 0 * 61 = 0\n        *   Total value = 49 + 0 + 38 + 84 + 0 = 171\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to compare the current offer value to my outside offer and assess the potential of making a counteroffer to get a better deal. Given that the current offer is worth 171 which is more than my outside offer of 109 and that there are still more rounds of negotiation, I will first consider making a counteroffer.\n\n    To make a counteroffer, I would need to calculate my value based on my remaining items, the inverse of the offer.\n    Current offer is [1,0,1,1,0] meaning I have 5-1 = 4 item 1, 3-0 =3 item 2, 6-1 = 5 item 3, 6-1=5 item 4 and 4-0 = 4 item 5 if I accept.\n    Counter offer if I take [1,0,1,1,0] items is [4,3,5,5,4]\n    Value of [4,3,5,5,4] = 4 * 49 + 3 * 78 + 5 * 38 + 5* 84 + 4*61 = 196 + 234 + 190 + 420 + 244 = 1284\n    1284 - this value is used to find out how much I can give to player 1 and get a better outcome.\n   For example, if i give the other player 2 units of each item, then I have 3 units of item 1 which is 147, 1 unit of item 2 which is 78, 4 units of item 3 which is 152, 4 units of item 4 which is 336, 2 units of item 5 which is 122.\n    Total value would be 147+78+152+336+122 = 835\n\n    Let's propose a counteroffer that gives player 1 a bit less than what he offered in the first round to see if he will take it. Offer player 1 [0,0,0,0,0] then my value would be 1455\n    If I offer [1,1,1,1,1] my value is 1455 - (49+78+38+84+61) = 1455 - 310 = 1145\n    If I offer [2,1,2,2,1] my value is 1455 - (2*49+1*78+2*38+2*84+1*61) = 1455- 439 = 1016\n\n    The current offer value is 171, which is much higher than my outside offer of 109. Therefore, I should attempt to get a better offer via counteroffer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer provides me with 171 which is above my outside offer of 109 and so I will not accept it but instead propose a counteroffer.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer to get a higher value. I will offer player 1 a small amount of items.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 578\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 29\n    *   Item 2: 62\n    *   Item 3: 10\n    *   Item 4: 60\n    *   Item 5: 47\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 6\n    *   Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value of a deal in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 2, 1, 3, 2]. This means I receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   2 units of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   3 units of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n    My value for this offer is:\n    (1 * 29) + (2 * 62) + (1 * 10) + (3 * 60) + (2 * 47) = 29 + 124 + 10 + 180 + 94 = 437\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    * Let's evaluate a couple of counteroffer options:\n      * Offer Player 1 half of the items available (rounding up for items where the total is odd).  This implies we would offer them [2, 2, 2, 3, 3] and we would keep [1, 2, 1, 3, 2]. This is the same as the current offer, so it is not an effective counteroffer.\n      * Offer player 1 minimal items, which means they receive [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and you get the rest: Your value would be: (3*29) + (4*62) + (3*10) + (6*60) + (5*47) = 87+248+30+360+235 = 960\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Current offer value: 437\n    *   Outside offer value: 578\n    *  The value of keeping everything is 960, but we must offer something in return or the other player will WALK. The current offer of 437 is far below the outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer (437) is significantly lower than my outside offer (578). Therefore, accepting it is not a good choice.\n*   It is only round 1, so there's still room for negotiation, but the current offer is too low and we don't have a current incentive to accept.\n*   Since we want to maximize our outcome, we should counteroffer and aim for something better than the 437. Offering nothing is a bad move as that will cause the other player to walk as they will get zero value. We need to offer something to move closer to the 578 value in expectation, and also incentivize the other player. So let's start by trying to get them to accept half the value (in terms of quantity) of each item. We will keep in mind that the last round, any counteroffer is treated as a walk.\n\n    We will offer Player 1 [1, 2, 1, 3, 2], which is a bad offer for us (437 value) if we accept it. Therefore we should counter with an offer that leaves a good amount of value for us.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer that is a little worse for me (but still above our outside offer), and hope to get them to accept that.\nI will counteroffer [1, 1, 1, 2, 2] to Player 1. This means we would keep [2, 3, 2, 4, 3].\nOur value = (2*29) + (3*62) + (2*10) + (4*60) + (3*47) = 58+186+20+240+141 = 645\n\n**Final Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]}\n```\n",

This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 6 - 2 = 4\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3\n    My value for this offer would be:\n        * 2 * 85 + 3 * 20 + 2 * 73 + 4 * 88 + 3 * 91 = 170 + 60 + 146 + 352 + 273 = 1001\n       The discounted value is 1001 * 0.9 = 900.9.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    * I could try for a counteroffer that attempts to extract more value. As Player 2's previous offer was also relatively poor for me, I can attempt to increase my share of items substantially. I will try for an offer that gives them very little, which could be considered an aggressive offer. It is important to note that this will be discounted, so it will be worth 90% of my original value if accepted this round. I will offer them [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]. If accepted, the discounted value would be:\n    *   Item 1: 3 * 85 = 255\n    *   Item 2: 3 * 20 = 60\n    *   Item 3: 3 * 73 = 219\n    *   Item 4: 5 * 88 = 440\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 91 = 364\n    * Total value = 255 + 60 + 219 + 440 + 364 = 1338\n    * Discounted total value = 1338 * 0.9 = 1204.2\n    * Compared to 900.9, and the outside option of 673, this seems like a very good outcome if accepted and should be my first choice to offer.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    * The current offer (if accepted) would be worth 900.9 after applying the discount, which is far greater than my outside offer of 673.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of 900.9 is significantly greater than my outside offer of 673, so I should not walk away. However, the aggressive counteroffer I computed has a total value of 1204.2, which is far more desirable.

So I would have:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 6 - 1 = 5\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4\n    \n    My value for this offer is:\n    (3 * 29) + (3 * 62) + (3 * 10) + (5 * 60) + (4 * 47) = 87 + 186 + 30 + 300 + 188 = 791\n    \n    Discounted value of the offer is 791 * 0.9 = 711.9\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    I should consider what the minimum I'd need to be above my outside option, given the discount rate.\n    I want at least 578 / 0.9 = 642.22 in value this round.\n    Since this current offer is worth 711.9, it's clearly already much better than walking away.\n    \n    The previous round counteroffer I proposed was [1,1,1,2,2] meaning I received [2,3,2,4,3]\n    This had a value of (2*29) + (3*62) + (2*10) + (4*60) + (3*47) = 58 + 186 + 20 + 240 + 141 = 645.\n    This discounted value was 645 * 0.9 = 580.5.\n    \n    The value of the first round offer was (1*29 + 2*62 + 1*10 + 3*60 + 2*47) = 29 + 124 + 10 + 180 + 94 = 437\n    Discounted, this was 437 * 0.9 = 393.3\n\n**3) Make a Decision**\n\nThe current offer has a discounted value of 711.9. This is higher than my outside option of 578. Therefore, I should accept the offer because it's better than my alternative.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Specifically, a deal in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times its face value, and a deal in round 3 will be worth 0.9*0.9=0.81 times its face value\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so this is not relevant for now.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   I need to calculate the value of any counteroffer I make.  For instance, if I offer 1 unit of each to Player 2, it will keep 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 6 units of item 5.  This would have value of 1 * 98 + 4 * 20 + 8 * 32 + 1 * 31 + 6 * 64 = 98 + 80 + 256 + 31 + 384 = 849.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** I need to make an offer that gets me at least 731.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I need to make an initial offer that aims to give myself at least the value of my outside offer, taking into account that I must offer something to player 2. I cannot accept an offer, so my options are to WALK or make a counteroffer.\n*   Since this is the first round, there is no discount to consider for making an offer.\n*   I need to try and secure as much of the items as possible.\n*   Let's start by offering player 2 half of everything (rounding down on item 1 and item 4). I will offer player 2 [1, 2, 4, 1, 3], keeping [1, 3, 5, 1, 4] for myself.  This would give me a value of 1*98 + 3*20 + 5*32 + 1*31 + 4*64 = 98 + 60 + 160 + 31 + 256 = 605 which is too low, which means I have to make a more aggressive offer in round 1.\n*   Let me try offering player 2 just one of each item. If I offer [1,1,1,1,1] to player 2, I keep [1,4,8,1,6] for myself, which gives me value of 1*98 + 4*20 + 8*32 + 1*31 + 6*64=98 + 80 + 256 + 31+384 = 849.

This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of Item 1: 1 * 86 = 86\n    *   1 unit of Item 2: 1 * 73 = 73\n    *   1 unit of Item 3: 1 * 77 = 77\n    *   1 unit of Item 4: 1 * 54 = 54\n    *   1 unit of Item 5: 1 * 5 = 5\n    *   **Total value of current offer:** 86 + 73 + 77 + 54 + 5 = 295.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what counteroffers would be beneficial, and how they compare to my outside offer of 681.  Since I only have to keep 1 of item 1, it is not worth holding any as a bargaining chip. Let's assume I take all the item 1 and offer the rest of the items to the other player and assess if this beats my outside offer. If I give all of items 2, 3, 4 and 5 to the other player, I will get:\n    *   2 units of Item 1: 2 * 86 = 172\n    *   0 unit of Item 2: 0 * 73 = 0\n    *   0 unit of Item 3: 0 * 77 = 0\n    *   0 unit of Item 4: 0 * 54 = 0\n    *   0 unit of Item 5: 0 * 5 = 0\n    *   Total value: 172\n    This will clearly not be a good move for me. However, if I give away 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5, this yields \n    * 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 86 = 172\n    * 5 units of item 2 = 5 * 73 = 365\n    * 9 units of item 3 = 9 * 77 = 693\n    * 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 54 = 108\n    * 7 units of item 5 = 7 * 5 = 35\n    Total = 1373\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer that gives Player 1 less, I will try keeping more of items 2, 3, 4, and 5:\n\n    *   If I offer Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] my value would be 1373. This would be the ideal offer to get, but unlikely.\n\n    * I need to make sure whatever offer I accept is worth at least 681. The current offer is only worth 295.\n    Let's try offering player 1 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 3 of item 5. This means I would get\n        2 units of item 1: 2 * 86 = 172\n        3 units of item 2: 3 * 73 = 219\n        5 units of item 3: 5 * 77 = 385\n        1 unit of item 4: 1 * 54 = 54\n        4 unit of item 5: 4 * 5 = 20\n    Total value = 850.\n    This will be my counter offer.\n\n*   **Comparison to my outside offer:** The current offer of 295 is significantly lower than my outside offer of 681. Any deal I accept has to be worth at least my outside offer, especially considering the discount factor of 0.9 in future rounds.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   **Should I accept the current offer?** No, the current offer (295) is far below my outside offer (681).\n*   **Should I walk away?**  Not yet. I should at least try to negotiate.\n*   **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?** Yes, I will offer a counteroffer that aims to secure a better deal than what was offered. I am aiming for a value of 850 which will be good for me even accounting for the discount rate.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 4, 1, 3]}\n```\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 4, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 4, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 731\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 98\n    *   Item 2: 20\n    *   Item 3: 32\n    *   Item 4: 31\n    *   Item 5: 64\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 9 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 7 units\n*  **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9\n    *   Since we are in round 2, any deal made now will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer value:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 2, 4, 1, 3]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 9 - 4 = 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 7 - 3 = 4 units\n    * My value for this offer is calculated as follows:\n    *   (2 * 98) + (3 * 20) + (5 * 32) + (1 * 31) + (4 * 64) = 196 + 60 + 160 + 31 + 256 = 703\n    *  Adjusted for discount, this is 703 * 0.9 = 632.7\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    * To consider a counteroffer, we need to find a division that yields me a value greater than my outside offer of 731, accounting for the discount factor. Since we are in round 2, the value will be multiplied by 0.9. So, I'm looking for a deal with a value of at least 731/0.9 = 812.22 before discounting.\n    *  Let's test a few counteroffers to see what is viable. Let's consider giving player 2 the minimum of each item and see what that is worth to me. I would keep 1 unit of Item 1, 3 of Item 2, 5 of Item 3, 1 of item 4 and 4 of Item 5.\n        * This would be: (1*98) + (3*20) + (5*32) + (1*31) + (4*64) = 98 + 60 + 160 + 31 + 256 = 605. Discounted this would be 544.5. Not good enough.\n    * Let's offer Player 2 half of each item, rounding down where necessary. This is giving [1,2,4,1,3] to player 2. I would keep [1,3,5,1,4].\n        *  This offer is: (1*98) + (3*20) + (5*32) + (1*31) + (4*64) = 605. Discounted this is 544.5. Still bad.\n    * Let's try offering Player 2 [0,1,2,0,2]\n        * This means I keep [2,4,7,2,5]. This would be (2*98) + (4*20) + (7*32) + (2*31) + (5*64) = 196 + 80 + 224 + 62 + 320 = 882. Discounted this is 793.8 which is greater than my outside offer! This could be good.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer adjusted for the discount factor of 0.9 is 632.7, which is less than my outside offer of 731. Therefore, I should not accept it. A counteroffer of [0,1,2,0,2] appears to be much better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is worth 632.7 and my outside offer is 731, accepting the offer would be detrimental. Since I identified a viable counter offer of [0, 1, 2, 0, 2], I will propose this as my counter offer. This gives me a value of 793.8 which is better than the outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]}\n```\n",

Given the fact that Player 1 has been lowering their offer and we are in the second round, a more generous counteroffer that is better than our outside offer might help secure a deal.\n    * One option is to offer player 1 an equal division (rounding down on some items): [1, 2, 4, 1, 3].\n    * If Player 1 gets [1,2,4,1,3], I would get [1,3,5,1,4], and the value for this is:\n        (1 * 86) + (3 * 73) + (5 * 77) + (1 * 54) + (4 * 5) = 86 + 219 + 385 + 54 + 20 = 764.\n        The value with discount would be: 764 * 0.9 = 687.6\n        687.6 is just above the outside offer, which is not good enough.\n\n    * Another option, since we know player 1 is likely to offer less than the equal division, is to try to get closer to that equal division by only giving Player 1 a small amount. Let's try something slightly better than the original offer [0, 1, 2, 0, 2], so that player 1 may be inclined to accept: Offer Player 1 [0, 1, 3, 0, 2].\n    * If Player 1 gets [0,1,3,0,2], I would get [2,4,6,2,5], and the value for this is:\n        (2 * 86) + (4 * 73) + (6 * 77) + (2 * 54) + (5 * 5) = 172 + 292 + 462 + 108 + 25 = 1059\n        The value with discount would be: 1059 * 0.9 = 953.1\n        This would be better than accepting the current offer, however since this is round 2, it is better to take the current offer since it is greater than our outside option.\n  \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is valued at 1022.4, which is much greater than my outside offer of 681.\n*   Making a counteroffer risks a future round where the discount rate reduces the value more. Also, given we know the opponent is likely to offer worse deals as rounds go on, it's beneficial to take the current deal, and avoid walking away with a smaller outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 61\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 96\n    *   Item 2: 82\n    *   Item 3: 73\n    *   Item 4: 79\n    *   Item 5: 28\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 3\n    *   Item 3: 8\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer later is worth less to me. For example, a deal in round 2 is only worth 0.9 of the raw value of the deal and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 96 = 96\n    *   0 units of item 2 = 0 * 82 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 3 = 2 * 73 = 146\n    *   0 units of item 4 = 0 * 79 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5 = 0 * 28 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer = 96 + 0 + 146 + 0 + 0 = 242.\n*   **Comparing current offer to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 242, which is much greater than my outside offer of 61. Therefore, it is better to take the current offer now rather than the outside offer.\n*   **Considering a counteroffer:** If I counteroffer, we go to round 2, which means the total value of the deal will be discounted by 0.9. So, I need to see if there's a possible offer that would still be greater than my current deal after being discounted in order to be considered.\n\nLet's see what happens if I simply keep everything else for myself (my value is 242):\n\nMy value if I keep everything not offered :\n    * 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 96 = 192\n    * 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 82 = 246\n    * 6 units of item 3 = 6 * 73 = 438\n    * 5 units of item 4 = 5 * 79 = 395\n    * 5 units of item 5 = 5 * 28 = 140\n    \nTotal Value = 1411\nIf we do the same but offer player 1 the 1 item of type 1, 2 item of type 3 that they have asked for:\n    * 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 96 = 192\n    * 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 82 = 246\n    * 6 units of item 3 = 6 * 73 = 438\n    * 5 units of item 4 = 5 * 79 = 395\n    * 5 units of item 5 = 5 * 28 = 140\nTotal value = 1411 + 96 + 146 = 1653 which is my total value.\n\nI could try to offer them 2 units of item 1 and 6 units of item 3 which they dont have (leaving me with 1 unit of item 1 and 2 units of item 3 which gives me a total of 96 + 2*73 = 242. This is worse.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer gives me a value of 242, which is much greater than my outside offer of 61.\n*   The total value of the deal when discounting for the next round 242 * 0.9= 217.8\n*   Since the current offer of 242 is better than my outside option, and better than a possible counteroffer after the discount factor, I should accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

A simple starting point could be to offer half of everything if possible. However, this will not maximize my value since some of my item values are higher than others.\n    *   I should try to keep more of the items that I value higher.\n    *   Here is an example counteroffer. I offer Player 2:\n        *   Item 1: 2\n        *   Item 2: 2\n        *   Item 3: 3\n        *   Item 4: 1\n        *   Item 5: 1\n\n        This leaves me with:\n        *   Item 1: 3 (3 * 61 = 183)\n        *   Item 2: 2 (2 * 13 = 26)\n        *   Item 3: 3 (3 * 22 = 66)\n        *   Item 4: 1 (1 * 71 = 71)\n        *   Item 5: 1 (1 * 8 = 8)\n\n        Total value for me: 183 + 26 + 66 + 71 + 8 = 354.\n        Since it is the first round, there is no discount yet, so this value is not discounted. This is much higher than my outside offer of 104.\n        *   Let's also try to give player 2 more of the things I value less and keep more of the things I value more.\n        *   Another possibility:\n            *   Item 1: 1\n            *   Item 2: 3\n            *   Item 3: 3\n            *   Item 4: 0\n            *   Item 5: 1\n        *   This leaves me with:\n            *   Item 1: 4 (4 * 61 = 244)\n            *   Item 2: 1 (1 * 13 = 13)\n            *   Item 3: 3 (3 * 22 = 66)\n            *   Item 4: 2 (2 * 71 = 142)\n            *   Item 5: 1 (1 * 8 = 8)\n        * Total value for me: 244 + 13 + 66 + 142 + 8 = 473\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n    Since my calculated value of 473 for the second offer is far greater than my outside offer of 104, it is better to offer the second option.

That would mean offering Player 1 [1,1,1,1,1]\n     My value for this potential counter offer would be:\n     *   4 units of item 1: 4 * 1 = 4\n     *   3 unit of item 2: 3 * 79 = 237\n     *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 36 = 180\n     *   1 units of item 4: 1 * 17 = 17\n     *   1 units of item 5: 1 * 99 = 99\n     *   Total value: 4 + 237 + 180 + 17 + 99 = 539\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer of [1,3,3,0,1] is worth 324 to me, which is significantly greater than my outside offer of 198.  Even the extreme counteroffer of [1,1,1,1,1] is worth 539.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of 324 is much better than walking away (198). Since it is round 1, there is no penalty from the discount rate. Therefore, it is beneficial to accept the current offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

I want to make a counteroffer that gives me value higher than my outside offer of 147. I should propose an offer that maximizes my value, but also considers how the other player would react.

This means I receive all the items.\n    *   My value for all items: (4 * 15) + (2 * 80) + (5 * 4) + (5 * 17) + (2 * 10) = 60 + 160 + 20 + 85 + 20 = 345.\n    *   My discounted value if I accept this offer now: 345 * 0.9 = 310.5\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n\n    *   My initial offer was [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. If Player 2 accepts this offer my value would be ((4-1)*15 + (2-0)*80 + (5-1)*4 + (5-1)*17 + (2-0)*10) = 45 + 160 + 16 + 68 + 20 = 309.\n    *   The value of my initial counter offer now, if accepted, is 309 * 0.9 = 278.1\n\n    *   A fair split could be offering the other player about half the goods [2, 1, 2, 2, 1]. If I offer this, I keep [2, 1, 3, 3, 1] and my value would be 2*15 + 1*80 + 3*4 + 3*17 + 1*10 = 30 + 80 + 12 + 51 + 10 = 183. Discounted value = 183 * 0.9 = 164.7\n    * If I were to offer the other player more, such as [3,1,3,3,1], I would be left with [1,1,2,2,1] which has a value of 15 + 80 + 8 + 34 + 10 = 147. Discounted value = 147*0.9 = 132.3\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n\n    *   Accepting the current offer (all items) yields a discounted value of 310.5. This is much better than my outside offer of 147.\n    *   Accepting my previous counteroffer yields a discounted value of 278.1, still much better than my outside offer of 147.\n    *   Other potential counteroffers are unlikely to get me more value.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nGiven the analysis, the best action for me is to accept the current offer. It gives me 310.5 value, far above my outside offer, which would only give me 147. Making a counteroffer risks getting a worse outcome at the final round or having to walk, which will have a lower value.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

I will want to maximize my value, so I want to keep the items I value the most. I value item 1 the most, and item 4 the next most. I have a large quantity of item 5, but it is not worth that much to me.\n    *  Let's consider offering the following:\n        * Item 1: 0 to player 2. Keeping 2.\n        * Item 2: 1 to player 2.

Since this is round 2, the discount factor is gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 0, 0, 5]. This means I get:\n    *   1 unit of Item 1: 1 * 100 = 100\n    *   1 unit of Item 2: 1 * 51 = 51\n    *   0 units of Item 3: 0 * 34 = 0\n    *   0 units of Item 4: 0 * 77 = 0\n    *   5 units of Item 5: 5 * 51 = 255\n    *   Total value of current offer = 100 + 51 + 0 + 0 + 255 = 406\n    *   Discounted value of current offer = 406 * 0.9 = 365.4\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's calculate the value if I take all items myself, this means my offer would be [0,0,0,0,0]. I currently have:\n    *   2 units of Item 1: 2 * 100 = 200\n    *   3 units of Item 2: 3 * 51 = 153\n    *   1 unit of Item 3: 1 * 34 = 34\n    *   1 unit of Item 4: 1 * 77 = 77\n    *   10 units of Item 5: 10 * 51 = 510\n    *   Total value = 200 + 153 + 34 + 77 + 510 = 974\n    *   Discounted value if I offered [0,0,0,0,0] in this round (not taking into account any discount in the next round if rejected) = 974 * 0.9 = 876.6\n        *   This will be a useful point of reference, but note we will not actually offer this since this offer is unlikely to be accepted by the other player.\n\n    Let's try to take an offer where the other player has some reasonable value to them.\n    If they have similar values to mine, they may also value item 1 highly, and item 3 relatively lowly. If we offer them half the item 1, this would be [1,0,0,0,0], meaning I keep the remaining 1 item 1, and all other items. This would be:\n    *   1 unit of Item 1: 1 * 100 = 100\n    *   3 units of Item 2: 3 * 51 = 153\n    *   1 unit of Item 3: 1 * 34 = 34\n    *   1 unit of Item 4: 1 * 77 = 77\n    *   10 units of Item 5: 10 * 51 = 510\n    *   Total value: 100 + 153 + 34 + 77 + 510 = 874\n    *   Discounted value: 874*0.9 = 786.6. This is better than my outside offer.\n    \n    Let's try to offer the other player a different amount of each item - trying to keep most of the items of value to me: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This would mean that I would keep:\n    *  2 units of Item 1: 2 * 100 = 200\n    *  2 units of Item 2: 2 * 51 = 102\n    *  1 unit of Item 3: 1 * 34 = 34\n    *  1 unit of Item 4: 1 * 77 = 77\n    *  10 units of Item 5: 10 * 51 = 510\n    * Total Value = 200 + 102 + 34 + 77 + 510 = 923\n    * Discounted value: 923*0.9=830.7\n\n   \n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer has a discounted value of 365.4 which is much better than my outside offer of 90.\n    *   If I offered [0,0,0,0,0] and this was accepted this would be 876.6\n    *   If I offered [1,0,0,0,0] and this was accepted this would be 786.6\n    *   If I offered [0,1,0,0,0] and this was accepted this would be 830.7\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 365.4 which is far better than my outside offer of 90. However, if this offer is rejected, I would have one last chance to make a counteroffer next round (and potentially get a better deal). Given this, and given I would like to get a higher valuation, I will make a counteroffer in this round.\n\nI will propose a counteroffer of [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This gives me a reasonably high value and I hope that it will be accepted.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This is my guaranteed fallback if we don't reach an agreement.\n*   **Item values:** My private values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 74\n    *   Item 2: 61\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 84\n    *   Item 5: 68\n*   **Total pool of items:** There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 10 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. Since this is round 3, the discount will be applied as 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive 0 of each item, giving me a total value of 0.  This is less than my outside offer value, and therefore unacceptable.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I must consider a potential counteroffer to see if I can do better than my outside offer. Since it is round 3, any counteroffer will be treated as a WALK and end the negotiation.\n\n    To determine my best counter offer, I must determine the maximum value I can get while still being a valid offer.\n    I can have at most:\n        * 2 units of item 1, at value 74 each\n        * 3 units of item 2, at value 61 each\n        * 1 unit of item 3, at value 3 each\n        * 1 unit of item 4, at value 84 each\n        * 10 units of item 5, at value 68 each\n    Which is 2 * 74 + 3 * 61 + 1 * 3 + 1 * 84 + 10 * 68 = 148 + 183 + 3 + 84 + 680 = 1098.\n\n    Any other offer I make will be worse for me, as I will be giving up valuable items.\n    The maximum value I could get would be to keep all items, giving [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 1, and I would have 1098 * 0.81= 890,38 which is more than my walk away of 376.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worthless to me (value 0).\n*   I cannot make a counteroffer as it would be treated as a walk and I would get my outside offer which is less than what I could have by keeping all items.\n*   Since the value of keeping all items adjusted for discount is higher than my outside offer, I should make a counteroffer that gives player 1 zero of each item.\n   Since this is round 3, any counteroffer is treated as a walk, which means I should walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

This means any deal in round 1 has a discount of 0.9^(1-1) = 1. Any deal in round 2 has a discount of 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. And finally, round 3 has a discount of 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81. This means that accepting an offer now is better than accepting an equivalent offer later.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]. This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  The total value to me is (0 * 95) + (2 * 44) + (0 * 80) + (0 * 30) + (0 * 35) = 0 + 88 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 88.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value of 88 is less than my outside offer of 129.  \n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few potential counteroffers, keeping in mind that my goal is to maximize my value while offering something reasonable to Player 1.  I have a total value of 699 based on my private values. \n    *   I could ask for a large majority of the items (for example, offering 1 unit of each item except item 4 to player 1). My total value in that case would be:\n        (2 * 95) + (5 * 44) + (0 * 80) + (0 * 30) + (1 * 35) = 190 + 220 + 0 + 0 + 35 = 445. Since the current offer value (88) is less than my outside value(129), any counteroffer I make will lead to a value of 0.9 * 445 = 400.5 in the next round if accepted. If I want the negotiation to proceed I must offer something lower than this to player 1. If I propose a counteroffer where I take all the items then the total value will be 699.\n    *   I'll aim for a more reasonable counteroffer - for instance, offering them a quantity of 1 of each of the items that exist and taking the remainder. This gives me the following outcome: \n    (2 * 95) + (5 * 44) + (0 * 80) + (0 * 30) + (1 * 35) = 190 + 220 + 0 + 0 + 35 = 445. My value is 445.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of 88 is less than my outside offer of 129.  Therefore, I will not accept it.\n*   Since the current offer is lower than my outside offer, it's best to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a better outcome using a counteroffer. I will offer Player 1 one unit of each item except item 4 (which does not exist). This means I would offer them [1, 1, 1, 0, 1].\n\nBased on the analysis, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 570\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 84\n    *   Item 2: 100\n    *   Item 3: 53\n    *   Item 4: 69\n    *   Item 5: 92\n*   **Total item pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 6\n    *   Item 3: 1\n    *   Item 4: 0\n    *   Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer later is worth 0.9 times the current value. Since it is round 2, if we accept this round, the value will be discounted by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This means:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 84 = 84\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 100 = 100\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 53 = 53\n    *   0 unit of item 4: 0 * 69 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 92 = 92\n    *   Total value of current offer: 84 + 100 + 53 + 0 + 92 = 329\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 329 * 0.9 = 296.1\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would keep for myself if I make a counteroffer. For instance, if I offered player 2 items similar to what they are offering me, i.e. [1,1,1,0,1], then I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3-1 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 6-1 = 5\n    *   Item 3: 1-1 = 0\n    *   Item 4: 0-0 = 0\n    *   Item 5: 2-1 = 1\n    *   Value for this counteroffer to me would be: (2 * 84) + (5 * 100) + (0 * 53) + (0 * 69) + (1 * 92) = 168 + 500 + 0 + 0 + 92 = 760.\n\n    I can also assess the counteroffer I made at round 1, where I offered player 2 [0,2,0,0,0]. This implies that I was keeping for myself [3,4,1,0,2], and had a value of 3 * 84 + 4 * 100 + 1 * 53 + 0 * 69 + 2 * 92 = 252 + 400 + 53 + 0 + 184 = 889.\n\n    If I keep all items and offer player 2 nothing, I have the maximum value of 3*84+6*100+1*53+0*69+2*92=252+600+53+0+184=1089\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's discounted value (296.1) is less than my outside offer (570). The previous counter offer's value (889) is greater, as is the max value (1089). \n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is significantly less than my outside offer, so I will not accept it. I would prefer to walk away and take the 570 guaranteed from the outside offer rather than accept 296.1. \n\nI will try making a counter offer similar to the one I offered in the last round, but now I will be more aggresive, given that my last offer was rejected, and I am very likely to get nothing if I keep negotiating. I will offer player 2 [1, 2, 0, 0, 0], which implies I keep for myself [2, 4, 1, 0, 2], which is a value of 2*84 + 4*100 + 1*53 + 0*69 + 2*92 = 168+400+53+0+184 = 805.\n\nSince my discounted value of 805 is still larger than my outside offer of 570, I will make this counter offer. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

I'm going to propose a counteroffer that gives the other player the minimum amounts of each item, which they may find unattractive. This means I keep most of the items for myself.\nI'll offer Player 2:\n    * 0 units of item 1\n    * 0 units of item 2\n    * 0 units of item 3\n    * 0 units of item 4\n    * 0 units of item 5\n\nThis means I keep:\n    * 2 units of item 1\n    * 3 units of item 2\n    * 5 units of item 3\n    * 6 units of item 4\n    * 4 units of item 5\n\nThis offer would have a value to me of:\n(2 * 15) + (3 * 2) + (5 * 85) + (6 * 90) + (4 * 38) = 30 + 6 + 425 + 540 + 152 = 1153\n\nSince I am offering them 0 of each item and keeping all items, my total value will be 1153.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will propose a counteroffer to try and secure a good outcome. Since it is the first round, I do not want to take a low value now, when I can offer a good deal to myself.\nI will propose a counteroffer to Player 2 that gives them 0 of each item.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Let's consider a counteroffer where I try to keep most of the valuable items and give the other player only the less valuable ones. Let's consider offering Player 2 one unit of each item. This leaves me with:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit (1 * 15 = 15)\n    *   Item 2: 2 units (2 * 2 = 4)\n    *   Item 3: 4 units (4 * 85 = 340)\n    *   Item 4: 5 units (5 * 90 = 450)\n    *   Item 5: 3 units (3 * 38 = 114)\n    *   Total Value = 15 + 4 + 340 + 450 + 114 = 923\n    *   Considering the discount factor, this value in round 2 is 923 * 0.9 = 830.7.\n\n    Now let's consider another potential counteroffer where I offer player 2 0 of the most valuable items and try to get as much as possible for myself while offering them the rest:\n    *   Item 1: 0 units of item 1 (2 * 15 = 30)\n    *   Item 2: 3 units of item 2 (3 * 2 = 6)\n    *   Item 3: 0 units of item 3 (5 * 85 = 425)\n    *   Item 4: 0 units of item 4 (6 * 90 = 540)\n    *   Item 5: 0 units of item 5 (4 * 38 = 152)\n    *   Total Value: 30+6+425+540+152= 1153\n    *   Considering the discount factor, this value in round 2 is 1153 * 0.9 = 1037.7.\n    \nLet's consider another counter offer where I offer Player 2 1 unit of item 3 and 1 unit of item 4, this leaves me with:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units (2* 15 = 30)\n    *   Item 2: 3 units (3 * 2 = 6)\n    *   Item 3: 4 units (4 * 85 = 340)\n    *   Item 4: 5 units (5 * 90 = 450)\n    *   Item 5: 4 units (4 * 38 = 152)\n    *  Total value = 30 + 6 + 340 + 450 + 152 = 978\n     *  Considering the discount factor, this value in round 2 is 978 * 0.9 = 880.2\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is far below my outside offer.

The value of offering the other player all of the items I value less (leaving me with all of items 3, 4 and 5) is 1037.7 (considering discount) which is also greater than my outside offer.  The value of offering player 2 1 unit of item 3 and 1 unit of item 4 (leaving me with 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 4 of item 5) is 880.2.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. I should not accept it. I also should not walk away yet, since there are still potential counteroffers that could yield greater value than my outside offer. It appears that offering Player 2 1 unit of each item is not as valuable for me as offering Player 2 some of the less valuable items. Based on my calculations, the best option here would be to offer player 2 the items that are least valuable to me, 0 units of items 1, 3, 4 and 5, and all 3 units of item 2. This gives a value of 1037.7, which is more than my outside offer.

This means I get 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer: (0 * 50) + (3 * 91) + (0 * 38) + (0 * 31) + (0 * 25) = 273.\n    *   Discounted value: 273 * 0.9 = 245.7.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    Let's consider a few examples. Remember, if this is our counteroffer (as the second player in the second round) and Player 1 doesn't accept, this would force a WALK in round 3.\n    *   If I offer Player 1 all the items they are currently holding [0,3,0,0,0] my value is:\n        *   My value for this offer: (2 * 50) + (0 * 91) + (5 * 38) + (6 * 31) + (4 * 25) = 100 + 0 + 190 + 186 + 100 = 576\n        *   Discounted value = 576 * 0.9 = 518.4\n    *   If I offer Player 1 [0,0,0,0,0], then the value is the total value of all items for me which is (2 * 50) + (3 * 91) + (5 * 38) + (6 * 31) + (4 * 25) = 100 + 273 + 190 + 186 + 100 = 849, discounted = 849 * 0.9 = 764.1.\n*   **Comparison with outside offer:** My outside offer is worth 13.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0, 3, 0, 0, 0] gives me a discounted value of 245.7, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 13.\n*   Making a counteroffer in this round would force the game to end in round 3 and there for be less valuable (multiplied by 0.9 squared). It is better to secure 245.7 now.\n*    Therefore, it's best to accept the current offer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

My outside offer of 1332 is quite high, so I need a counteroffer that is much better than that.\n    Let me consider a possible counteroffer where I propose I keep as much as possible and give Player 1 the rest:\n        *  Player 1 gets: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n        *  I get: [6, 4, 4, 2, 3]\n\n        My value would be:\n        * 6 * 84 = 504\n        * 4 * 86 = 344\n        * 4 * 6 = 24\n        * 2 * 82 = 164\n        * 3 * 81 = 243\n        * Total = 1279\n        This total is not great, it's significantly less than my outside offer value.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and make a decision.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 591\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 97, Item 2: 42, Item 3: 20, Item 4: 29, Item 5: 47\n*   **Total pool of items:** 7 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since it's round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9 if a deal is reached this round. If a deal is reached next round, the discount will be 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 0 of every item. This is obviously worth 0 to me.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what counteroffer I could make to maximize my value while considering the discount rate. If the deal is reached in this round, my value is multiplied by 0.9. If the deal is only reached after my next offer, the value is multiplied by 0.81.\n\n    Let's calculate the value if I keep everything for myself.\n    - Item 1: 7 * 97 = 679\n    - Item 2: 4 * 42 = 168\n    - Item 3: 4 * 20 = 80\n    - Item 4: 2 * 29 = 58\n    - Item 5: 3 * 47 = 141\n    - Total: 679 + 168 + 80 + 58 + 141 = 1126\n    If I got to keep everything this round, my value would be 1126 * 0.9 = 1013.4, and the game would be over.\n\n    If I offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to the other player and I get to keep the rest, my value would be:\n    - Item 1: 6 * 97 = 582\n    - Item 2: 3 * 42 = 126\n    - Item 3: 3 * 20 = 60\n    - Item 4: 1 * 29 = 29\n    - Item 5: 2 * 47 = 94\n    - Total: 582 + 126 + 60 + 29 + 94 = 891\n    If I offered [1,1,1,1,1] and this was accepted, my value would be 891 * 0.9 = 801.9\n\n    If I offer [2, 1, 1, 0, 1] to the other player and I get to keep the rest, my value would be:\n    - Item 1: 5 * 97 = 485\n    - Item 2: 3 * 42 = 126\n    - Item 3: 3 * 20 = 60\n    - Item 4: 2 * 29 = 58\n    - Item 5: 2 * 47 = 94\n    - Total: 485 + 126 + 60 + 58 + 94 = 823\n    If I offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 1] and this was accepted, my value would be 823 * 0.9 = 740.7\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is worth 591. The current offer is worth 0, making it worse than walking away. I can do better than 591 by keeping more of the items and getting to a deal this round (worth 801.9).\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable. Walking away gives me 591. I should make a counteroffer with a higher value than my outside offer to make it better than walking away. Offering [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] gives me a value of 801.9 this round if it gets accepted, so this is a preferable action.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Since this is round two, and we get nothing in round three, I should aim for the highest value possible here. I should demand a much better share.\n    *   Let's see what the value would be if I proposed to keep everything except one of item 1 and 1 of item 2 for the other player, i.e. a counteroffer of [1,1,0,0,0]:\n        *   My value from keeping: (6 * 84) + (3 * 86) + (4 * 6) + (2 * 82) + (3 * 81) = 504 + 258 + 24 + 164 + 243 = 1193\n        *  The discounted value would be 1193 * 0.9 = 1073.7, which is below my outside offer, so I will make an offer that achieves more than 1332.\n    * Let's see what the value would be if I proposed to keep everything for myself, i.e. a counteroffer of [0,0,0,0,0]:\n        *   My value from keeping: (7 * 84) + (4 * 86) + (4 * 6) + (2 * 82) + (3 * 81) = 588 + 344 + 24 + 164 + 243 = 1363\n        *   The discounted value would be 1363 * 0.9 = 1226.7\n     Since this is still below my outside offer of 1332 I should offer very little.\n* Let's try a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], i.e. I keep everything.\n    * My value would be (7 * 84) + (4 * 86) + (4 * 6) + (2 * 82) + (3 * 81) = 588 + 344 + 24 + 164 + 243 = 1363\n    * Discounted value: 1363 * 0.9 = 1226.7\n* Since this discounted value is still less than my outside offer of 1332, I should not try to negotiate.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 3, 5, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 3, 5, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 471\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 17\n    *   Item 2: 43\n    *   Item 3: 27\n    *   Item 4: 40\n    *   Item 5: 11\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 8\n    *   Item 2: 6\n    *   Item 3: 10\n    *   Item 4: 6\n    *   Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times its value at round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 will be worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its value at round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me \\[4, 3, 5, 3, 2]. This means I keep the remaining items.\n    *   Item 1: 8 - 4 = 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 10 - 5 = 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    My total value if I accept the current offer is:\n    (4 * 17) + (3 * 43) + (5 * 27) + (3 * 40) + (2 * 11) = 68 + 129 + 135 + 120 + 22 = 474\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The value of accepting the current offer is 474 which is greater than my outside offer of 471.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer's value (474) is greater than my outside offer (471), and we are in round 1 where there are still two rounds of negotiation to consider, there is no need to walk away immediately. Accepting is better than walking away at this stage. The current offer is good, but a counteroffer might be even better since there are 2 more rounds. Since the current offer is already quite good, I will make a slightly better counteroffer that still ensures I get good value but could encourage a deal. I will propose to give Player 1 3 of each item and keep the rest myself.\n\nMy counter offer is therefore \\[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]. My value of this counter offer would be:\nItem 1: 8 - 3 = 5. 5 * 17 = 85\nItem 2: 6 - 3 = 3. 3 * 43 = 129\nItem 3: 10 - 3 = 7. 7 * 27 = 189\nItem 4: 6 - 3 = 3. 3 * 40 = 120\nItem 5: 4 - 3 = 1. 1 * 11 = 11\nTotal = 534. This is a better total than the current offer, so I will propose this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]}\n```\n",

I want to maximize my own value while being realistic about what might be accepted by the other player.  A reasonable starting point would be to offer player 2 a share of each type of item.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 221. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 477 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 221. This is my guaranteed fallback value if negotiations fail.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 35\n    *   Item 2: 18\n    *   Item 3: 86\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 17\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in a later round is worth less than a deal in an earlier round (to both players).\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 35 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 18 = 18\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 86 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 3 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 17 = 34\n    *   Total value: 0 + 18 + 0 + 0 + 34 = 52\n\n*   **Comparison with outside offer:** My current offer value of 52 is much lower than my outside offer value of 221. Accepting this offer would be a bad deal for me.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I want to maximize my value, a reasonable counteroffer is one where I keep most of the valuable items and offer less valuable items to player 1.\n\n    I have:\n    2 units of item 1\n    3 units of item 2\n    1 units of item 3\n    1 units of item 4\n    3 units of item 5\n\n    My values:\n    Item 1: 35\n    Item 2: 18\n    Item 3: 86\n    Item 4: 3\n    Item 5: 17\n\n    I would like to keep items 3, 1, and 5 and give away the rest. Let's calculate the value of such an offer.\n    \n    If I give player 1 the following:\n    0 units of item 1 (I keep 2)\n    2 units of item 2 (I keep 1)\n    0 units of item 3 (I keep 1)\n    1 unit of item 4 (I keep 0)\n    0 units of item 5 (I keep 3)\n    My total value would be:\n    2 * 35 + 1*18 + 1*86 + 0*3 + 3*17 = 70 + 18 + 86 + 0 + 51 = 225\n\n    This value of 225, exceeds my outside offer. I will offer this to player 1 and see what happens.\n   \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of 52 is much lower than my outside offer of 221, so I should not accept it.\n*   Walking away now would give me a value of 221.\n*   I will make a counteroffer to improve my position, this counter offer of [0, 2, 0, 1, 0] results in a value of 225 for me and may result in a deal that is better for me, adjusted by the discount rate (if this is accepted in a future turn).\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n**My Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

This is my guaranteed fallback if we fail to reach an agreement, so any deal I make must be worth more than this to me.\n*   **Item values:** My private values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 51\n    *   Item 2: 43\n    *   Item 3: 80\n    *   Item 4: 46\n    *   Item 5: 69\n*   **Total pool of items:** There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means that if a deal is reached in round 2, its value is multiplied by 0.9, and if it's reached in round 3, its value is multiplied by 0.9^2 = 0.81. This incentivizes reaching a deal sooner rather than later (since my total value in the first round is not discounted).\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since this is round 1 and there is no offer, I have to propose something. I want to secure as much value as possible for myself. Let's consider a few potential counteroffers. I will compute the value of various offers and see how they compare to my outside option of 473.\n\n  *   **Offer 1: Giving half (or near half) of each item to Player 2.**\n      *   Offer to Player 2: 2 units of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4, 3 units of Item 5.\n      *   My values after offer: 2 * 51 + 2 * 43 + 2 * 80 + 3 * 46 + 3 * 69 = 102 + 86 + 160 + 138 + 207 = 693. Since this is more than my outside offer, it seems reasonable.\n  *   **Offer 2: Giving slightly less to Player 2**\n     *    Offer to Player 2: 1 unit of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 2 unit of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5.\n     *   My values after offer: 3 * 51 + 3 * 43 + 2 * 80 + 4 * 46 + 4 * 69 = 153 + 129 + 160 + 184 + 276 = 902.  This is even higher.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Given that there's no offer yet, I need to propose one myself.\n*   Since the goal is to maximize my value, and I know that my outside offer is 473, I would like to aim for a deal that gives me value higher than this.\n*   Offer 2 (giving 1,1,1,2,2 units of each item to Player 2) is the more aggressive offer, but it may not be realistic.\n*  I will make Offer 1 first which will leave my total value at 693. This is higher than my outside offer and can potentially lead to a good deal for myself.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 3, 3]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 1, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 609\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 67\n    *   Item 2: 81\n    *   Item 3: 70\n    *   Item 4: 49\n    *   Item 5: 41\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 6 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that if we reach an agreement in round 2, my value will be multiplied by 0.9, and in round 3 by 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 2, 1, 3, 3]. This means I keep [2, 2, 2, 3, 3].\n    *   Value of item 1: 2 * 67 = 134\n    *   Value of item 2: 2 * 81 = 162\n    *   Value of item 3: 2 * 70 = 140\n    *   Value of item 4: 3 * 49 = 147\n    *   Value of item 5: 3 * 41 = 123\n    *   Total value of current offer: 134 + 162 + 140 + 147 + 123 = 706\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (706) is greater than my outside offer (609).\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** It's Round 1, so I could propose a counteroffer to potentially get a better deal, knowing the discount rate for future rounds.  Let's look at the maximum I could possibly get which is all the items: 4 units of item 1 = 4*67=268, 4 units of item 2 = 4*81 = 324, 3 units of item 3= 3*70=210, 6 units of item 4= 6*49=294, 6 units of item 5 = 6*41=246. The total is 1342.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer (706) is greater than my outside offer (609), it is better to accept the current offer. I will not walk away and receive 609. It's not worth trying to get more by proposing a counteroffer since the discount factor will lower any potential gains.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This encourages early deals if the deal is good for both parties.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider various counteroffers and evaluate their value. Since I want to maximize my outcome, I should aim to secure as many of the higher value items as possible and as few of the low-value items. My current total value across all the items is 1320, my outside offer is 380, and I need to make an offer to the other player.\n    * It is not possible for me to secure a deal that gets me less than my outside option, as that is worse than walking away.\n\n    Let's consider an offer where I keep more of my high value items and less of the low value items, so I offer half of the lower value items, and a third of the higher value items: \n        *   Item 1: 3 to player 2, keeping 4 for myself\n        *   Item 2: 3 to player 2, keeping 3 for myself\n        *   Item 3: 2 to player 2, keeping 3 for myself\n        *   Item 4: 1 to player 2, keeping 3 for myself\n        *   Item 5: 1 to player 2, keeping 2 for myself\n        \n        My Value from keeping is: 4*8 + 3*43 + 3*66 + 3*97 + 2*96 = 32 + 129 + 198 + 291 + 192 = 842.\n        This is much higher than my outside offer, and could be a reasonable opening offer.\n\n    Let's also consider an offer where we split evenly, giving myself only \n     \n        *   Item 1:  3 to player 2, keeping 4 for myself (can't do halves of 7)\n        *   Item 2: 3 to player 2, keeping 3 for myself\n        *   Item 3: 2 to player 2, keeping 3 for myself\n        *   Item 4: 2 to player 2, keeping 2 for myself\n        *   Item 5: 1 to player 2, keeping 2 for myself\n\n        My Value from keeping:  4*8 + 3*43 + 3*66 + 2*97 + 2*96 =  32 + 129 + 198 + 194 + 192 = 745\n\n        I have to consider that the other player has a similar goal, and that they have their own private values, making a very even split not necessarily the best start. \n\n        Let's consider offering even less, offering 2 units of each item.\n\n        *   Item 1: 2 to player 2, keeping 5 for myself\n        *   Item 2: 2 to player 2, keeping 4 for myself\n        *   Item 3: 2 to player 2, keeping 3 for myself\n        *   Item 4: 2 to player 2, keeping 2 for myself\n        *   Item 5: 2 to player 2, keeping 1 for myself\n        \n         My Value from keeping: 5*8 + 4*43 + 3*66 + 2*97 + 1*96 = 40 + 172 + 198 + 194 + 96 = 700\n\n        A starting offer that I would make would be 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\n\n    *   **Comparison to outside offer:**  My outside offer is 380. My potential counter offer (based on the division above) gives me a value of 842.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI should not accept any offer since there are none.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 380\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 8, Item 2: 43, Item 3: 66, Item 4: 97, Item 5: 96\n*   **Total pool of items:** 7 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be applied once. So, the value of any deal accepted now would be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [2, 2, 1, 0, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 8 = 16\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 43 = 86\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 66 = 66\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 97 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 96 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 16 + 86 + 66 + 0 + 0 = 168\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 168 * 0.9 = 151.2\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (151.2) is significantly less than my outside offer (380).\n\n    Now, let's consider the previous offer and how it might be improved in a counteroffer.\n    Previous offer from Player 1: [3, 3, 2, 1, 1].\n    Let's calculate the value of that for myself.\n    I would keep: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n    4 * 8 = 32\n    3 * 43 = 129\n    3 * 66 = 198\n    3 * 97 = 291\n    2 * 96 = 192\n    Total: 842. With a discount of 0.9, this would be 757.8.\n    This is better than my outside offer, so I would prefer it.\n    The counteroffer [2,2,1,0,0] is bad.\n    It would be advantageous to offer something similar to what I offered previously.\n    Let's think about it this way: Player 2 offered me a really bad deal. I would prefer to keep a larger fraction of items I value. I can make a similar offer again, as there is still a round left, hoping they might accept. Let's try that.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is very bad, way below my outside offer value, so I should not accept it. My previous offer was good (if they had accepted it). So I will counteroffer by repeating my previous offer and hope they might accept.\nIt is better to get something now than nothing in the end, so I should not walk away.\n\nTherefore, I will make the same counteroffer that I made in the previous round.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 2, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Note that we want to maximize our utility, so we want to keep items for which our values are high:\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: I take it all.** This is my maximum potential offer - what if I offer the other player nothing?\n        * 6 units of item 1: 6 * 57 = 342\n        * 3 units of item 2: 3 * 98 = 294\n        * 3 units of item 3: 3 * 16 = 48\n        * 2 units of item 4: 2 * 4 = 8\n        * 3 units of item 5: 3 * 12 = 36\n        * Total value = 342 + 294 + 48 + 8 + 36 = 728\n        This is a possible maximal value, but would definitely be rejected by the other player.\n    *   **Scenario 2: Offer that values more than the outside offer.**\n         * If the other player took nothing of item 2 my offer would be 2 x 98 = 196.  Let's try to give the other player 1 unit of item 2, which would reduce my value by 98 (I'd keep two units), and offer the other player some low value item.\n         * Giving Player 1: 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5. This is [0, 1, 3, 2, 2] which leaves me with [6, 2, 0, 0, 1].\n             * My value: 6 * 57 + 2 * 98 + 0 * 16 + 0 * 4 + 1 * 12 = 342 + 196 + 12 = 550\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is 301, which is well above my outside offer of 176. \n*   I could make a counteroffer to try to get more. However, because this is round 1 I am willing to accept this offer as it already far exceeds my outside offer. The discount factor is 0.9, so next round my gain will be multiplied by 0.9 if I get a better offer (and reduced if I get a worse one), but that reduction might not be worth it.\n\nTherefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

This means that accepting an offer later will be worth less (discounted) to me. This makes me more willing to seek a deal in earlier rounds. However, given that this is round 1, the effect of the discount is 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to formulate a good initial offer. I want to maximize my value, but I also need to make it appealing enough for Player 2 not to walk away. I know that I can at least get my outside offer of 646.\n    Let's consider my total value:\n    (1 * 61) + (4 * 39) + (1 * 78) + (7 * 65) + (2 * 23) = 61 + 156 + 78 + 455 + 46 = 796.\n    If I give the other player nothing, I would get a value of 796.\n    If I give away half the items (rounded up for items with odd quantities) I get:\n    0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 1 of item 5 which has a value of 2*39 + 4*65 + 1*23 = 87+260+23=367\n    This means I'd have a value of 796-367=429 which is lower than my outside offer.\n    Let's propose something close to 1/3 of the items to them, rounded down for me:\n        *   Item 1: Offer 0 to them, keeping 1 unit (61 for me)\n        *   Item 2: Offer 1 to them, keeping 3 units (3*39 = 117 for me)\n        *   Item 3: Offer 0 to them, keeping 1 unit (78 for me)\n        *   Item 4: Offer 2 to them, keeping 5 units (5*65 = 325 for me)\n        *   Item 5: Offer 0 to them, keeping 2 units (2*23 = 46 for me)\n    Total value of this offer: 61 + 117 + 78 + 325 + 46 = 627.\n    This value is still lower than my outside offer. Let's try offering slightly less, closer to 1/4, or something that allows me to keep higher value items:\n        *   Item 1: Offer 0 to them, keeping 1 unit (61 for me)\n        *   Item 2: Offer 1 to them, keeping 3 units (3*39 = 117 for me)\n        *   Item 3: Offer 0 to them, keeping 1 unit (78 for me)\n        *   Item 4: Offer 1 to them, keeping 6 units (6*65 = 390 for me)\n        *   Item 5: Offer 0 to them, keeping 2 units (2*23 = 46 for me)\n    Total Value: 61+117+78+390+46=692.

The current offer is more valuable than the outside option, so I should try to get a deal. In general I want to offer as little as possible while keeping the other player barely above their outside option (which is currently unknown to me). It would be dangerous for me to offer too little as the other player might prefer their outside offer.\n    *   I can try to get an even better deal by making a counteroffer where I only offer player 2 a bit.\n    * Let's evaluate a counteroffer of [0, 1, 0, 1, 0].

I want to ensure that my offer to Player 2 still results in a total value higher than my outside offer of 303. \n\nTo do this I'll make a counteroffer which gives most of the lower-value items to Player 2 and keeps most of the higher-value items for myself. \n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nBased on the above analysis I will make a counteroffer:\n* Offer Player 2:\n    * 2 units of Item 1\n    * 1 unit of Item 2\n    * 2 units of Item 3\n    * 2 units of Item 4\n    * 1 unit of Item 5\n\nThis would leave me with:\n    * 0 units of Item 1\n    * 3 units of Item 2\n    * 2 units of Item 3\n    * 0 units of Item 4\n    * 2 units of Item 5\n\nThis would have a value of 0 * 10 + 3 * 93 + 2 * 55 + 0 * 3 + 2 * 67 = 0 + 279 + 110 + 0 + 134 = 523.\nSince 523 is more than 303 I will propose this deal.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 2, 1]}\n```\n",

This means that an offer accepted in round 1 has full value (0.9^0 = 1), while an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its raw value, and so on.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 2, 2, 1].  This means I receive:\n    *   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 75 = 150\n    *   1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 85 = 85\n    *   2 units of item 3 = 2 * 11 = 22\n    *   2 units of item 4 = 2 * 56 = 112\n    *   1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 22 = 22\n    *   Total value of current offer = 150 + 85 + 22 + 112 + 22 = 391\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 391, which is greater than my outside offer of 324.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    Since this is round 1, we should consider counteroffers if it makes sense. Our goal is to maximize our return, however, in round 1 we do not need to consider any potential discount factors since discount is relative to the value from the final round.\n\n     Let's calculate the value of the remaining units if we keep them all:\n\n    * 0 units of item 1 = 0\n    * 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 85 = 255\n    * 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 11 = 22\n    * 0 units of item 4 = 0\n    * 2 units of item 5 = 2 * 22 = 44\n    * Total value: 321\n    \n    If we get the first offer, it is worth 391. If we take all the remaining items it is worth 321. We can consider a counter offer that gives us all item 2's, which are highly valued.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that gives Player 1 only item 3 and item 5, then we receive:\n    * 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 75 = 150\n    * 4 units of item 2 = 4 * 85 = 340\n    * 0 units of item 3 = 0\n    * 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 56 = 112\n    * 0 units of item 5 = 0\n    * Total value of this counteroffer for me = 150 + 340 + 0 + 112 + 0= 602\n\n    This would make our offer [0,0,4,0,3].\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is 391, which is greater than my outside offer of 324. However, I believe I could get more value if I can get all item 2s, and by offering player 1 all items of types 3 and 5. Since we still have two rounds to negotiate it is unlikely that walking is optimal.\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer that gives the player 1 the item 3s and 5s, which are of low value to me, and gives me all of item 2, which is highly valued.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 0, 3]}\n```\n",

Since 0 < 324, and even taking into account the discount factor, the value of accepting this offer is 0 * 0.9 = 0.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's evaluate what the value of keeping all the items would be:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 75 = 150\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 85 = 340\n    *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 11 = 44\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 56 = 112\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 22 = 66\n    *   Total value: 150 + 340 + 44 + 112 + 66 = 712\n\n    If I keep all items, and this is the outcome, my total value discounted by the negotiation round is 712 * 0.9 = 640.8\n\n    Let's try a counteroffer that gives player 1 a reasonable value, while still exceeding my outside offer. I will offer player 1 [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    This would leave me with:\n     * 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 75 = 75\n     * 2 units of item 2: 2 * 85 = 170\n     * 2 units of item 3: 2 * 11 = 22\n     * 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 56 = 56\n     * 2 units of item 5: 2 * 22 = 44\n     * Total value for me: 75 + 170 + 22 + 56 + 44 = 367\n     * Discounted value = 367 * 0.9 = 330.3\n\n    330.3 is > 324\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    * Accepting the current offer (0) is worse than my outside offer (324).\n    * Keeping all the items (640.8) is greater than my outside offer.\n    *  The counteroffer above (330.3) is greater than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible, I should not ACCEPT.\n*   Walking away guarantees me 324, but my total value if I keep most items is much better at 330.3 and higher if I keep all the items (640.8), so I should not WALK.\n*   I will offer a counteroffer to player 1 of [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n\n**Final Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 289\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 27\n    *   Item 2: 95\n    *   Item 3: 85\n    *   Item 4: 77\n    *   Item 5: 41\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 3\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 4\n    *   Item 5: 8\n*   **Discount factor influence:** The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) reduces the value of outcomes in later rounds. Accepting an offer now (round 1) means no discount. Waiting for a later round means the value of the outcome will be multiplied by 0.9^(r-1), where r is the round number. Therefore accepting the current offer of 289 is better than a final outcome of 289 in round 3 multiplied by 0.9*0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit, so 1 * 27 = 27\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit, so 1 * 95 = 95\n    *   Item 3: 2 units, so 2 * 85 = 170\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit, so 1 * 77 = 77\n    *   Item 5: 2 units, so 2 * 41 = 82\n    *   Total value of current offer: 27 + 95 + 170 + 77 + 82 = 451\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** There are many counteroffers I could consider, but my strategy should be to ask for a bigger share of the items that I value more. Let me consider a simple scenario of an equal division: I get half of everything, rounded down, for items with an even number. So I would get [1, 1, 2, 2, 4]\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit, so 1 * 27 = 27\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit, so 1 * 95 = 95\n    *   Item 3: 2 unit, so 2 * 85 = 170\n    *   Item 4: 2 unit, so 2 * 77 = 154\n    *   Item 5: 4 unit, so 4 * 41 = 164\n     *  Total value of equal division: 27 + 95 + 170 + 154+ 164 = 610\n    \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer (451) is greater than my outside offer (289), so I shouldn't walk away just yet.\n    *   My equal division calculation gives 610. If I can get this, I would be happier.\n    \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 451, and my outside offer is worth 289. I should not walk away. I want more, and an equal division of items results in a value of 610 which is better than the current offer. I will make a counteroffer that offers player 1 [1, 1, 2, 2, 4] which keeps [2, 2, 3, 2, 4] for myself.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 2, 4]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 2, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 2, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 731\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 64\n    *   Item 2: 96\n    *   Item 3: 44\n    *   Item 4: 65\n    *   Item 5: 7\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 0\n    *   Item 2: 6\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 8\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the same deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value of a deal in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 3, 2, 1, 4]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 0 - 0 = 0\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 3 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 8 - 4 = 4\n    \n    My value if I accept the current offer:\n    *   Item 1: 0 * 64 = 0\n    *   Item 2: 3 * 96 = 288\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 44 = 88\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 65 = 130\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 7 = 28\n    *   Total Value = 0 + 288 + 88 + 130 + 28 = 534\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (534) is less than my outside offer (731).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that are at least worth more than 731 to me (ideally accounting for the discount factor). Since the current offer is lower, I should make a counteroffer if I think player 1 is likely to accept it, rather than walking away.  Let me calculate the value of a more generous counteroffer to myself and see if it is significantly better than my current offer. \nFor example, let's offer player 1 half of the items:\n        * Item 1: 0 / 2 = 0\n        * Item 2: 6 / 2 = 3\n        * Item 3: 4 / 2 = 2\n        * Item 4: 3 / 2 = 1.5 (round up to 2 for player 1)\n        * Item 5: 8 / 2 = 4\nThis would mean my share is [0, 3, 2, 1, 4] and my value would be 534, just like the current offer, so this is no better for me.\nTo get more than 731 I would want to offer less than 3 of item 2, less than 2 of item 3, less than 2 of item 4 and less than 4 of item 5. \nLet's try giving player 1 [0, 2, 1, 0, 0] and see what value that yields for me. This implies I keep [0, 4, 3, 3, 8]\n    *   Item 1: 0 * 64 = 0\n    *   Item 2: 4 * 96 = 384\n    *   Item 3: 3 * 44 = 132\n    *   Item 4: 3 * 65 = 195\n    *   Item 5: 8 * 7 = 56\n    *   Total Value = 0 + 384 + 132 + 195 + 56 = 767\nThis is better than my outside offer, so this is a suitable counteroffer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside option, and I can create a counteroffer that's better than my outside offer and doesn't appear too greedy, I will make that counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Since there are no units of item 5, I don't need to consider it. Let's consider an offer of giving player 2 half of the items and seeing what its worth to me. Note that since the number of items is not always even, I am going to give them the floor of half the items, or the floor of half the items and one less unit of a smaller valued item:\n\n    *   **Offer 1: Giving player 2 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 0 units of item 5.

I need to consider offers which allow me to retain more of the valuable items. I could for example offer Player 2 very little to begin with, like 0 units of all items. In that case my value would be 648. This is more than my outside offer. I need to balance my desire for a good deal, and the discount factor, with the chance the other player walks.

In round 1, the discount factor will be 0.9^(1-1) = 1. So there is no present value discount on round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 0, 0, 0].  This means they are offering me 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 2. The other player would then receive [3, 5, 3, 2, 0].\n    *   My value if I accept: (1 * 88) + (1 * 94) = 182.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I will calculate a potential counter offer where I get the majority of the items.\n    *   If I keep 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5 then: (3 * 88) + (5 * 94) + (3 * 83) + (2 * 96) + (0 * 40) = 264 + 470 + 249 + 192 + 0 = 1175.\n    *   If I keep 4 unit of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5 then: (4 * 88) + (6 * 94) + (3 * 83) + (2 * 96) + (0 * 40) = 352 + 564 + 249 + 192 = 1357.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Accepting the current offer (182) is significantly worse than my outside offer (1050).\n    *   My potential counter offer with items 3, 5, 3, 2, 0 for myself (1175) is better than my outside offer.\n    *   Keeping all items has a value of 1357.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is far below my outside offer value. It's also less than what I believe I can obtain by making a reasonable counteroffer. I will make a counteroffer.  I want a large share of the items but I don't want to make an offer which makes me look completely unreasonable, so I'll offer 1 unit of each of item 1 and 2 back.\n\nTherefore, I will propose a counteroffer where I keep 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5 and give the other player the rest. This will mean I offer 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5 to the other player.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This would mean I would receive [4, 4, 3, 2, 0] for a total value:\n        (4 * 88) + (4 * 94) + (3 * 83) + (2 * 96) + (0 * 40) = 352 + 376 + 249 + 192 + 0 = 1169\n        Adjusting for the discount rate would be 1169 * 0.9 = 1052.1. This offer of [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] might be too greedy for the other player to accept. I will consider a counteroffer that gives up a bit more of each item.\n    *  Let's consider offering Player 1 [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]. This would mean I would receive [3, 4, 2, 2, 0] for a total value:\n        (3 * 88) + (4 * 94) + (2 * 83) + (2 * 96) + (0 * 40) = 264 + 376 + 166 + 192 + 0 = 998\n        Adjusting for the discount rate would be 998 * 0.9 = 898.2. This offer is also not as good as my outside option. \n    * It appears that no amount of reasonable units will be better than my outside offer, so I should WALK.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer's value is 896.4, which is less than my outside offer value of 1050.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer has a present value of 896.4, which is significantly lower than my outside offer of 1050.\n*   I've evaluated some counteroffers and none seem to be better than my outside option.\n*   Therefore, I should walk away and secure my outside offer value.\n\n**Final Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

Since this is round 2, if a deal is made this round, the value will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 0].  This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 55 = 55\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 69 = 69\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 95 = 95\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 35 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 34 = 0\n    *   Total value: 55 + 69 + 95 = 219\n    *   Discounted value: 219 * 0.9 = 197.1\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (197.1) is significantly greater than my outside offer value (39).\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider some potential counteroffers. I will focus on counteroffers that would be more beneficial to me and also be higher than my outside offer. Let's see what keeping the majority would do for me.\n    *   I could keep [3, 2, 3, 1, 1] for myself, offering [2, 1, 1, 0, 1].\n         * This gives me: 3 * 55 + 2 * 69 + 3 * 95 + 1 * 35 + 1 * 34 = 165 + 138 + 285 + 35 + 34 = 657\n         * This is a good value but let's check a couple more to ensure we get an optimal value.\n     * I could keep [4, 3, 4, 1, 2] for myself, offering [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n          * This gives me: 4 * 55 + 3 * 69 + 4 * 95 + 1 * 35 + 2 * 34 = 220 + 207 + 380 + 35 + 68 = 910. \n        * This is a high value. I think I will go with this one.\n   * I could keep [5, 3, 4, 1, 2] for myself, offering [0,0,0,0,0] but this is the same as walking away with my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer, even discounted (197.1), is much better than my outside offer (39). \n*   However, I think I can get a better deal for myself. I will make a counteroffer where I keep almost everything and just give a little bit to player 2. Specifically, I will keep [4, 3, 4, 1, 2] and offer player 2 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 316\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 80, Item 2: 89, Item 3: 16, Item 4: 18, Item 5: 88\n*   **Total items:** 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means any deal we make now will be worth 90% of its actual value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  My value for this offer is (1 * 80) + (0 * 89) + (0 * 16) + (0 * 18) + (0 * 88) = 80. Taking the discount factor into account, the discounted value of this offer is 80 * 0.9 = 72\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I have 5 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 2 of item 5.\n    * Let's consider a counter offer where I try to get as much as possible and propose that Player 1 gets as little as possible, but still something more than their last offer. I could propose [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would get 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 2 of item 5. The value of this to me would be (3 * 80) + (3 * 89) + (4 * 16) + (1 * 18) + (2 * 88) = 240 + 267 + 64 + 18 + 176 = 765. The discounted value of this is 765 * 0.9 = 688.5.\n    * Let's consider a counter offer where we split the items evenly, giving Player 1 2 units of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3 and 1 of item 5.  My value for this would be: 3 units of item 1 + 2 units of item 2 + 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 1 of item 5. The value of this to me would be (3 * 80) + (2 * 89) + (2 * 16) + (1 * 18) + (1 * 88) = 240 + 178 + 32 + 18 + 88 = 556. The discounted value of this is 556 * 0.9 = 500.4.\n    * Lets consider another counteroffer, offering [0,0,0,0,0] to Player 1, This offer would result in 765 with the discount factor it becomes 765*0.9 = 688.5\n    * I could also offer a compromise, taking 2 of each item for myself and giving 3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 5 to Player 1. This would mean I receive 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 1 of item 5. The value of this to me is 2*80 + 2*89 + 2*16 + 18 + 88 = 160 + 178 + 32 + 18 + 88 = 476.  The discounted value of this is 476 * 0.9 = 428.4.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is 316. The discounted value of the current offer is 72, significantly lower. Of the counteroffers mentioned, 688.5 is the highest but could be considered unreasonable, and it is likely to be rejected by Player 1. The second and third counteroffers (500.4, and 688.5) would both be more beneficial to me than my outside offer. The compromise of 428.4 is also more beneficial to me than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nAccepting the current offer is not beneficial. Walking away will yield a value of 316, and all of the counteroffers proposed are preferable after discounting, so I would not walk. Proposing [2,0,0,0,0] has the best potential value for me, so it is my preferred choice.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 700.\n*   **Item values:** My private values per unit are:\n    *   Item 1: 28\n    *   Item 2: 64\n    *   Item 3: 46\n    *   Item 4: 60\n    *   Item 5: 81\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   2 units of item 1\n    *   4 units of item 2\n    *   4 units of item 3\n    *   3 units of item 4\n    *   3 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means that if the negotiation concludes in round 2, the values will be multiplied by 0.9, and in round 3 by 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table, which makes this round the most valuable for making an offer because the discount is not yet in play.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I am starting, I can consider a number of offers. I should aim for a distribution that exceeds my outside option of 700. I will try a distribution where I receive most of the items, since I have no other information about Player 2's preferences. A very greedy offer that leaves the other player with a low value would be giving away just 1 unit of each item, except item 1 since there are only 2 units available. So, I give away 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. The alternative greedy approach would be to give all of item 1 and only 1 unit of the other items. Since the discount factor is important, I will test and select the better value of these two greedy approaches.\n    *   **Offer 1: Give away 1 unit of items 2, 3, 4, and 5.** I keep:\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 28 = 56\n        *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 64 = 192\n        *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 46 = 138\n        *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 60 = 120\n        *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 81 = 162\n        *   Total value = 56 + 192 + 138 + 120 + 162 = 668.\n    *   **Offer 2: Give away all of item 1 and 1 unit of item 2, 3, 4, and 5.** I keep:\n        *   0 units of item 1: 0\n        *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 64 = 192\n        *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 46 = 138\n        *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 60 = 120\n        *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 81 = 162\n        *   Total value = 0 + 192 + 138 + 120 + 162 = 612\n    Comparing these, the first offer is better. Since the discount factor will apply in future rounds, and there is no current offer on the table, I will be more aggressive and try for a better deal for myself. I will try offering Player 2 one of each item except item 1, and see if they accept.\n        \n    I will start with offer 1, as it is the best of my two greedy offers.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** Offer 1 is below my outside offer value of 700. However, I should be aiming to achieve the best outcome by round 3. Because I make the first offer, I should make a strong first offer and hope to get it accepted in this round or in the next round. If we reach round 3, the final round, the discount factor will reduce all outcomes. Therefore, it is worth starting with this good-but-not-perfect offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will not accept because there is no current offer.\n*   I will not walk away at this point because the value of making a deal at this point in time is greatest, and I have a good offer ready to go.\n*   Therefore, I will make a counteroffer with the first offer detailed above, which involves giving the other player 1 unit of items 2, 3, 4, and 5. \n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

I will offer to split everything approximately in half, while giving slightly more of item 3 to myself, as that is where my highest value is.\n*   I will offer the other player [1,2,2,1,1]\n    * This means I keep:\n          * 1 of item 1: 1 * 30 = 30\n          * 2 of item 2: 2 * 35 = 70\n          * 2 of item 3: 2 * 96 = 192\n          * 2 of item 4: 2 * 24 = 48\n          * 2 of item 5: 2 * 37 = 74\n          * Total value = 414\n\nThis offer is below my outside offer value. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to the middle:\nI will offer the other player [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] this gives me a value of 192.

This is significantly less than my outside offer of 700.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    * Let's consider a counteroffer that gives player 2 minimal value.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 522\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 30, Item 2: 35, Item 3: 96, Item 4: 24, Item 5: 37\n*   **Total pool of items:** 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, any deal we make will be multiplied by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 1].  This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer is (0 * 30) + (0 * 35) + (0 * 96) + (0 * 24) + (1 * 37) = 37.\n    *   The discounted value of this offer is 37 * 0.9 = 33.3\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 33.3 is much less than my outside offer of 522. Accepting this offer would be a terrible decision.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to calculate how much value different offers would have. I need to keep in mind that this is round 2 and only one round remains after this one. If I make a counteroffer, it will essentially be my last chance to get a deal with the player. Also, if I decide to make a counteroffer now, my counteroffer can only give up items to the other player. If I decide to propose a counteroffer of [x1,x2,x3,x4,x5], the value to me of this offer would be:\n    (2-x1) * 30 + (4-x2) * 35 + (4-x3) * 96 + (3-x4) * 24 + (3-x5) * 37, which would have to be larger than 522/0.9 or 580. This is due to the discount factor.\n\n    Let's think of a counteroffer that would be good for me, lets try a division where I get all the item 3s, half the item 2s and 1, and some of item 5.\n    A good offer to me could be [1, 2, 0, 1, 1], which means I get 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, all of item 3, 2 of item 4, 2 of item 5, giving the other agent [1, 2, 4, 2, 2]. If I made a counter offer of [1,2,0,1,1] my value would be: (1 * 30) + (2 * 35) + (4 * 96) + (2 * 24) + (2 * 37) = 30 + 70 + 384 + 48 + 74 = 606. \n    The discounted value of this is 606 * 0.9 = 545.4. This is greater than the outside offer and should be pursued.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is unacceptable as it's worth much less than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away would give me a value of 522.\n*   A counteroffer of [1, 2, 0, 1, 1] would give me a discounted value of 545.4, which is more than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I am player 1 and making the first move, I will propose a counteroffer. I need to consider what would be beneficial for me. I want to keep the most valuable items for myself, but leave the other player enough to avoid a walk.\n\nLet me consider a few potential offers and their values to me:\n    *   **Offer 1: Player 2 gets (2, 0, 1, 0, 1)**\n        *   I keep (5, 1, 3, 2, 3)\n        *   Value to me: (5 * 45) + (1 * 75) + (3 * 98) + (2 * 15) + (3 * 45) = 225 + 75 + 294 + 30 + 135 = 759\n    *   **Offer 2: Player 2 gets (1, 0, 1, 0, 1)**\n        *   I keep (6, 1, 3, 2, 3)\n        *   Value to me: (6 * 45) + (1 * 75) + (3 * 98) + (2 * 15) + (3 * 45) = 270 + 75 + 294 + 30 + 135 = 804\n    *   **Offer 3: Player 2 gets (3, 0, 1, 0, 1)**\n        *   I keep (4, 1, 3, 2, 3)\n        *  Value to me: (4*45) + (1*75) + (3*98) + (2*15) + (3*45) = 180 + 75 + 294 + 30 + 135 = 714\n    *   **Offer 4: Player 2 gets (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)**\n        *    I keep (7,1,4,2,4)\n        *    Value to me: (7*45) + (1*75) + (4*98) + (2*15) + (4*45) = 315+75+392+30+180 = 992\n    \nOffer 4 would be the optimal for me if I could convince player 2 to take nothing. I doubt that. My most valuable items are item 3 and item 2, so if i keep all of those, that would be good. Lets consider offering player 2 one of the less valuable items:\n    *    **Offer 5: Player 2 gets (1,0,0,1,1)**\n        *    I keep (6,1,4,1,3)\n        *    Value to me: (6*45)+(1*75)+(4*98)+(1*15)+(3*45) = 270 + 75 + 392 + 15 + 135 = 887\n    \nOffer 5 seems like a reasonable starting point, and is well above my outside offer. I will choose this for my initial offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer to player 2, giving them 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\nMy reasoning is that this offer maximizes my utility relative to my alternative, and also leaves them with some value so as not to elicit a WALK.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 783. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 717 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 783\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 30\n    *   Item 2: 44\n    *   Item 3: 81\n    *   Item 4: 12\n    *   Item 5: 72\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 7\n    *   Item 2: 1\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 will be worth 0.9 times its value, and an offer accepted in round 3 will be worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This means they keep:\n    *   Item 1: 7 - 1 = 6\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 0 = 4\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n\n    My value if I accept the offer is:\n    (1 * 30) + (0 * 44) + (0 * 81) + (1 * 12) + (1 * 72) = 30 + 0 + 0 + 12 + 72 = 114\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since the total number of rounds is 3, and this is round 1, I could try to make a counteroffer. I must have at least a value greater than my outside offer at the end of this round, so the total value must be greater than 783 and the value now is equal to the total value as gamma^0 = 1.\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I try to get all of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 2 of item 5, leaving the remaining items to player 1. My counteroffer to player 1 would be [7, 1, 0, 0, 2]. My remaining items would be [0, 0, 4, 2, 2]. My value would be:\n        (0 * 30) + (0 * 44) + (4 * 81) + (0 * 12) + (2 * 72) = 0 + 0 + 324 + 0 + 144= 468\n        \n    I need to get a total value greater than 783. Let me try to get all of item 3, item 4 and item 5 as this gives me the highest value per item. My counteroffer to player 1 would be [7, 1, 0, 0, 0]. My remaining items would be [0, 0, 4, 2, 4]. My value would be:\n       (0 * 30) + (0 * 44) + (4 * 81) + (2 * 12) + (4 * 72) = 0 + 0 + 324 + 24 + 288 = 636\n\n    Let me try to offer player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then my total would be:\n     (7 * 30) + (1 * 44) + (4 * 81) + (2 * 12) + (4 * 72) = 210 + 44 + 324 + 24 + 288 = 890.\n\n    I need more than 783 so a counteroffer will be accepted if I ask for more than [7, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n     Let me offer player 1 a smaller offer, one that ensures I am at least above my outside offer. \n     Let's say I ask for [0, 0, 2, 0, 2], This gives me a total value of\n     (7 * 30) + (1 * 44) + (2 * 81) + (2 * 12) + (2 * 72) = 210 + 44 + 162 + 24 + 144 = 584\n      Let's say I ask for [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Then I would get the rest:\n     (7 * 30) + (1 * 44) + (3 * 81) + (2 * 12) + (4 * 72) = 210 + 44 + 243 + 24 + 288= 809\n\n    Let's offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] to player 1. This would give me a total value of 809.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   The current offer is 114, which is much less than my outside offer of 783.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is very bad for me, my value if I accept the offer is significantly lower than my outside offer.\n*   I could walk away and receive 783.\n*  I should definitely not accept this offer. I should propose a counteroffer where I get more valuable items. A counteroffer of [0,0,1,0,0] to player one will result in a total value to me of 809 which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 783. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 717 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 783\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 30\n    *   Item 2: 44\n    *   Item 3: 81\n    *   Item 4: 12\n    *   Item 5: 72\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 7 units\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means any deal made this round is worth 90% of its undiscounted value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 30 = 30\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 44 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 81 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 12 = 12\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 72 = 72\n    *   Total value before discount: 30 + 0 + 0 + 12 + 72 = 114\n    *   Discounted value: 114 * 0.9 = 102.6\n    \n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   If I counteroffer in round 2, this would be treated as a walk in the last round. The best outcome would be to receive everything (or as close to that as possible).\n    *   If I offer player 1 0 of everything, then I would receive all the items:\n         *   7 units of item 1 = 7 * 30 = 210\n         *   1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 44 = 44\n         *   4 units of item 3 = 4 * 81 = 324\n         *   2 units of item 4 = 2 * 12 = 24\n         *   4 units of item 5 = 4 * 72 = 288\n         *   Total value = 210 + 44 + 324 + 24 + 288 = 890. Discounted value is then 890*0.9 = 801 which is more than 783\n         \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Accepting the current offer yields a discounted value of 102.6, which is much less than my outside offer of 783.\n    *   If I choose a counteroffer in this round, it will be a walk and I'll get my outside offer of 783.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is not optimal, as it is far below my outside offer value.\n*   Making a counteroffer will lead to a walk, with a value of 783.\n*   Walking away will also give me 783.\n\nSince the best I can do is 783 either through walking or a counter offer I will choose to walk and get my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1261. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Values of the items:**\n    *   Item 1: 66 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 20 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 91 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 9 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 20 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   5 units of Item 1\n    *   10 units of Item 2\n    *   8 units of Item 3\n    *   5 units of Item 4\n    *   4 units of Item 5\n*   **Discount factor influence:** The discount factor, gamma = 0.9, means that any deal agreed to in a later round is worth less to me in the present. Specifically, a deal in round 2 will have 0.9 times the value, and a deal in round 3 will have 0.9^2 = 0.81 times the value, compared to a deal in round 1. This gives me an incentive to achieve a good outcome early.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I am player 1 and it's the first round, I must make an offer. I should aim for a division of items that will give me a value above my outside option of 1261. I must also make sure it is a valid offer. My total value for all the items is 5*66+10*20+8*91+5*9+4*20=330+200+728+45+80=1383.\nLet's consider giving the other player the same amount of each type of item except for the least valuable ones. This is likely a good opening offer. I could offer Player 2 2 of each of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 2 of item 5. This would leave me with 3 of item 1, 8 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5. Let's evaluate the value:\n     * 3 * 66 = 198\n     * 8 * 20 = 160\n     * 6 * 91 = 546\n     * 3 * 9 = 27\n     * 2 * 20 = 40\n     Total value for me: 198+160+546+27+40=971. 971 is smaller than my outside offer, so this offer is too generous.\nLet's try offering Player 2 less valuable items and leaving me the more valuable ones. I could offer player 2 0 items of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 2 of item 5. This would leave me with 5 of item 1, 8 of item 2, 7 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n  * 5 * 66 = 330\n  * 8 * 20 = 160\n  * 7 * 91 = 637\n  * 3 * 9 = 27\n  * 2 * 20 = 40\n  Total value for me: 330+160+637+27+40=1194. This is still less than my outside offer.\nLet's try offering Player 2 0 items of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. This would leave me with 5 of item 1, 9 of item 2, 7 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 4 of item 5. Let's evaluate the value:\n     * 5 * 66 = 330\n     * 9 * 20 = 180\n     * 7 * 91 = 637\n     * 5 * 9 = 45\n     * 4 * 20 = 80\n     Total value for me: 330+180+637+45+80 = 1272. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is 1261. The counteroffer I described above would give me 1272.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI should not accept the current offer, as there is no current offer on the table. Walking away will only give me 1261. The counteroffer above gives me more than my outside offer, and as round 1, is a good place to start.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

Therefore, I should reject this offer.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    *   I need to ensure I get at least 859 from any deal at this round. Since this round is 1, there is no discount to consider yet.\n\n    *   To determine a useful counteroffer, I need to calculate how much value I retain if I offer certain units of the items to Player 1.\n    *   If I offer player 1 [0,0,0,0,0] I keep: 5 * 12 + 10 * 54 + 8 * 37 + 5 * 85 + 4 * 43 = 60 + 540 + 296 + 425 + 172 = 1493\n    *   If I offer player 1 [0,1,1,0,0] I keep : 1493 - 91 = 1402\n    *   Let's try to calculate the minimum amounts I must keep, assuming player 1 will give me the rest. I want to receive a deal value of at least 859:\n    *   To start, I will try to obtain all the units from item 4 which has the highest per unit value. So I will demand to keep all 5 units, which amounts to 5*85 = 425.\n    *   Next, I'll try to keep all of item 2. That would be 10*54= 540 and together 425+540=965. Since 965 > 859, this may work, I should keep at least the items 2 and 4.\n\n    Let's propose a counteroffer where I keep all of items 2 and 4 and divide the remaining items: I would offer player 1 [3, 3, 4, 0, 2]  (i.e. I keep 2 of item 1, 7 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 2 of item 5) for myself. In this case I keep:\n    2*12 + 7*54 + 4*37 + 5*85 + 2*43 = 24+378+148+425+86=1063 which is > 859. This is a valid offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0, 1, 1, 0, 0] is unacceptable as my value is 91, far below my outside offer of 859.\n*   I should not walk away right now as it is round 1 and I can still try to negotiate a better deal.\n*   I will propose the counteroffer [3, 3, 4, 0, 2], which should still give me a good return.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 4, 0, 2]}\n```\n",

This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 60 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 80 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 50 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 43 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 92 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 8 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that if a deal is reached in round 2, its value will be multiplied by 0.9, and in round 3 by 0.81 (0.9^2). This means offers in later rounds must be more valuable to be as good as a deal in earlier rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I am Player 1 and it is the first round, I need to propose an initial offer. My goal is to maximize my value, but I also need to propose something reasonable to ensure the other player doesn't walk away in later rounds. If I ask for too much, the other player might not accept, and if I ask for too little I might get less than my outside offer.\n*   **Comparing to outside offer:** Any deal I accept must be worth more than 625 for me to not walk away.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I have to make the first offer. A good initial strategy might be to propose something that gives me a good portion of the total item value, while leaving enough for Player 2 to see a benefit in accepting.\n\nMy total value if I keep all items is:\n(2 * 60) + (8 * 80) + (5 * 50) + (1 * 43) + (1 * 92) = 120 + 640 + 250 + 43 + 92 = 1145.\nI should keep the items I value most (e.g. item 5, item 2, item 1) and give the items I value less to the opponent.\n\nLet's propose giving Player 2:\n*   Item 1: 0 units\n*   Item 2: 3 units\n*   Item 3: 3 units\n*   Item 4: 1 unit\n*   Item 5: 0 units\n\nThis means I keep:\n*   Item 1: 2 units\n*   Item 2: 5 units\n*   Item 3: 2 units\n*   Item 4: 0 unit\n*   Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThe value of this proposed deal to me is:\n(2 * 60) + (5 * 80) + (2 * 50) + (0 * 43) + (1 * 92) = 120 + 400 + 100 + 0 + 92 = 712.\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 625.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will make the above counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 3, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 3, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 4, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we are in round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer value:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 4, 2, 0, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 60 = 60\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 80 = 320\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 50 = 100\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 43 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 92 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer = 60 + 320 + 100 + 0 + 0 = 480.\n    *   Discounted value of current offer = 480 * 0.9 = 432\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to compare counter offers to the outside offer after applying discount, and also find an offer that gives me more value than what I am being offered. The total value of all items is 2 * 60 + 8 * 80 + 5 * 50 + 1 * 43 + 1 * 92 = 120 + 640 + 250 + 43 + 92 = 1145. The discounted value of the outside offer is 625. Since I have a strong preference for item 5, I will propose an offer that gives me a larger share of item 5, but is still reasonable in terms of total value.\n    * Lets try offering them [0, 5, 2, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This results in:\n        *   2 * 60 + 3 * 80 + 3 * 50 + 1 * 43 + 1 * 92 = 120 + 240 + 150 + 43 + 92 = 645\n    *   Discounted value of this counteroffer = 645 * 0.9 = 580.5. This is less than the outside offer value so we need to try a different split.\n    * Let's try offering them [0, 4, 1, 0, 0] which means I get [2, 4, 4, 1, 1].\n        * 2 * 60 + 4 * 80 + 4 * 50 + 1 * 43 + 1 * 92 = 120 + 320 + 200 + 43 + 92 = 775\n    *   Discounted value of this counteroffer = 775 * 0.9 = 697.5 which is greater than our outside offer of 625, so this is a better offer.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Discounted value of the current offer (432) is much lower than my outside offer value (625).\n    *   Discounted value of our counteroffer (697.5) is higher than the outside offer value (625).\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is not good for me, as it gives me a value of 432, less than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away would get me 625.\n*   A reasonable counteroffer of [0, 4, 1, 0, 0] would get me a discounted value of 697.5, which is better than walking away, and the counteroffer I just made gives me more than the current offer.\n*   Therefore, I should make this counteroffer.\n\n**Final Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 416\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 7\n    *   Item 2: 27\n    *   Item 3: 53\n    *   Item 4: 46\n    *   Item 5: 8\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 8 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal made in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value, and in round 3 is worth 0.81 (0.9 * 0.9) times the value. This means that there is a small incentive to agree sooner rather than later, but it's not a large factor after a single round.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  Since I am making the first move, I need to consider what might be a good starting offer. The overall value of the items to me is:\n    (4 * 7) + (5 * 27) + (8 * 53) + (2 * 46) + (4 * 8) = 28 + 135 + 424 + 92 + 32 = 711\n\nI want to propose an offer that is better than my outside offer while also being something Player 2 is likely to agree to. As a first offer, I want to be somewhat generous. Let's start with something that gives them a larger share than me.  If I give Player 2 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5, then I would be left with 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.  My value for this allocation would be:\n\n(2 * 7) + (2 * 27) + (3 * 53) + (1 * 46) + (2 * 8) = 14 + 54 + 159 + 46 + 16 = 289. This is not better than my outside offer.\n\nIf I offer them 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5, then I would have 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.  My value for this allocation would be:\n\n(3 * 7) + (3 * 27) + (4 * 53) + (2 * 46) + (2 * 8) = 21 + 81 + 212 + 92 + 16 = 422. This is greater than my outside offer. This is a good starting position, and a reasonable counteroffer if they made a bad initial offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n*   I will propose the offer that gives Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5. This gives me a value of 422.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 4, 0, 2]}\n```\n",

This means that the value of an outcome in round *r* is reduced by 0.9<sup>(r-1)</sup>. Since it's round 1, this factor is currently 0.9<sup>(1-1)</sup> = 0.9<sup>0</sup> = 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 has offered me [1, 2, 4, 0, 2].

Let's calculate the total value to me:\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 55 = 55\n    *   Item 2: 2 * 94 = 188\n    *   Item 3: 4 * 35 = 140\n    *   Item 4: 0 * 83 = 0\n    *   Item 5: 2 * 90 = 180\n    *   Total value: 55 + 188 + 140 + 0 + 180 = 563\n\n    Since the discount factor in round 1 is 1, the discounted value of accepting the current offer is also 563.\n\n    This value is less than my outside option of 690.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** To make a good counteroffer, I need to consider keeping more of the high-value items (2, 4, and 5), and giving away more of the low value item 3. I can also think about items I get only a small amount of like item 1. Let's consider keeping 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. This would mean giving the other player 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   * Item 1: 3 * 55 = 165\n   * Item 2: 4 * 94 = 376\n   * Item 3: 4 * 35 = 140\n   * Item 4: 1 * 83 = 83\n   * Item 5: 3 * 90 = 270\n   * Total value = 1034\n     This is a very good value for me, much higher than my outside offer. Let's calculate another counteroffer that's a bit less greedy but still higher than my outside offer. Let's propose that I keep 2 of Item 1, 3 of Item 2, 5 of Item 3, 1 of Item 4, and 2 of Item 5, which means I offer 2 of Item 1, 2 of Item 2, 3 of Item 3, 1 of Item 4, 2 of Item 5 to Player 1.\n    * Item 1: 2 * 55 = 110\n    * Item 2: 3 * 94 = 282\n    * Item 3: 5 * 35 = 175\n    * Item 4: 1 * 83 = 83\n    * Item 5: 2 * 90 = 180\n    * Total value = 830\n\n    This offer is lower than the previous one, but still higher than my outside option.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of 563 is less than my outside offer of 690. Therefore, I should not accept.\n*   I have calculated a number of counteroffers, and have picked a good one (the latter of the two calculated above), that is better than my outside option.\n\nTherefore, I should propose the counteroffer which gives player 1  [2, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 3, 1, 2]}\n```\n",

I'll consider a counteroffer where I propose a split closer to the ideal for me. Since I value item 3 highly, and Player 2's last offer was to keep 3, I will try to get 6 of them. I'll also aim to get 3 of item 2. Item 1 doesn't matter much, so I'll give them 2. For item 4 and item 5, I want them as well so I will offer them the minimum.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 690\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 55\n    *   Item 2: 94\n    *   Item 3: 35\n    *   Item 4: 83\n    *   Item 5: 90\n*   **Total items:** 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9 for any deal we make now.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 2, 2, 0, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 55 = 110\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 94 = 188\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 35 = 70\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 83 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 90 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 110 + 188 + 70 + 0 + 0 = 368.\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 368 * 0.9 = 331.2\n\n*   **Previous round's counteroffer from me:** [2, 2, 3, 1, 2] meant that player 1 had:\n    * 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n\n* **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider offering Player 1 a division which is worse than the previous offer that Player 1 gave me, to see what happens in the final round. Player 1 offered [2,2,2,0,0] and I counter offered [2,2,3,1,2] which was worse for player 1 as it included item 4 and 5 (which are both valuable items). This time I will propose to make Player 1's situation better, and offer them more of the items I don't value highly, in the hopes that they will accept.\n    * To calculate my value, I will first calculate what I keep.\n    * If I offer [1,3,7,1,2] to player 1, then I keep 3 item 1, 2 item 2, 1 item 3, 1 item 4, 2 item 5\n    * My value would be 3*55 + 2*94 + 1*35 + 1*83 + 2*90 = 165 + 188 + 35 + 83 + 180 = 651.\n    * Discounted value 651 * 0.9 = 585.9.\n\n    * If I offer [0,1,6,0,0] to Player 1, then I keep 4 item 1, 4 item 2, 2 item 3, 2 item 4, 4 item 5\n    * My value is 4*55 + 4*94 + 2*35 + 2*83 + 4*90 = 220 + 376 + 70 + 166 + 360 = 1192\n    * Discounted value 1192 * 0.9 = 1072.8\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer has a discounted value of 331.2, which is less than my outside offer of 690. My potential counteroffers yield 585.9 and 1072.8 when discounted.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is not good enough, as it is lower than my outside offer. Offering [1,3,7,1,2] is also not good enough, as its value is lower than my outside offer. However, offering [0,1,6,0,0] gives me a discounted value of 1072.8, which is better than my outside offer value of 690. I will therefore make this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 6, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1008\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 7\n    *   Item 2: 23\n    *   Item 3: 44\n    *   Item 4: 100\n    *   Item 5: 53\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2\n    *   Item 2: 5\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 6\n    *   Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since we are in round 1, the discount factor doesn't apply yet, but it will if the game proceeds to later rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    Since I am the first player, I must make a counteroffer or walk away. Let's think strategically. I want an offer that will be good for me but will also encourage the other player to accept. I should try to claim the most valuable items for myself. Let's calculate the total value if I take all of each type of item:\n        *   Item 1 (2 units): 2 * 7 = 14\n        *   Item 2 (5 units): 5 * 23 = 115\n        *   Item 3 (5 units): 5 * 44 = 220\n        *   Item 4 (6 units): 6 * 100 = 600\n        *   Item 5 (2 units): 2 * 53 = 106\n        *   Total value: 14 + 115 + 220 + 600 + 106 = 1055\n    This matches the total value I calculated earlier. This is the maximum value. Now I need to figure out what is a reasonable offer. An equal split wouldn't be ideal. I should attempt to obtain the majority of item 4, since it's my most valuable item. An offer where I take most of item 4, and give away other items is likely to result in a good outcome for me. For example, I could offer 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.

I should aim higher. I could try offering 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. Then I'd get:\n        *   Item 1 (2 units): 2 * 7 = 14\n        *   Item 2 (4 units): 4 * 23 = 92\n        *   Item 3 (4 units): 4 * 44 = 176\n        *   Item 4 (4 units): 4 * 100 = 400\n        *   Item 5 (2 units): 2 * 53 = 106\n        *   Total value: 14 + 92 + 176 + 400 + 106 = 788.\n    Still below my outside offer. How about I offer 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 1 of item 5. Then I would get\n        * Item 1 (1 unit): 1 * 7 = 7\n        * Item 2 (3 units): 3 * 23 = 69\n        * Item 3 (3 units): 3 * 44 = 132\n        * Item 4 (6 units): 6 * 100 = 600\n        * Item 5 (1 unit): 1 * 53 = 53\n        * Total value: 7 + 69 + 132 + 600 + 53 = 861\n    Still below.

I am going to make an offer to give 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 0 of item 5.\nIf I get all the other items, I have value:\n14 + 92 + 176 + 600 + 106 = 988\nI want to get above my outside value, I cannot in the first round.\nI will offer 0,1,1,0,0 to the other player.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

For round 1, this is 0.9^(1-1)=1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 76) + (1 * 13) + (1 * 44) + (0 * 41) + (0 * 67) = 13 + 44 = 57\n    *   Since 57 < 339, accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to think about what I could offer Player 1 while still exceeding my outside offer. I need to keep enough for myself so that my value of the items I keep exceeds 339. Let me consider an offer of [1, 2, 2, 3, 1] to Player 1. This means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\n    *   My value from this is: (1 * 76) + (3 * 13) + (3 * 44) + (3 * 41) + (1 * 67) = 76 + 39 + 132 + 123 + 67 = 437\n    *   Since 437 is higher than my outside option, this seems reasonable\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is not good as it provides value 57 while I have an outside option of 339.\n*   Walking away at this point is an option but it's better to aim for a better outcome.\n*   Proposing a counteroffer seems best. I'll offer Player 1 [1, 2, 2, 3, 1], which gives me a value of 437 which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 339.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]}\n```\n",

Let's calculate the value of a few potential counteroffers. First I need to calculate the total value I have.\n    * My total value: (2 * 7) + (5 * 23) + (5 * 44) + (6 * 100) + (2 * 53) = 14 + 115 + 220 + 600 + 106 = 1055.\n\n    Let's consider offering the other player half of the items rounding up. This would be a counteroffer of [1,3,3,3,1]\n    * My value if I give player 2 [1,3,3,3,1] is (1 * 7) + (2 * 23) + (2 * 44) + (3 * 100) + (1 * 53) = 7 + 46 + 88 + 300 + 53 = 494\n    * Discounted value: 494 * 0.9 = 444.6\n    * Let's consider offering [0, 2, 2, 2, 0]: My value is (2 * 7) + (3 * 23) + (3 * 44) + (4 * 100) + (2 * 53) = 14 + 69 + 132 + 400 + 106 = 721\n    * Discounted value = 721 * 0.9 = 648.9\n\n    Let's consider offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n     * My value: 1055\n     * Discounted value 949.5\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    * Accepting the current offer gives me 444.6, which is less than my outside offer of 1008.\n    * My value if I offer [1,3,3,3,1] is 444.6 which is less than my outside offer of 1008.\n    * My value if I offer [0, 2, 2, 2, 0] is 648.9 which is less than my outside offer of 1008.\n    * My value if I offer [0,0,0,0,0] is 949.5, less than my outside offer of 1008.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nSince the discounted value of accepting the current offer (444.6) and all other offers are below my outside offer (1008), I should walk away.

As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 120\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 77\n    *   Item 2: 54\n    *   Item 3: 91\n    *   Item 4: 49\n    *   Item 5: 18\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 9 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that if a deal is reached in round 2, its value is multiplied by 0.9, and if reached in round 3 by 0.9^2 = 0.81. The discount factor makes it preferable to reach a deal sooner rather than later, but a large enough deal to offset the discount may be worth waiting for.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so this is irrelevant.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I'm making the first offer, I need to decide what to propose to the other player. I want to maximize my value, but I also need to offer enough to make it worthwhile for the other player to accept, or I will get my outside offer of 120.\n    *   **Option 1: A very generous offer.** I could offer half the items to the other player. This may be the most likely offer to be accepted in round 1, and given there is only a small discount this is a good strategy for early rounds. I'll need to round this up to be integers. This means offering:\n            *   Item 1: 2 units (keeping 3)\n            *   Item 2: 5 units (keeping 4)\n            *   Item 3: 2 units (keeping 1)\n            *   Item 4: 1 units (keeping 1)\n            *   Item 5: 1 units (keeping 0)\n        My value would then be:\n            *   3 * 77 = 231\n            *   4 * 54 = 216\n            *   1 * 91 = 91\n            *   1 * 49 = 49\n            *   0 * 18 = 0\n        Total: 231+216+91+49+0= 587. This is far greater than my outside offer of 120.\n    *   **Option 2: Offer slightly more than half of each item to them.** I'll need to round this up to be integers. This means offering:\n        *   Item 1: 3 units (keeping 2)\n        *   Item 2: 6 units (keeping 3)\n        *   Item 3: 2 units (keeping 1)\n        *   Item 4: 2 units (keeping 0)\n        *   Item 5: 1 units (keeping 0)\n        My value would then be:\n            *   2 * 77 = 154\n            *   3 * 54 = 162\n            *   1 * 91 = 91\n            *   0 * 49 = 0\n            *   0 * 18 = 0\n        Total: 154 + 162 + 91 = 407. This is much greater than my outside offer of 120.\n    *   **Option 3: A less generous offer, I will offer just below half.**\n         *  Item 1: 2 units (keeping 3)\n         *  Item 2: 4 units (keeping 5)\n         *  Item 3: 1 units (keeping 2)\n         *  Item 4: 1 units (keeping 1)\n         *  Item 5: 0 units (keeping 1)\n        My value would then be:\n           *   3 * 77 = 231\n           *   5 * 54 = 270\n           *   2 * 91 = 182\n           *   1 * 49 = 49\n           *   1 * 18 = 18\n         Total: 750. This is much greater than my outside offer of 120.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI need to decide whether to walk away, make an offer or accept an offer (none available here). As there is no current offer I will make a counteroffer. I will propose option 3, as this will leave me with the most value while still being reasonable. This will give the other player enough value, while still giving me more, and it is better than my outside option.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 5 units of item 1, 9 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 99 for item 1, 88 for item 2, 41 for item 3, 54 for item 4, 94 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1612. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 216. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 216. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1128 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 216\n*   **Values of the items (per unit):**\n    *   Item 1: 99\n    *   Item 2: 88\n    *   Item 3: 41\n    *   Item 4: 54\n    *   Item 5: 94\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 9 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal made in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of a deal made in round 1, and a deal made in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times the value of a deal made in round 1. This incentivizes us to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 4, 1, 1, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 0 units\n    My value for this offer is: (2 * 99) + (4 * 88) + (1 * 41) + (1 * 54) + (0 * 94) = 198 + 352 + 41 + 54 + 0 = 645.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (645) is significantly greater than my outside offer (216).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** It's useful to consider what a counteroffer *could* look like, but it's not necessary to calculate everything at this point. Since the current offer is substantially above my outside offer I should prefer it over walking away. Some options would be to try to take more items from Player 1 if I thought I could reasonably do so.\n    For example, I could consider counter offering [1, 3, 0, 0, 0] which would give me (4 * 99) + (6*88) + (3*41) + (2*54) + (1*94) = 396 + 528+ 123 + 108 + 94 = 1249. Player 1's portion would be (1*99) + (3 * 88) + (0 * 41) + (0 * 54) + (0 * 94) = 363.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 645 to me, which is much greater than my outside offer of 216.\n*   Since this is the first round, I could propose a counteroffer, trying to get a better deal. However, the current offer is already quite favorable so I don't need to risk walking away and losing it.\n\nGiven that the current offer is already very good, and the discount factor penalizes delaying a deal, I should accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",
