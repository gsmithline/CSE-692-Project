You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n",
      "    Let's walk through this step by step:\n",
      "\n",
      "    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n",
      "       - What is my outside offer value?\n",
      "       - What are the values of the items involved?\n",
      "       - What is the total pool of items?\n",
      "       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n",
      "\n",
      "    2) Assess the value of offers:\n",
      "       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n",
      "       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n",
      "       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n",
      "\n",
      "    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n",
      "       - Should I accept the current offer?\n",
      "       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n",
      "       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n",
      "\n",
      "    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n",
      "    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n",
      "    These mistakes are:\n",
      "    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n",
      "    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n",
      "    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n",
      "    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n",
      "    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n",
      "\n",
      "    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n",
      "    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 3, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n",
      "    34 x 1 + 86 x 0 + 57 x 3 + 1 x 1 + 6 x 0\n",
      "    which is 206 (sum of all item values) \n",
      "    \n",
      "    which is less than your outside offer of 207. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n",
      "    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n",

A starting point is to retain most of the items for which I have a high value and offer a small amount of the other items to Player 2. A valid offer has to be a valid division of the number of units available for each item.\\n\\n    Let's first calculate the value if I kept all the items myself:\\n    10 * 34 + 2 * 86 + 4 * 57 + 5 * 1 + 0 * 6 = 340 + 172 + 228 + 5 + 0 = 745\\n\\n    Since my outside offer is 207, it seems that keeping everything gives me a much higher value, so I will begin making offers and checking the value that I get for each.\\n    \\n    I need to make a valid counteroffer so I must offer a non-zero amount to Player 2.\\n\\n    Let's try offering Player 2: [3,1,1,1,0].\\n    Then I would keep [7,1,3,4,0].\\n    My value would be: 7*34 + 1*86 + 3*57 + 4*1 + 0*6 = 238 + 86 + 171 + 4 + 0 = 499.\\n\\n    This seems good, as it's better than my outside offer.\\n\\n    Let's see what happens if I offer [4,2,2,2,0] to Player 2. This would mean keeping [6,0,2,3,0].\\n    My value would be: 6*34 + 0*86 + 2*57 + 3*1 + 0*6 = 204 + 0 + 114 + 3 + 0 = 321.\\n    This is also good. Let's see what would happen if I offer more.\\n\\n    Let's try offering [5,1,2,3,0]. This would mean I would keep [5,1,2,2,0].\\n    My value is 5*34 + 1*86 + 2*57 + 2*1 + 0*6 = 170 + 86 + 114 + 2 + 0 = 372.\\n    This is also okay, but lower than my previous offer.\\n\\n    Let's offer [3,1,1,1,0] to player 2. This means that I would keep [7,1,3,4,0]\\n    My value would be 7*34 + 1*86 + 3*57 + 4*1 + 0*6 = 238 + 86 + 171 + 4 + 0 = 499. This seems like a reasonable first offer.\\n    \\n**3) Make a decision:**\\n\\nBased on my analysis, I should make a counteroffer.

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less.

Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\\n\\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine a counteroffer that is better for me than my outside offer after discounting. I will construct my counteroffer to take as many of the valuable items as possible and maximize my value.\\n\\n    *   My total item values are 38 * 10 + 6 * 2 + 25 * 4 + 30 * 5 + 99 * 0 = 380 + 12 + 100 + 150 + 0 = 642.\\n    *   Let's start by keeping all of item 5, since it is the most valuable, but there are 0 of these to keep.

Therefore, accepting the offer is better than walking away right now.\\n\\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\\nSince the current offer is better than my outside offer, and it is already round 2, it is best to accept it.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"ACCEPT\\\"}\\n```\\n\"\n",

      "    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n",
      "    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n",
      "    These mistakes are:\n",
      "    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n",
      "    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n",
      "    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n",
      "    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n",
      "    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n",
      "\n",
      "    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n",
      "    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n",
      "    12 x 0 + 22 x 2 + 99 x 3 + 8 x 0 + 24 x 0\n",
      "    which is 341 (sum of all item values) \n",
      "    \n",
      "    which is less than your outside offer of 342. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n",

My total possible value is:\\n    (2 * 12) + (7 * 22) + (3 * 99) + (3 * 8) + (6 * 24) = 24 + 154 + 297 + 24 + 144 = 643\\n\\n    I want to make an offer that is good for me but also reasonable enough that Player 2 might consider accepting it, rather than walking away. I will try to maximize my value while not offering everything. Offering nothing would be a mistake in the first round.\\n    Let me assess a few potential offers:\\n\\n    *   **Offer 1:**  Give Player 2 half of everything, rounding down when necessary. So: [1, 3, 1, 1, 3]. This would mean keeping [1, 4, 2, 2, 3] for myself. Value = (1 * 12) + (4 * 22) + (2 * 99) + (2 * 8) + (3 * 24) = 12 + 88 + 198 + 16 + 72 = 386. This is greater than my outside offer.\\n   *    **Offer 2:** Be more aggressive. I'll try to keep most of my higher value items. Keep [2, 5, 3, 2, 4]. Offer [0, 2, 0, 1, 2].\\n     Value = (2 * 12) + (5 * 22) + (3 * 99) + (2 * 8) + (4 * 24) = 24 + 110 + 297 + 16 + 96 = 543. This is much greater than my outside offer.\\n     *   **Offer 3:** Be slightly less aggressive. Keep [2, 4, 2, 2, 3]. Offer [0, 3, 1, 1, 3]. Value = (2 * 12) + (4 * 22) + (2 * 99) + (2 * 8) + (3 * 24) = 24 + 88 + 198 + 16 + 72 = 398. This is still greater than my outside offer.\\n\\n    Offer 2 seems good since it maximizes my value, though I will choose a slightly less aggressive offer in the first round to be sure. Offer 3 looks like a good first round offer.\\n\\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\\n\\n*   I should not accept the current offer since there is no current offer.\\n*   I should not walk away since my outside offer is lower than what I can potentially get if I negotiate a good deal.\\n*   I should propose counteroffer [0, 3, 1, 1, 3], as that is a good initial offer that gives me a value of 398, which is greater than my outside offer of 342.\\n\\n**Action:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 3, 1, 1, 3]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

      "    Let's walk through this step by step:\n",
      "\n",
      "    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n",
      "       - What is my outside offer value?\n",
      "       - What are the values of the items involved?\n",
      "       - What is the total pool of items?\n",
      "       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n",
      "\n",
      "    2) Assess the value of offers:\n",
      "       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n",
      "       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n",
      "       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n",
      "\n",
      "    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n",
      "       - Should I accept the current offer?\n",
      "       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n",
      "       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n",
      "\n",
      "    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n",
      "    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n",
      "    These mistakes are:\n",
      "    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n",
      "    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n",
      "    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n",
      "    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n",
      "    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n",
      "\n",
      "    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n",
      "    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 3, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n",
      "    7 x 0 + 77 x 5 + 58 x 3 + 55 x 3 + 22 x 2\n",
      "    which is 768 (sum of all item values) \n",
      "    \n",
      "    which is less than your outside offer of 769. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n",
      "    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n",

This means that an agreement in round 2 is worth 0.9 times what it would be in round 1, and in round 3 it would be worth 0.81 times what it would be in round 1.\\n\\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\\n\\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep all items: [2, 7, 3, 3, 6]. My value for this is (2 * 7) + (7 * 77) + (3 * 58) + (3 * 55) + (6 * 22) = 14 + 539 + 174 + 165 + 132 = 1024.\\n*   **Counteroffers:** I need to think about reasonable counteroffers that are better than my outside offer. My total value without any discount is 1024.\\n\\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\\n\\n*   The current offer gives me a total value of 1024. This is greater than my outside offer of 769. However, since this is Round 2, I need to consider the discount factor. If I accept, my value will be 1024 * 0.9^(2-1) = 1024 * 0.9 = 921.6\\n* Since 921.6 > 769, accepting is better than walking away. However, I might be able to get a better outcome through another counteroffer.\\n*   Let's consider some potential counteroffers, thinking about what would be a reasonable split. We can try to keep 2 units of every item and give the rest away to player 1, where that's possible. \\n*    Keep [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]. Give [0, 5, 1, 1, 4] to player 1. My value for that would be (2 * 7) + (2 * 77) + (2 * 58) + (2 * 55) + (2 * 22) = 14 + 154 + 116 + 110 + 44 = 438. This is too low.\\n* Let's keep [1, 4, 2, 2, 4]. Offer [1, 3, 1, 1, 2]. My value for this is (1 * 7) + (4 * 77) + (2 * 58) + (2 * 55) + (4 * 22) = 7 + 308 + 116 + 110 + 88 = 629. This is still less than my outside offer value.\\n* I could counteroffer with a split where I keep more valuable items. Since I value item 2 the highest, then item 3 and 4, let's try to keep most of those and make a counteroffer keeping [1, 6, 3, 2, 1]. Offering player 1: [1, 1, 0, 1, 5]\\nMy value is (1*7) + (6*77) + (3*58) + (2*55) + (1*22) = 7 + 462 + 174 + 110 + 22 = 775. Still less than my outside offer\\n* I could offer [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]. This implies keeping [2, 5, 3, 3, 6] items. My value would be (2*7) + (5*77) + (3*58) + (3*55) + (6*22) = 14 + 385 + 174 + 165 + 132 = 870. This is greater than my outside offer, 870*0.9 = 783 which is also greater than 769.\\n* Since this is round 2, I should not be offering so little. My outside offer discounted is 769, my value in the current offer is 921.6, and my offer of [0,2,0,0,0] would be 783.

      "    These mistakes are:\n",

      "    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n",
      "\n",
      "    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n",
      "    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 2, 7, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n",

      "    which is less than your outside offer of 802. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n",

This would mean I keep [2, 2, 1, 3, 6] which is worth: 2 * 34 + 2 * 6 + 1 * 60 + 3 * 2 + 6 * 22 = 68 + 12 + 60 + 6 + 132 = 278.\\n    *   **Option 4: Offer more of items 1 and 2:** Offer Player 2 [2, 2, 1, 3, 3].

      "    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n",
      "    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n",
      "    These mistakes are:\n",
      "    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n",
      "    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n",
      "    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n",
      "    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n",
      "    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n",
      "\n",
      "    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n",
      "    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 5, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n",
      "    34 x 0 + 6 x 0 + 60 x 1 + 2 x 5 + 22 x 7\n",
      "    which is 224 (sum of all item values) \n",
      "    \n",
      "    which is less than your outside offer of 226. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n",
      "    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n",

      "    Let's walk through this step by step:\n",
      "\n",
      "    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n",
      "       - What is my outside offer value?\n",
      "       - What are the values of the items involved?\n",
      "       - What is the total pool of items?\n",
      "       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n",
      "\n",
      "    2) Assess the value of offers:\n",
      "       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n",
      "       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n",
      "       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n",
      "\n",
      "    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n",
      "       - Should I accept the current offer?\n",
      "       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n",
      "       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n",
      "\n",
      "    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n",
      "    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n",
      "    These mistakes are:\n",
      "    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n",
      "    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n",
      "    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n",
      "    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n",
      "    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n",
      "\n",
      "    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n",
      "    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 6, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n",
      "    20 x 0 + 73 x 1 + 63 x 0 + 12 x 6 + 14 x 7\n",
      "    which is 243 (sum of all item values) \n",
      "    \n",
      "    which is less than your outside offer of 244. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n",
      "    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n",
      "\n",

This is less than the outside offer. So this is a bad offer for me.\\n    *   Let's try giving player 1: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I would keep [4, 4, 4, 3, 2]\\n        * My value would then be (4 * 99) + (4 * 82) + (4 * 21) + (3 * 22) + (2 * 98) = 396 + 328 + 84 + 66 + 196 = 1070. This is greater than my outside offer.\\n\\n**3) Make a decision:**\\n\\n*   The current offer is unacceptable because it's far below my outside offer.\\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that provides me with a value greater than my outside offer. Giving Player 1 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] results in a value of 1070. I will propose this as my first counteroffer.\\n*   I will propose a counteroffer giving away one unit of item 3: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\\n\\n**Action:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"COUNTEROFFER\\\", \\\"offer\\\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\\n```\\n\"\n",

      "    Let's walk through this step by step:\n",

      "       - What are the values of the items involved?\n",
      "       - What is the total pool of items?\n",
      "       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n",
      "\n",
      "    2) Assess the value of offers:\n",
      "       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n",
      "       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n",
      "       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n",
      "\n",
      "    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n",
      "       - Should I accept the current offer?\n",
      "       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n",
      "       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n",

      "    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n",
      "    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n",
      "    These mistakes are:\n",
      "    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n",
      "    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n",
      "    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n",
      "    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n",
      "    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n",
      "\n",
      "    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n",
      "    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 5, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n",
      "    84 x 3 + 49 x 2 + 28 x 5 + 49 x 3 + 16 x 0\n",
      "    which is 637 (sum of all item values) \n",
      "    \n",
      "    which is less than your outside offer of 638. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n",
      "    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n",

This means I would receive 1 unit of item 3, and the remaining items (4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5).\\n    My value for accepting this offer, before the discount is:\\n    (4 * 84) + (4 * 49) + (4 * 28) + (3 * 49) + (2 * 16) + (1 * 28) = 336 + 196 + 112 + 147 + 32 + 28 = 851\\n    Applying the discount, my value would be: 851 * 0.9 = 765.9\\n*   **Counteroffer Considerations:** I need to propose a counteroffer that provides a value of more than 638 * 1/0.9 = 708.89 to make it a better outcome, if I accepted it this round, to walking. Any offer that results in the value after a discount to be greater than 638 would be a more advantageous outcome than just walking away.\\n    *   Mistake 2: My counteroffer should result in a value of more than 638 after it has been discounted by 0.9.\\n    *  Mistake 1: My counteroffer should not be worse than my previous offer. My last offer was [0,0,4,0,2] which had a discounted value of 851 * .9 = 765.9 for me. This is better than my outside offer of 638.\\n\\nLet's consider some potential counteroffers:\\nIf I offer [0,0,0,0,0], I keep everything and my value is 851 * .9 = 765.9\\nIf I offer [1,1,1,1,1] to Player 2, I keep [3,3,4,2,1] and my value is (3 * 84) + (3 * 49) + (4 * 28) + (2 * 49) + (1 * 16) = 252 + 147 + 112 + 98 + 16 = 625. 625 * 0.9 = 562.5 This is lower than the outside offer. This would be Mistake 2\\nIf I offer [1,1,0,1,0], I keep [3,3,5,2,2] and my value is (3 * 84) + (3 * 49) + (5 * 28) + (2 * 49) + (2 * 16) = 252 + 147 + 140 + 98 + 32 = 669. 669 * 0.9 = 602.1. This is less than my outside offer. This would be Mistake 2\\nIf I offer [0,0,1,0,0], I keep [4,4,4,3,2] and my value is 851. 851 * 0.9 = 765.9.\\nIf I offer [0,0,2,0,0], I keep [4,4,3,3,2] and my value is 851 - 56 = 795. 795 * .9 = 715.5\\nIf I offer [0,0,3,0,0], I keep [4,4,2,3,2] and my value is 851 - 84 = 767. 767 * .9 = 690.3.\\nIf I offer [0,0,0,0,1], I keep [4,4,5,3,1] and my value is 851 - 16 = 835. 835 * .9 = 751.5\\nIf I offer [0,0,0,1,0], I keep [4,4,5,2,2] and my value is 851 - 49 = 802. 802 * .9 = 721.8\\nIf I offer [1,0,0,0,0] I keep [3,4,5,3,2] and my value is 851-84= 767. 767 * 0.9 = 690.3\\nIf I offer [0,1,0,0,0] I keep [4,3,5,3,2] and my value is 851-49= 802. 802 * 0.9 = 721.8\\nIf I offer [2,0,0,0,0] I keep [2,4,5,3,2] and my value is 851 - 168 = 683. 683 * 0.9 = 614.7.

If I accept, my total value would be 765.9, which is better than my outside offer of 638. \\nMy previous offer was [0,0,4,0,2]. Any counteroffer that is significantly different may signal a poor strategy to the opposing agent.\\nGiven that the current offer of [0,0,1,0,0] is better than my outside offer, and I have already tried to extract additional items, the best course of action here is to accept the current offer of [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] from Player 2.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\\"action\\\": \\\"ACCEPT\\\"}\\n```\\n\"\n",
