                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 10 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 34 for item 1, 86 for item 2, 57 for item 3, 1 for item 4, 6 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 745. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 207. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 207. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 552 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 3, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 1 + 86 x 0 + 57 x 3 + 1 x 1 + 6 x 0\n    which is 206 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 207. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 207.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 34\n    *   Item 2: 86\n    *   Item 3: 57\n    *   Item 4: 1\n    *   Item 5: 6\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 10\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 0\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. The discount factor will be relevant in later rounds, but for round 1, it does not influence the decision. It would only play a role if we are considering future rounds as part of our current decision. We aren't doing that here.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what kind of offer to propose to Player 2 that is better than my outside offer and also strategically sound.\n\n    I need to formulate a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 207. A starting point is to retain most of the items for which I have a high value and offer a small amount of the other items to Player 2. A valid offer has to be a valid division of the number of units available for each item.\n\n    Let's first calculate the value if I kept all the items myself:\n    10 * 34 + 2 * 86 + 4 * 57 + 5 * 1 + 0 * 6 = 340 + 172 + 228 + 5 + 0 = 745\n\n    Since my outside offer is 207, it seems that keeping everything gives me a much higher value, so I will begin making offers and checking the value that I get for each.\n    \n    I need to make a valid counteroffer so I must offer a non-zero amount to Player 2.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 2: [3,1,1,1,0].\n    Then I would keep [7,1,3,4,0].\n    My value would be: 7*34 + 1*86 + 3*57 + 4*1 + 0*6 = 238 + 86 + 171 + 4 + 0 = 499.\n\n    This seems good, as it's better than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's see what happens if I offer [4,2,2,2,0] to Player 2. This would mean keeping [6,0,2,3,0].\n    My value would be: 6*34 + 0*86 + 2*57 + 3*1 + 0*6 = 204 + 0 + 114 + 3 + 0 = 321.\n    This is also good. Let's see what would happen if I offer more.\n\n    Let's try offering [5,1,2,3,0]. This would mean I would keep [5,1,2,2,0].\n    My value is 5*34 + 1*86 + 2*57 + 2*1 + 0*6 = 170 + 86 + 114 + 2 + 0 = 372.\n    This is also okay, but lower than my previous offer.\n\n    Let's offer [3,1,1,1,0] to player 2. This means that I would keep [7,1,3,4,0]\n    My value would be 7*34 + 1*86 + 3*57 + 4*1 + 0*6 = 238 + 86 + 171 + 4 + 0 = 499. This seems like a reasonable first offer.\n    \n**3) Make a decision:**\n\nBased on my analysis, I should make a counteroffer. Offering Player 2 [3, 1, 1, 1, 0] keeps a substantial value for myself while starting the negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 2, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 3 + 6 x 1 + 25 x 2 + 30 x 5 + 99 x 0\n    which is 320 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 321. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 321\n*   **My item values:** 38 for item 1, 6 for item 2, 25 for item 3, 30 for item 4, 99 for item 5.\n*   **Total pool of items:** 10 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less. Specifically, accepting in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value, and accepting in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value compared to round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 38 = 114\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 6 = 6\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 25 = 25\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 30 = 30\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 99 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 114 + 6 + 25 + 30 + 0 = 175. This does not yet consider the discount factor. In this round, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 175, which is less than my outside offer of 321. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine a counteroffer that is better for me than my outside offer after discounting. I will construct my counteroffer to take as many of the valuable items as possible and maximize my value.\n\n    *   My total item values are 38 * 10 + 6 * 2 + 25 * 4 + 30 * 5 + 99 * 0 = 380 + 12 + 100 + 150 + 0 = 642.\n    *   Let's start by keeping all of item 5, since it is the most valuable, but there are 0 of these to keep. I will then keep as many item 4s as possible and go down the list.\n    *   Let's try keeping: \n        *   7 units of item 1\n        *   1 units of item 2\n        *   3 units of item 3\n        *   4 units of item 4\n        *   0 units of item 5\n\n        This means I will offer the other player\n        *   3 units of item 1\n        *   1 unit of item 2\n        *   1 unit of item 3\n        *   1 unit of item 4\n        *   0 units of item 5\n\n        The total value for me would be:\n        7 * 38 + 1 * 6 + 3 * 25 + 4 * 30 + 0 * 99 = 266 + 6 + 75 + 120 + 0 = 467\n        467 > 321\n        So, this is a valid counteroffer as it is greater than the outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer, as it is worth less than my outside offer.\n*   I should not walk away, as I can make an offer better than my outside offer.\n*   I should make a counteroffer that improves my value, and that would be offer [3, 1, 1, 1, 0] to Player 1\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 207. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 207. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 552 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 3, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 1 + 86 x 0 + 57 x 3 + 1 x 1 + 6 x 0\n    which is 206 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 207. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 207\n*   **My item values:** \n    *   Item 1: 34\n    *   Item 2: 86\n    *   Item 3: 57\n    *   Item 4: 1\n    *   Item 5: 6\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 10\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 0\n*  **Discount factor:** The current round is round 2, so the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means that an outcome in the current round is worth 90% of its undiscounted value.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is that I receive [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]. This means that I keep:\n    * Item 1: 3 units * 34 = 102\n    * Item 2: 1 unit * 86 = 86\n    * Item 3: 1 unit * 57 = 57\n    * Item 4: 1 unit * 1 = 1\n    * Item 5: 0 units * 6 = 0\n    * Total undiscounted value = 102 + 86 + 57 + 1 + 0 = 246\n    * Total discounted value: 246 * 0.9 = 221.4.\n\n*   **Comparison to my outside offer:** The current offer gives me a value of 221.4, which is higher than my outside offer of 207. Therefore, accepting the offer is better than walking away right now.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nSince the current offer is better than my outside offer, and it is already round 2, it is best to accept it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 342. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 495 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 22 x 2 + 99 x 3 + 8 x 0 + 24 x 0\n    which is 341 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 342. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 342.\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 12 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 22 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 99 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 8 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 24 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:** 2 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. Since it's round 1, it does not yet affect the value of any offers.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so accepting it isn't an option.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to create an initial offer to Player 2. My total possible value is:\n    (2 * 12) + (7 * 22) + (3 * 99) + (3 * 8) + (6 * 24) = 24 + 154 + 297 + 24 + 144 = 643\n\n    I want to make an offer that is good for me but also reasonable enough that Player 2 might consider accepting it, rather than walking away. I will try to maximize my value while not offering everything. Offering nothing would be a mistake in the first round.\n    Let me assess a few potential offers:\n\n    *   **Offer 1:**  Give Player 2 half of everything, rounding down when necessary. So: [1, 3, 1, 1, 3]. This would mean keeping [1, 4, 2, 2, 3] for myself. Value = (1 * 12) + (4 * 22) + (2 * 99) + (2 * 8) + (3 * 24) = 12 + 88 + 198 + 16 + 72 = 386. This is greater than my outside offer.\n   *    **Offer 2:** Be more aggressive. I'll try to keep most of my higher value items. Keep [2, 5, 3, 2, 4]. Offer [0, 2, 0, 1, 2].\n     Value = (2 * 12) + (5 * 22) + (3 * 99) + (2 * 8) + (4 * 24) = 24 + 110 + 297 + 16 + 96 = 543. This is much greater than my outside offer.\n     *   **Offer 3:** Be slightly less aggressive. Keep [2, 4, 2, 2, 3]. Offer [0, 3, 1, 1, 3]. Value = (2 * 12) + (4 * 22) + (2 * 99) + (2 * 8) + (3 * 24) = 24 + 88 + 198 + 16 + 72 = 398. This is still greater than my outside offer.\n\n    Offer 2 seems good since it maximizes my value, though I will choose a slightly less aggressive offer in the first round to be sure. Offer 3 looks like a good first round offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer since there is no current offer.\n*   I should not walk away since my outside offer is lower than what I can potentially get if I negotiate a good deal.\n*   I should propose counteroffer [0, 3, 1, 1, 3], as that is a good initial offer that gives me a value of 398, which is greater than my outside offer of 342.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 1, 3]}\n```\n",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 769\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 7, Item 2: 77, Item 3: 58, Item 4: 55, Item 5: 22\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 2, Item 2: 7, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. The discount factor doesn't affect my decision in this round but will affect the value of an outcome if we reach future rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 3, 1, 1, 3]. This means I would get:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 7 = 0\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 77 = 231\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 58 = 58\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 55 = 55\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 22 = 66\n    *   **Total value of current offer:** 0 + 231 + 58 + 55 + 66 = 410\n\n    This is less than my outside option of 769.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to craft a counteroffer that gives me more than 769. This means I need to keep items that are of high value to me. I'll start by keeping as many item 2s, 3s, and 4s as possible.\n\n    *   Let's try keeping [2, 4, 2, 2, 3] and offering [0, 3, 1, 1, 3].\n        *   Value: (2 * 7) + (4 * 77) + (2 * 58) + (2 * 55) + (3 * 22) = 14 + 308 + 116 + 110 + 66 = 614 This is less than 769.\n    *   Let's try keeping [2, 5, 2, 2, 3] and offering [0, 2, 1, 1, 3].\n        *   Value: (2 * 7) + (5 * 77) + (2 * 58) + (2 * 55) + (3 * 22) = 14 + 385 + 116 + 110 + 66 = 691 This is less than 769.\n    *   Let's try keeping [2, 6, 3, 3, 3] and offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 3].\n        *   Value: (2 * 7) + (6 * 77) + (3 * 58) + (3 * 55) + (3 * 22) = 14 + 462 + 174 + 165 + 66 = 881 This is greater than 769.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 410, less than my outside offer of 769. So I should not accept.\n*   Keeping [2, 6, 3, 3, 3] and offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 3] to Player 1 yields a value of 881. This is better than my outside offer and doesn't make any of the 5 mistakes.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer to give the other player [0, 1, 0, 0, 3].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 3]}\n```\n",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 2 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 12 for item 1, 22 for item 2, 99 for item 3, 8 for item 4, 24 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 643. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 342. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 342. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 495 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 22 x 2 + 99 x 3 + 8 x 0 + 24 x 0\n    which is 341 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 342. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 7 - 1 = 6\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 6 - 3 = 3\n    My total value for this offer: (2 * 12) + (6 * 22) + (3 * 99) + (3 * 8) + (3 * 24) = 24 + 132 + 297 + 24 + 72 = 549\n    Adjusted value for round 2: 549 * 0.9 = 494.1\n\n*   **Previous offer by Player 1**: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 1, 3] to Player 2. This means I would keep:\n    * Item 1: 2\n    * Item 2: 4\n    * Item 3: 2\n    * Item 4: 2\n    * Item 5: 3\n    Value of this offer to me: (2 * 12) + (4 * 22) + (2 * 99) + (2 * 8) + (3 * 24) = 24 + 88 + 198 + 16 + 72 = 398\n     Adjusted value for round 1: 398 * 1 = 398\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    Since the current offer is good for me, lets just see what the value would be if I just kept everything myself.\n    *   Item 1: 2\n    *   Item 2: 7\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 6\n    Value of keeping everything: (2 * 12) + (7 * 22) + (3 * 99) + (3 * 8) + (6 * 24) = 24 + 154 + 297 + 24 + 144 = 643\n\n    If I offer player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and keep everything, I get 643 * 0.9 = 578.7\n    If I offer player 2 [0, 1, 0, 0, 3] I get 494.1, which I have already calculated\n     If I offer player 2 [1, 2, 1, 1, 3], then I keep [1, 5, 2, 2, 3], which is:\n     (1 * 12) + (5 * 22) + (2 * 99) + (2 * 8) + (3 * 24) = 12 + 110 + 198 + 16 + 72 = 408\n     408*0.9 = 367.2\n\n    Let's try an offer that is a bit better for Player 2, like [0, 2, 1, 1, 4]. This means I keep: [2,5,2,2,2]\n    Value to me is:  (2 * 12) + (5 * 22) + (2 * 99) + (2 * 8) + (2 * 24) = 24 + 110 + 198 + 16 + 48 = 396\n    396 * 0.9 = 356.4\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Current offer (494.1) is significantly better than my outside offer (342).\n    *   The potential counter offer of keeping everything (578.7) is very high.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 494.1, which is greater than my outside offer of 342, so I should not walk away.\n*   It is a good offer, but I could get more if I make a counteroffer.\n*   I could offer something better for player 2, but that would lower my payoff, so I should offer as little as possible and still ensure that I don't violate the five rules.\n*   I will make a counteroffer that gives Player 2 nothing.\n   \n   This means I offer [0,0,0,0,0] to Player 2 and get to keep [2,7,3,3,6] for myself.\n   This gives me a value of: 2*12 + 7*22 + 3*99 + 3*8 + 6*24 = 24 + 154 + 297 + 24 + 144 = 643\n   And with the discount applied 643*0.9=578.7\n\n**Final Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                {
                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 2 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 7 for item 1, 77 for item 2, 58 for item 3, 55 for item 4, 22 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1024. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 769. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 769. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 3, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 0 + 77 x 5 + 58 x 3 + 55 x 3 + 22 x 2\n    which is 768 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 769. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 769.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 7\n    *   Item 2: 77\n    *   Item 3: 58\n    *   Item 4: 55\n    *   Item 5: 22\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2\n    *   Item 2: 7\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an agreement in round 2 is worth 0.9 times what it would be in round 1, and in round 3 it would be worth 0.81 times what it would be in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep all items: [2, 7, 3, 3, 6]. My value for this is (2 * 7) + (7 * 77) + (3 * 58) + (3 * 55) + (6 * 22) = 14 + 539 + 174 + 165 + 132 = 1024.\n*   **Counteroffers:** I need to think about reasonable counteroffers that are better than my outside offer. My total value without any discount is 1024.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer gives me a total value of 1024. This is greater than my outside offer of 769. However, since this is Round 2, I need to consider the discount factor. If I accept, my value will be 1024 * 0.9^(2-1) = 1024 * 0.9 = 921.6\n* Since 921.6 > 769, accepting is better than walking away. However, I might be able to get a better outcome through another counteroffer.\n*   Let's consider some potential counteroffers, thinking about what would be a reasonable split. We can try to keep 2 units of every item and give the rest away to player 1, where that's possible. \n*    Keep [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]. Give [0, 5, 1, 1, 4] to player 1. My value for that would be (2 * 7) + (2 * 77) + (2 * 58) + (2 * 55) + (2 * 22) = 14 + 154 + 116 + 110 + 44 = 438. This is too low.\n* Let's keep [1, 4, 2, 2, 4]. Offer [1, 3, 1, 1, 2]. My value for this is (1 * 7) + (4 * 77) + (2 * 58) + (2 * 55) + (4 * 22) = 7 + 308 + 116 + 110 + 88 = 629. This is still less than my outside offer value.\n* I could counteroffer with a split where I keep more valuable items. Since I value item 2 the highest, then item 3 and 4, let's try to keep most of those and make a counteroffer keeping [1, 6, 3, 2, 1]. Offering player 1: [1, 1, 0, 1, 5]\nMy value is (1*7) + (6*77) + (3*58) + (2*55) + (1*22) = 7 + 462 + 174 + 110 + 22 = 775. Still less than my outside offer\n* I could offer [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]. This implies keeping [2, 5, 3, 3, 6] items. My value would be (2*7) + (5*77) + (3*58) + (3*55) + (6*22) = 14 + 385 + 174 + 165 + 132 = 870. This is greater than my outside offer, 870*0.9 = 783 which is also greater than 769.\n* Since this is round 2, I should not be offering so little. My outside offer discounted is 769, my value in the current offer is 921.6, and my offer of [0,2,0,0,0] would be 783. The best value is to accept the current offer.\n\n**Decision:** Accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 802. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 802. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 789 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 2, 7, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 1 + 8 x 5 + 34 x 2 + 88 x 7 + 57 x 0\n    which is 800 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 802. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1 in round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 802\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 76\n    *   Item 2: 8\n    *   Item 3: 34\n    *   Item 4: 88\n    *   Item 5: 57\n*   **Total item pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 7 units\n    *   Item 5: 0 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  The discount factor will apply to the outcome if a deal is reached in later rounds. It does not affect the value of walking away now. Since this is round one, the discount factor does not need to be applied to the value of my offers at this point.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** We need to propose a counteroffer that is better than our outside offer of 802. Let's explore some options.\n    *   If I were to keep everything for myself, that would be 5 * 76 + 5 * 8 + 3 * 34 + 7 * 88 + 0 * 57 = 380 + 40 + 102 + 616 + 0 = 1138. This is my maximum possible value, but not a viable offer.\n    *   Let's consider an even split where player 2 gets half of everything:\n    Player 1 keeps: [2, 2, 1, 3, 0] and gives player 2 [3, 3, 2, 4, 0]\n    Player 1 value: 2*76 + 2*8 + 1*34 + 3*88 + 0*57 = 152 + 16 + 34 + 264 + 0 = 466. \n    This is less than our outside offer so it would be a bad idea.\n    *   Let's try offering player 2 just a small amount of each item.\n    Player 1 keeps: [4, 4, 2, 6, 0] and gives player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n    Player 1 value: 4*76 + 4*8 + 2*34 + 6*88 + 0*57 = 304 + 32 + 68 + 528 + 0 = 932. \n    This is better than our outside offer of 802, so this is a good starting point.\n    *   Let's try offering more to player 2.\n    Player 1 keeps: [3, 3, 1, 5, 0] and gives player 2 [2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n    Player 1 value: 3*76 + 3*8 + 1*34 + 5*88 + 0*57 = 228 + 24 + 34 + 440 = 726. \n    This is not good because it's less than our outside offer.\n    \n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, we will propose an initial counteroffer. Offering [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] to player 2 results in a value of 932, which is better than our outside offer of 802.\nWe will make the offer to give 1 unit of each item (except item 5) to player 2.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 1 + 26 x 0 + 96 x 0 + 2 x 5 + 26 x 0\n    which is 101 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 102. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 102. This is my guaranteed value if we don't reach a deal.\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 91\n    *   Item 2: 26\n    *   Item 3: 96\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 26\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times as much as a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 times as much as a deal in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]. This means they keep [4, 4, 2, 6, 0].\n    *   My value from the current offer:\n        *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 91 = 91\n        *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 26 = 26\n        *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 96 = 96\n        *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 2 = 2\n        *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 26 = 0\n        *   Total value: 91 + 26 + 96 + 2 + 0 = 215\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer that would be better than my outside offer. My goal is to maximize my value.  A good initial strategy is to try to get all the high value items while only offering them the low value items. Let's propose to offer them just the item 4s, with one exception in case item 4 has some value to them.\n  * Keeping [5, 5, 3, 6, 0] for me and offer [0,0,0,1,0] to them.\n    * My value from the counteroffer:\n        * 5 units of item 1: 5 * 91 = 455\n        * 5 units of item 2: 5 * 26 = 130\n        * 3 units of item 3: 3 * 96 = 288\n        * 6 units of item 4: 6 * 2 = 12\n        * 0 units of item 5: 0 * 26 = 0\n        * Total value = 455 + 130 + 288 + 12 + 0 = 885\n\n    *   My current offer value of 215 is much better than my outside offer value of 102. It would be a mistake to walk away from this deal if offered it. However, I believe I can get a better offer. My counteroffer of [0,0,0,1,0] would be better for me than my outside offer of 102.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 215, which is much better than my outside offer of 102. However, I can get an even better value.\n*   A counteroffer where I keep the high value items and only give the low value items to player 1 provides a much better value.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 802. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 802. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 789 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 2, 7, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 1 + 8 x 5 + 34 x 2 + 88 x 7 + 57 x 0\n    which is 800 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 802. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 802\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 76, Item 2: 8, Item 3: 34, Item 4: 88, Item 5: 57\n*   **Total items:** 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be applied as 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 0 = 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 0 = 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 7 - 1 = 6 units\n    *   Item 5: 0 - 0 = 0 units\n    My value for this offer is: (5 * 76) + (5 * 8) + (3 * 34) + (6 * 88) + (0 * 57) = 380 + 40 + 102 + 528 + 0 = 1050.\n    With the discount factor applied, the current offer value is 1050 * 0.9 = 945.\n\n*   **Previous offer:** Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] to Player 2. This means I would keep [4, 4, 2, 6, 0]\n     My value would have been 4*76 + 4*8 + 2*34 + 6*88 = 304 + 32 + 68 + 528 = 932\n    The discounted value of the previous offer is 932 * 0.9^0 = 932\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few options:\n    *   **Option 1 (Keep more):** Offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would keep [5, 5, 3, 7, 0]. My value is 5*76 + 5*8 + 3*34 + 7*88 + 0*57 = 380 + 40 + 102 + 616 + 0 = 1138.  Discounted, this is 1138 * 0.9 = 1024.2\n    *   **Option 2 (Offer More):** Offer Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]. This means I would keep [4, 4, 2, 6, 0]. My value is 4*76 + 4*8 + 2*34 + 6*88 + 0*57 = 304 + 32 + 68 + 528 + 0 = 932. Discounted, this is 932* 0.9 = 838.8\n     \n    *   **Option 3 (Offer Slightly Less):** Offer Player 2 [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This means I would keep [4, 4, 3, 6, 0]. My value is 4*76 + 4*8 + 3*34 + 6*88 + 0*57= 304+32+102+528=966. Discounted, this is 966 * 0.9=869.4\n   \n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer gives me a discounted value of 945, which is better than my outside offer of 802. Option 1 has a discounted value of 1024.2 and Option 2 has a discounted value of 838.8 and Option 3 has a discounted value of 869.4 all of which are better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is acceptable (945 > 802).\n*   Option 1 offers a better discounted value of 1024.2\n*   Option 2 offers a worse discounted value of 838.8\n*   Option 3 offers a better discounted value of 869.4\n    \nGiven that we are in round 2, and if I make a counteroffer in the final round, it will be treated as a walk, and I'd get my outside offer of 802.\n\nSo, since the current offer (adjusted for discount) is better than my outside offer, and it is now round 2, I should accept the offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 226. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 226. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 372 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 5, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 0 + 6 x 0 + 60 x 1 + 2 x 5 + 22 x 7\n    which is 224 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 226. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1 in round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 226\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 34 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 6 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 60 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 2 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 22 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 7 units\n    *   Item 5: 8 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value of a deal in round 1. Since it is round 1, the discount rate is irrelevant for this round's decision making.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I need to make an initial offer, I'll evaluate a few options to make an informed decision. My goal is to propose an offer that is better than my outside offer for me, which means I keep items that will be valued at greater than 226. I will also try to avoid making mistakes 2 and 3.\n\n    *   **Option 1: Offer half of each item:** Offer Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 3, 4]. This would mean I keep [2, 2, 1, 4, 4] which is worth: 2 * 34 + 2 * 6 + 1 * 60 + 4 * 2 + 4 * 22 = 68 + 12 + 60 + 8 + 88 = 236.\n    *   **Option 2: Offer slightly more than half to player 2:** Offer Player 2 [1, 2, 1, 4, 5]. This would mean I keep [2, 1, 1, 3, 3] which is worth: 2 * 34 + 1 * 6 + 1 * 60 + 3 * 2 + 3 * 22 = 68 + 6 + 60 + 6 + 66 = 206.\n    *   **Option 3: Offer less of item 5, and more of item 4:** Offer Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 4, 2]. This would mean I keep [2, 2, 1, 3, 6] which is worth: 2 * 34 + 2 * 6 + 1 * 60 + 3 * 2 + 6 * 22 = 68 + 12 + 60 + 6 + 132 = 278.\n    *   **Option 4: Offer more of items 1 and 2:** Offer Player 2 [2, 2, 1, 3, 3]. This means I keep [1, 1, 1, 4, 5] which is worth: 1 * 34 + 1 * 6 + 1 * 60 + 4 * 2 + 5 * 22 = 34 + 6 + 60 + 8 + 110 = 218.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** Option 1 has value of 236 which is > 226, option 2 has value of 206 which is < 226, option 3 has value of 278 which is > 226, and option 4 has value 218, which is < 226. So, options 1 and 3 are valid, and I'll choose to offer option 3 since it yields the best outcome for me.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will not accept because there is no current offer.\n*   I will not walk away, as I can make an offer that is better than my outside offer.\n*   I will make a counteroffer that is option 3.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 4, 2]}\n```\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 6, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 73 x 1 + 63 x 0 + 12 x 6 + 14 x 7\n    which is 243 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 244. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 4, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 4, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 244.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values are 20 for item 1, 73 for item 2, 63 for item 3, 12 for item 4, and 14 for item 5.\n*   **Total Items:** There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, and 8 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor gamma is 0.9. This means that if a deal is reached in round 2, the value is multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9, and in round 3, it is multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81.\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 4, 2] of items 1-5 respectively.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer Value:**\n    *   1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 20 = 20\n    *   1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 73 = 73\n    *   1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 63 = 63\n    *   4 units of item 4 = 4 * 12 = 48\n    *   2 units of item 5 = 2 * 14 = 28\n    *   Total Value of Current Offer = 20 + 73 + 63 + 48 + 28 = 232\n*   **Current Offer Value vs Outside Offer:** 232 < 244.  The current offer is worse than my outside offer. I will not accept this offer.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to come up with an offer that will give me more than 244, which means that I will keep the items that are valued more highly by me, and give up those less valued to Player 1. I will calculate the value if I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and then increment up items until my total offer exceeds my outside offer value.\n    *   Keeping [3, 3, 2, 7, 8]: 3*20 + 3*73 + 2*63 + 7*12 + 8*14 = 60+219+126+84+112= 601 (giving nothing away)\n    *   Keeping [3, 3, 2, 6, 7]: 3*20 + 3*73 + 2*63 + 6*12 + 7*14 = 60+219+126+72+98 = 575.\n    *   Keeping [3, 3, 2, 5, 6]: 3*20 + 3*73 + 2*63 + 5*12 + 6*14 = 60+219+126+60+84= 549.\n    *   Keeping [3, 3, 2, 4, 5]: 3*20 + 3*73 + 2*63 + 4*12 + 5*14 = 60+219+126+48+70= 523.\n    *   Keeping [3, 3, 2, 3, 4]: 3*20 + 3*73 + 2*63 + 3*12 + 4*14 = 60+219+126+36+56= 497.\n    *   Keeping [3, 3, 2, 2, 3]: 3*20 + 3*73 + 2*63 + 2*12 + 3*14 = 60+219+126+24+42= 471.\n    *   Keeping [3, 3, 2, 1, 2]: 3*20 + 3*73 + 2*63 + 1*12 + 2*14 = 60+219+126+12+28= 445.\n    *   Keeping [3, 3, 2, 0, 1]: 3*20 + 3*73 + 2*63 + 0*12 + 1*14 = 60+219+126+0+14= 419\n    *  Keeping [3, 2, 2, 0, 0]: 3*20 + 2*73 + 2*63 + 0*12 + 0*14 = 60+146+126 = 332.\n    *  Keeping [3, 1, 1, 0, 0]: 3*20 + 1*73 + 1*63 + 0*12 + 0*14 = 60+73+63 = 196\n    *  Keeping [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]: 2*20 + 1*73 + 1*63 + 0*12 + 0*14 = 40 + 73 + 63 = 176\n    \n    Offering [0, 1, 0, 7, 8] results in me keeping [3, 2, 2, 0, 0]. This has a value of 332.\n    Offering [0, 0, 0, 7, 8] results in me keeping [3, 3, 2, 0, 0]. This has a value of 332.\n    I want to keep more of the items that I value, but I should also keep in mind what is likely to be important to Player 1, so I don't make an offer that is rejected out of hand. Player 1 will want the items that have a high value to them, so it is likely that they also value item 3 and 4 highly.\n\n    Therefore I will offer Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 6, 7], which leaves me with [3, 2, 2, 1, 1].\n    Value: 3*20 + 2*73 + 2*63 + 1*12 + 1*14 = 60 + 146 + 126 + 12 + 14 = 358\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer (232 < 244).\n*   My counteroffer yields 358, which is greater than 244. Therefore, this is not mistake 2, as I keep more than the value of my outside offer.\n* I am not offering no items or all items, which would be mistake 3.\n*   I will make a counteroffer to maximize my value while keeping in mind what Player 1 values, aiming for a deal that will be accepted or result in a second negotiation round.\n*   I will offer the other player [0, 1, 0, 6, 7].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 6, 7]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 5, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 0 + 6 x 0 + 60 x 1 + 2 x 5 + 22 x 7\n    which is 224 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 226. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 4, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 6, 7]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 6, 7]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 226\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 34, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 60, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 22\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 7, Item 5: 8\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9 times its value, and if the deal is made in round 3 it will be 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer (from Player 2):** [0, 1, 0, 6, 7]. This means I keep 3-0 = 3 of item 1, 3-1 = 2 of item 2, 2-0 = 2 of item 3, 7-6 = 1 of item 4 and 8-7=1 of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer is: (3 * 34) + (2 * 6) + (2 * 60) + (1 * 2) + (1 * 22) = 102 + 12 + 120 + 2 + 22 = 258\n    *  Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 258 * 0.9 = 232.2.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that benefits me more than my outside offer and does not break any rules.  I will start with one that would be approximately equal to my outside offer and make adjustments from there. Let's try an offer where I keep [2, 2, 1, 2, 2], which is I offer [1,1,1,5,6]:\n    *   My value would be: (2 * 34) + (2 * 6) + (1 * 60) + (2 * 2) + (2 * 22) = 68 + 12 + 60 + 4 + 44 = 188.\n    This is less than my outside offer. Let's try offering [0,0,0,6,6], meaning I keep [3,3,2,1,2]:\n    *   My value would be: (3 * 34) + (3 * 6) + (2 * 60) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 22) = 102 + 18 + 120 + 2 + 44 = 286\n\n    *Let's try an offer where I keep [2, 1, 1, 1, 4], which is offering [1,2,1,6,4] to the opponent:\n    *  My value would be: (2 * 34) + (1 * 6) + (1 * 60) + (1 * 2) + (4 * 22) = 68 + 6 + 60 + 2 + 88 = 224. This is also not better than my outside offer.\n    * Let's try offering [1,1,1,5,3] to my opponent (keeping [2,2,1,2,5]):\n     * My value would be: (2 * 34) + (2 * 6) + (1 * 60) + (2 * 2) + (5 * 22) = 68+12+60+4+110 = 254. Discounted value is 254 * 0.9 = 228.6.\n    This is still better than my outside offer when discounted.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\n*   The current offer has a discounted value of 232.2, which is better than my outside offer of 226.\n*  I have also found a better offer, 228.6, which, though worse than accepting, may lead to a better outcome in the next round. It is therefore not in my best interest to accept this offer.\n*   I will make the counteroffer [1, 1, 1, 5, 3] in hopes that Player 2 accepts this offer and I obtain a value higher than my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 5, 3]}\n```\n",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 244. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 244. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 546 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 6, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 73 x 1 + 63 x 0 + 12 x 6 + 14 x 7\n    which is 243 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 244. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 4, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 6, 7]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 5, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 5, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current situation and decide on the best course of action.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n*   **My Outside Offer Value:** 244\n*   **My Item Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 20\n    *   Item 2: 73\n    *   Item 3: 63\n    *   Item 4: 12\n    *   Item 5: 14\n*   **Total Pool of Items:** 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 2, if the process concludes this round, the overall value will be multiplied by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 5, 3]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 7 - 5 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 8 - 3 = 5\n\n    My value from accepting this offer:\n    (2 * 20) + (2 * 73) + (1 * 63) + (2 * 12) + (5 * 14) = 40 + 146 + 63 + 24 + 70 = 343\n    \n    The discounted value is 343 * 0.9 = 308.7\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's consider a few potential counteroffers and calculate their value:\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1: Keep most of the valuable items:** Offer Player 1 [0,0,0,6,7]. This means I keep [3,3,2,1,1]:\n      (3 * 20) + (3 * 73) + (2 * 63) + (1 * 12) + (1 * 14) = 60 + 219 + 126 + 12 + 14 = 431\n      \n    *   **Counteroffer 2: Keep a decent amount of everything:** Offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 4, 4] . This means I keep [2,2,1,3,4]:\n      (2 * 20) + (2 * 73) + (1 * 63) + (3 * 12) + (4 * 14) = 40 + 146 + 63 + 36 + 56 = 341\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 3: Offer the least valuable, keep the most valuable:** Offer Player 1 [2,2,2,0,0]. This means I keep [1,1,0,7,8]:\n       (1*20) + (1*73) + (0*63) + (7*12) + (8*14) = 20 + 73 + 0 + 84 + 112 = 289\n       \n    *  **Counteroffer 4 : Offer half of each item that is available:** Offer Player 1 [1,1,1,3,4]. This means I keep [2,2,1,4,4]:\n         (2*20) + (2*73) + (1*63) + (4*12) + (4*14) = 40 + 146 + 63 + 48 + 56 = 353\n  \n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n    *   Current offer (308.7) is better than my outside offer (244)\n    *   Counteroffer 1 (431) is much better than the outside offer.\n    *   Counteroffer 2 (341) is better than the outside offer.\n    *   Counteroffer 3 (289) is better than the outside offer.\n    *   Counteroffer 4 (353) is better than the outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n    * The current offer of 308.7 is better than my outside offer of 244, so I should not WALK.\n    *  Since I can make a better offer, I should not ACCEPT either. I will propose Counteroffer 1, since it gives me the largest value.\n    \n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 6, 7]}\n```\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 5, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 0 + 6 x 0 + 60 x 1 + 2 x 5 + 22 x 7\n    which is 224 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 226. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 4, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 6, 7]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 5, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 6, 7]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 6, 7]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 226\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 34\n    *   Item 2: 6\n    *   Item 3: 60\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 22\n*   **Total pool of items:** \n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 3\n    *   Item 3: 2\n    *   Item 4: 7\n    *   Item 5: 8\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This is round 3 so we have to account for the discount rate: 0.9 ^ (3-1) = 0.81. The value of accepting anything now is only worth 81% of that amount compared to if we had accepted an offer in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 6, 7]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 7 - 6 = 1\n    *   Item 5: 8 - 7 = 1\n   My value for the current offer is:\n    *   3 * 34 = 102\n    *   3 * 6 = 18\n    *   2 * 60 = 120\n    *   1 * 2 = 2\n    *   1 * 22 = 22\n    *   Total = 102 + 18 + 120 + 2 + 22 = 264\n   My discounted value for the current offer: 264 * (0.9 ^ 2) = 264 * 0.81 = 213.84\n    *   This is less than my outside offer of 226, so I shouldn't accept this offer\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's explore an offer that is better than my outside offer. I know Player 2 values item 4 and 5 highly, so I'll try to retain the higher value items for myself. Let's consider offering Player 2  [1, 1, 0, 4, 5]. This leaves me with:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 7 - 4 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 8 - 5 = 3\n    My value of this offer:\n    * 2 * 34 = 68\n    * 2 * 6 = 12\n    * 2 * 60 = 120\n    * 3 * 2 = 6\n    * 3 * 22 = 66\n    * Total: 68+12+120+6+66 = 272\n    Discounted Value: 272 * .81 = 220.32. This is still less than my outside offer. Let's try again.\n\n    Let's try keeping more of the high value items and offering [1, 1, 1, 4, 6]\n        *  Item 1: 3-1 = 2\n        *  Item 2: 3-1 = 2\n        *  Item 3: 2-1 = 1\n        *  Item 4: 7-4 = 3\n        *  Item 5: 8-6 = 2\n    My value of this offer:\n       * 2 * 34 = 68\n       * 2 * 6 = 12\n       * 1 * 60 = 60\n       * 3 * 2 = 6\n       * 2 * 22 = 44\n    Total = 190\n    Discounted value: 190 * .81 = 153.9\n    This is less than the outside offer.\n\n    Let's try offering [0, 0, 0, 5, 7]\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 7 - 5 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 8 - 7 = 1\n    My value:\n    * 3 * 34 = 102\n    * 3 * 6 = 18\n    * 2 * 60 = 120\n    * 2 * 2 = 4\n    * 1 * 22 = 22\n    * Total: 266\n    Discounted value: 266 * 0.81 = 215.46. This is still less than my outside offer.\n\n    Lets try keeping more of everything. What about offering [0, 1, 0, 6, 7].\n        * Item 1: 3-0=3\n        * Item 2: 3-1=2\n        * Item 3: 2-0=2\n        * Item 4: 7-6=1\n        * Item 5: 8-7=1\n     My value of this:\n         * 3 * 34 = 102\n         * 2 * 6 = 12\n         * 2 * 60 = 120\n         * 1 * 2 = 2\n         * 1 * 22 = 22\n    Total: 258.\n    Discounted value: 258 * 0.81 = 209. Still less than my outside offer.\n   \n    Let's try offering [0, 0, 0, 4, 6]. This leaves me:\n        *   Item 1: 3\n        *   Item 2: 3\n        *   Item 3: 2\n        *   Item 4: 3\n        *   Item 5: 2\n   Value: \n        * 3 * 34 = 102\n        * 3 * 6 = 18\n        * 2 * 60 = 120\n        * 3 * 2 = 6\n        * 2 * 22 = 44\n        Total: 290\n        Discounted: 290 * 0.81 = 234.9. This is better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n    The current offer is worse than my outside offer. I can make a counter offer of [0,0,0,4,6] and be better off.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 4, 6]}\n```\n",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 20 for item 1, 73 for item 2, 63 for item 3, 12 for item 4, 14 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 601. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 244. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 244. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 546 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 6, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 73 x 1 + 63 x 0 + 12 x 6 + 14 x 7\n    which is 243 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 244. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 4, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 6, 7]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 5, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 6, 7]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 4, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 4, 6]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 244\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 20\n    *   Item 2: 73\n    *   Item 3: 63\n    *   Item 4: 12\n    *   Item 5: 14\n*   **Total item pool:** 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 3, any accepted offer will be multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 4, 6].  This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 7 - 4 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 8 - 6 = 2\n\n    My value from accepting the current offer is:\n    (3 * 20) + (3 * 73) + (2 * 63) + (3 * 12) + (2 * 14) = 60 + 219 + 126 + 36 + 28 = 469\n    Adjusted for discount: 469 * 0.81 = 379.89\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since this is the last round, any counteroffer will be treated as a walk away, thus I should focus on accepting an offer that maximizes my value.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Accepting the current offer yields a discounted value of 379.89, which is greater than my outside offer of 244.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer gives me 379.89 discounted value which is greater than my outside option of 244.\n*   Since this is the last round, if I make a counteroffer the game will end with both players getting the outside offers. Thus I should accept this offer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 20 for item 1, 73 for item 2, 63 for item 3, 12 for item 4, 14 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 601. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 244. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 244. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 546 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 6, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 73 x 1 + 63 x 0 + 12 x 6 + 14 x 7\n    which is 243 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 244. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 4, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 6, 7]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 5, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 6, 7]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 4, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 4, 6]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 244\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 20\n    *   Item 2: 73\n    *   Item 3: 63\n    *   Item 4: 12\n    *   Item 5: 14\n*   **Total item pool:** 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 3, any accepted offer will be multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 4, 6].  This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 7 - 4 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 8 - 6 = 2\n\n    My value from accepting the current offer is:\n    (3 * 20) + (3 * 73) + (2 * 63) + (3 * 12) + (2 * 14) = 60 + 219 + 126 + 36 + 28 = 469\n    Adjusted for discount: 469 * 0.81 = 379.89\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since this is the last round, any counteroffer will be treated as a walk away, thus I should focus on accepting an offer that maximizes my value.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Accepting the current offer yields a discounted value of 379.89, which is greater than my outside offer of 244.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer gives me 379.89 discounted value which is greater than my outside option of 244.\n*   Since this is the last round, if I make a counteroffer the game will end with both players getting the outside offers. Thus I should accept this offer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 84 for item 1, 49 for item 2, 28 for item 3, 49 for item 4, 16 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 851. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 638. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 638. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 678 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 5, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 3 + 49 x 2 + 28 x 5 + 49 x 3 + 16 x 0\n    which is 637 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 638. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine my best course of action for round 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 638\n*   **My item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 84\n    *   Item 2: 49\n    *   Item 3: 28\n    *   Item 4: 49\n    *   Item 5: 16\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 5\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that any agreement reached in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the actual value and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the actual value. For a round 1 agreement, the multiplier is 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so my value if I accept is 0.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to create an offer that is better for me than my outside offer of 638, otherwise I will be in mistake 2.\n\nLet's try an example, keeping most of the higher value items: I keep 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5\n\nValue Calculation:\n3 units of item 1 = 3 * 84 = 252\n3 units of item 2 = 3 * 49 = 147\n3 units of item 3 = 3 * 28 = 84\n2 units of item 4 = 2 * 49 = 98\n1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 16 = 16\nTotal Value = 252 + 147 + 84 + 98 + 16 = 597\nThis value of 597 is lower than my outside offer of 638 and therefore an unacceptable offer to make.\n\nLet's try another example: I keep all units of items 1,2 and 4, one of item 3 and none of item 5.\n\nValue calculation:\n4 units of item 1 = 4 * 84 = 336\n4 units of item 2 = 4 * 49 = 196\n1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 28 = 28\n3 units of item 4 = 3 * 49 = 147\n0 unit of item 5 = 0 * 16 = 0\nTotal Value = 336 + 196 + 28 + 147 + 0 = 707. This is greater than my outside offer, which is good.\n\nThis counteroffer would mean giving 4 units of item 3, and 2 of item 5 to the other player.\nTherefore, the offer is [0,0,4,0,2].\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer since it is empty, which is a 0 value to me which is less than 638.\n*   I should not walk away since there is a possibility of getting a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n*   I should propose the counteroffer calculated in the step above, as this gives me value of 707, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]}\n```\n",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 99 for item 1, 82 for item 2, 21 for item 3, 22 for item 4, 98 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1091. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 885. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 885. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 966 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 3, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 3 + 82 x 4 + 21 x 3 + 22 x 0 + 98 x 2\n    which is 884 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 885. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 885. This is my guaranteed fallback if negotiations fail.\n*   **Item Values:** My private values are:\n    *   Item 1: 99\n    *   Item 2: 82\n    *   Item 3: 21\n    *   Item 4: 22\n    *   Item 5: 98\n*   **Total Item Pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. This means that accepting a deal in a later round is worth less than accepting the same deal in an earlier round (e.g. a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 of what it would be in round 1). This incentivizes accepting earlier, but doesn't mean you should accept a bad offer to get a deal now.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for accepting this offer is (0 * 99) + (0 * 82) + (4 * 21) + (0 * 22) + (2 * 98) = 0 + 0 + 84 + 0 + 196 = 280.\n    *   Since this is the first round, there is no discount. \n    *   This current offer is worth 280 to me.\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer (280) is significantly less than my outside offer (885). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n* **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to come up with a counteroffer that gives me more value than my outside offer, keeping in mind that I should make an offer that is not too greedy in early rounds, else the other party may walk. I will start by trying to give up as little as possible while still leaving something for Player 1.\n    *   Let's consider giving Player 1: [1, 1, 2, 1, 0]. This means I would keep [3, 3, 3, 2, 2].\n        *   My value would then be (3 * 99) + (3 * 82) + (3 * 21) + (2 * 22) + (2 * 98) = 297 + 246 + 63 + 44 + 196 = 846. This is less than the outside offer. So this is a bad offer for me.\n    *   Let's try giving player 1: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I would keep [4, 4, 4, 3, 2]\n        * My value would then be (4 * 99) + (4 * 82) + (4 * 21) + (3 * 22) + (2 * 98) = 396 + 328 + 84 + 66 + 196 = 1070. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is unacceptable because it's far below my outside offer.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that provides me with a value greater than my outside offer. Giving Player 1 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] results in a value of 1070. I will propose this as my first counteroffer.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer giving away one unit of item 3: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 84 for item 1, 49 for item 2, 28 for item 3, 49 for item 4, 16 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 851. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 638. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 638. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 678 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 5, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 3 + 49 x 2 + 28 x 5 + 49 x 3 + 16 x 0\n    which is 637 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 638. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 638\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 84\n    *   Item 2: 49\n    *   Item 3: 28\n    *   Item 4: 49\n    *   Item 5: 16\n*   **Total pool of items:** 4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 2 of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, any accepted outcome will be discounted by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 1 unit of item 3, and the remaining items (4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5).\n    My value for accepting this offer, before the discount is:\n    (4 * 84) + (4 * 49) + (4 * 28) + (3 * 49) + (2 * 16) + (1 * 28) = 336 + 196 + 112 + 147 + 32 + 28 = 851\n    Applying the discount, my value would be: 851 * 0.9 = 765.9\n*   **Counteroffer Considerations:** I need to propose a counteroffer that provides a value of more than 638 * 1/0.9 = 708.89 to make it a better outcome, if I accepted it this round, to walking. Any offer that results in the value after a discount to be greater than 638 would be a more advantageous outcome than just walking away.\n    *   Mistake 2: My counteroffer should result in a value of more than 638 after it has been discounted by 0.9.\n    *  Mistake 1: My counteroffer should not be worse than my previous offer. My last offer was [0,0,4,0,2] which had a discounted value of 851 * .9 = 765.9 for me. This is better than my outside offer of 638.\n\nLet's consider some potential counteroffers:\nIf I offer [0,0,0,0,0], I keep everything and my value is 851 * .9 = 765.9\nIf I offer [1,1,1,1,1] to Player 2, I keep [3,3,4,2,1] and my value is (3 * 84) + (3 * 49) + (4 * 28) + (2 * 49) + (1 * 16) = 252 + 147 + 112 + 98 + 16 = 625. 625 * 0.9 = 562.5 This is lower than the outside offer. This would be Mistake 2\nIf I offer [1,1,0,1,0], I keep [3,3,5,2,2] and my value is (3 * 84) + (3 * 49) + (5 * 28) + (2 * 49) + (2 * 16) = 252 + 147 + 140 + 98 + 32 = 669. 669 * 0.9 = 602.1. This is less than my outside offer. This would be Mistake 2\nIf I offer [0,0,1,0,0], I keep [4,4,4,3,2] and my value is 851. 851 * 0.9 = 765.9.\nIf I offer [0,0,2,0,0], I keep [4,4,3,3,2] and my value is 851 - 56 = 795. 795 * .9 = 715.5\nIf I offer [0,0,3,0,0], I keep [4,4,2,3,2] and my value is 851 - 84 = 767. 767 * .9 = 690.3.\nIf I offer [0,0,0,0,1], I keep [4,4,5,3,1] and my value is 851 - 16 = 835. 835 * .9 = 751.5\nIf I offer [0,0,0,1,0], I keep [4,4,5,2,2] and my value is 851 - 49 = 802. 802 * .9 = 721.8\nIf I offer [1,0,0,0,0] I keep [3,4,5,3,2] and my value is 851-84= 767. 767 * 0.9 = 690.3\nIf I offer [0,1,0,0,0] I keep [4,3,5,3,2] and my value is 851-49= 802. 802 * 0.9 = 721.8\nIf I offer [2,0,0,0,0] I keep [2,4,5,3,2] and my value is 851 - 168 = 683. 683 * 0.9 = 614.7. This is lower than outside.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer from Player 2 is [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. If I accept, my total value would be 765.9, which is better than my outside offer of 638. \nMy previous offer was [0,0,4,0,2]. Any counteroffer that is significantly different may signal a poor strategy to the opposing agent.\nGiven that the current offer of [0,0,1,0,0] is better than my outside offer, and I have already tried to extract additional items, the best course of action here is to accept the current offer of [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] from Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```\n",
