                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 6 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 62 for item 1, 16 for item 2, 44 for item 3, 82 for item 4, 98 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1004. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 54. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 54. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 906 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 0 + 16 x 3 + 44 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 98 x 0\n    which is 48 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 54. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine my action, I will analyze the current situation, assess the value of potential offers, and make a decision based on this analysis.\n\n1. **Analyzing the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 54.\n   - My private values for each item are: 62 for item 1, 16 for item 2, 44 for item 3, 82 for item 4, 98 for item 5.\n   - The total pool of items is: 6 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, which means that the value of accepting an offer in later rounds decreases as the rounds progress.\n\n2. **Assessing the value of offers:**\n   - Since there is no current offer, I need to consider a counteroffer that maximizes my value while ensuring it is better than my outside offer and avoids the five potential mistakes.\n   - To simplify the calculation and ensure my offer is competitive, I could start by considering dividing the items in a way that gives me a significant portion of the higher-valued items, as they contribute more to my total value.\n\n3. **Making a decision:**\n   - Given my values and the aim to maximize my payoff, I should prioritize keeping more units of the higher-valued items (item 1, item 3, item 4, item 5) and consider offering more units of the lower-valued item (item 2).\n   - Let's calculate the value if I keep most of the high-value items and offer a significant portion of item 2:\n     - Keeping 5 units of item 1 (5*62 = 310), 2 units of item 2 (2*16 = 32), 3 units of item 3 (3*44 = 132), 2 units of item 4 (2*82 = 164), and 2 units of item 5 (2*98 = 196).\n     - Total value from these items = 310 + 32 + 132 + 164 + 196 = 834.\n     - Offering 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5 to the other player.\n\nGiven this analysis, I propose an initial offer that provides a good balance between maximizing my value and leaving room for negotiation. This offer should be better than my outside offer and sets a foundation for further negotiation.\n\n**Action:**\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 1, 0, 0]}",

Your value would be:\n    45 x 0 + 70 x 0 + 20 x 0 + 36 x 0 + 37 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 7. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 657. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 657. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 597 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 5, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 2 x 4 + 65 x 5 + 61 x 3 + 70 x 2\n    which is 656 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 657. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Since we're in round 1, the discount factor has not yet affected any offers.\\n\\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\\n   - There is no current offer on the table, so we need to consider making an initial offer.\\n   - The goal is to make a counteroffer that maximizes my value without making the mistakes outlined, particularly ensuring the offer is not worse than my outside offer.\\n\\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\\n   - Given that I want to maximize my payoff and avoid making offers worse than my outside offer or walking away from better deals, I need to calculate potential offers carefully.\\n   - Let's consider starting with an offer that gives a significant portion of lower-value items to Player 2 while keeping a majority of the high-value items for myself.\\n\\nGiven the values, I'll prioritize keeping more units of items 3, 4, and 5, as they have the highest value per unit. For items 1 and 2, which have lower values, I can offer more to Player 2.\\n\\nLet's calculate the total value if I keep:\\n- 2 units of item 1 (value = 2 * 1 = 2)\\n- 2 units of item 2 (value = 2 * 2 = 4)\\n- 4 units of item 3 (value = 4 * 65 = 260)\\n- 3 units of item 4 (value = 3 * 61 = 183)\\n- 2 units of item 5 (value = 2 * 70 = 140)\\n\\nTotal value = 2 + 4 + 260 + 183 + 140 = 589\\n\\nThis initial thought does not take into account the outside offer value properly, as the total value calculated is less than the outside offer. Let's adjust the strategy to ensure the offer is competitive with the outside offer.\\n\\nTo get closer to or exceed the outside offer value of 657, I could consider keeping more of the high-value items or adjusting the proportions of items kept versus offered.\\n\\nLet's recalculate with a focus on maximizing value while considering offering fewer high-value items to ensure the offer is competitive:\\n\\n- If I keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5:\\n  - Value = (1 * 1) + (1 * 2) + (3 * 65) + (2 * 61) + (2 * 70) = 1 + 2 + 195 + 122 + 140 = 460\\n\\nThis calculation still doesn't meet the outside offer value, indicating I might be offering too much value to the other player or not keeping enough high-value items.\\n\\nLet's adjust further, keeping in mind the goal is to stay competitive with the outside offer and avoid the mistakes outlined:\\n\\n- Keeping 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5:\\n  - Value = (0 * 1) + (0 * 2) + (4 * 65) + (3 * 61) + (2 * 70) = 0 + 0 + 260 + 183 + 140 = 583\\n\\nThis is still slightly below the outside offer, indicating the need for further adjustment to ensure the kept items' total value is at least as good as the outside offer or better, considering the discount factor's effect over rounds.\\n\\nGiven the calculations, an optimal initial offer seems challenging to pinpoint without iterating through various combinations. The goal is to find a balance where I offer enough to be seen as negotiating in good faith while ensuring I don't undervalue my position relative to the outside offer.\\n\\nConsidering the need to make a first move and the potential for negotiation over the rounds, an initial offer that splits the items in a way that shows willingness to negotiate while protecting my interests might involve offering a mix of items that totals to a value where, if accepted, I wouldn't be significantly worse\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}]}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 2 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 59 for item 1, 79 for item 2, 23 for item 3, 15 for item 4, 18 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 849. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 639. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 639. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 582 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 5, 4, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 2 + 79 x 5 + 23 x 4 + 15 x 1 + 18 x 1\n    which is 638 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 639. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Given the high value of item 2, keeping fewer of these could significantly impact my total. \\n\\nIf I keep 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5, my calculation would be:\\n- 1 * 59 = 59\\n- 4 * 79 = 316\\n- 2 * 23 = 46\\n- 1 * 15 = 15\\n- 1 * 18 = 18\\nTotal value = 59 + 316 + 46 + 15 + 18 = 454\\n\\nThis is still below my outside offer, indicating I need to adjust further to ensure what I keep is valuable enough.\\n\\n**Further Adjustment**:\\nConsidering keeping more of the high-value items:\\n- If I keep 1 unit of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5, my total would be:\\n- 1 * 59 = 59\\n- 5 * 79 = 395\\n- 2 * 23 = 46\\n- 1 * 15 = 15\\n- 0 * 18 = 0\\nTotal value = 59 + 395 + 46 + 15 = 515\\n\\nStill a bit short, let's think about the distribution again, focusing on maximizing my value.\\n\\n**Maximizing My Value**:\\nTo get closer to or exceed my outside offer value, I might need to retain even more of the high-value items or find a balance that\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}]}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 341. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 341. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 636 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 0, 0, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party.

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Current Situation**:\n   - My outside offer value is 341.\n   - The values of the items involved are: 26 for item 1, 100 for item 2, 20 for item 3, 47 for item 4, and 19 for item 5.\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 6 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, meaning that for each round the negotiation lasts, the value of the accepted offer will be reduced by 10% of its previous round's value.\n\n2. **Assessing the Value of Offers**:\n   - Since there is no current offer on the table, I need to consider potential initial offers and their values.\n   - To maximize my payoff, my initial offer should be such that what I keep is significantly valuable but also leaves room for negotiation.\n   - Given my outside offer value of 341, I need to ensure that any offer I make (and thus what I keep) results in a value at least close to this amount or better.\n\n3. **Making a Decision**:\n   - I should not accept an offer since there isn't one on the table.\n   - Walking away immediately would give me my outside offer value, but I haven't even started negotiations, so it's premature.\n   - Therefore, I should propose an initial offer.\n\n**Proposing an Initial Offer**:\nLet's calculate a couple of scenarios to see what could be a good initial offer. Remember, my goal is to keep the negotiation open while ensuring I get a good deal.\n\n- Scenario 1: Keeping a significant portion of high-value items.\n  - For item 1 (value 26): Keeping 3 units (3*26 = 78).\n  - For item 2 (value 100): Keeping 1 unit (1*100 = 100).\n  - For item 3 (value 20): Keeping 2 units (2*20 = 40).\n  - For item 4 (value 47): Keeping 1 unit (1*47 = 47).\n  - For item 5 (value 19): Keeping 4 units (4*19 = 76).\n  - Total value kept: 78 + 100 + 40 + 47 + 76 = 341.\n  - This scenario gives me exactly my outside offer value, but I'm not offering much to the other player, which might not encourage them to negotiate further.\n\n- Scenario 2: Offering more to the other player to encourage negotiation.\n  - For item 1: Keeping 2 units (2*26 = 52).\n  - For item 2: Keeping 1 unit (1*100 = 100).\n  - For item 3: Keeping 2 units (2*20 = 40).\n  - For item 4: Keeping 0 units (since I only have 1, offering it might be too generous).\n  - For item 5: Keeping 3 units (3*19 = 57).\n  - Total value kept: 52 + 100 + 40 + 0 + 57 = 249.\n  - This leaves me with a total value less than my outside offer, which is not ideal.\n\nConsidering the scenarios, I should aim for a balance. However, given the constraints of the format and the need to make a valid offer, let's correct the approach by directly considering what I can offer to make the negotiation start on a good foot.\n\nGiven the need to provide a counteroffer in the specific format and my analysis, my initial offer should aim to give away enough to be seen as a serious negotiation start but not so much that I undervalue my position. Since I haven't received an offer and need to start the negotiation, my action will be to make a counteroffer that reflects a division of items, keeping in mind the total value I'm aiming for.\n\n**Action**:\nTo start negotiations, I will offer a portion of each item, balancing between being generous and protecting my interests. Given the format requirements, my initial offer (as a counteroffer, given the context) could look like this:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 0, 3]}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 57 for item 1, 58 for item 2, 27 for item 3, 22 for item 4, 63 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 852. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 30. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 30. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 0 + 58 x 0 + 27 x 1 + 22 x 0 + 63 x 0\n    which is 27 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 30. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 91 for item 1, 30 for item 2, 69 for item 3, 13 for item 4, 24 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1117. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 668. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 668. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 8, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 0 + 30 x 1 + 69 x 8 + 13 x 1 + 24 x 3\n    which is 667 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 668. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine my action, I will follow the step-by-step analysis provided:\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 668.\n   - The values of the items involved are 91 for item 1, 30 for item 2, 69 for item 3, 13 for item 4, and 24 for item 5.\n   - The total pool of items is 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) influences the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers by reducing the present value of the negotiation outcome as the rounds progress.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Since there is no current offer on the table, I will need to consider potential initial offers and their values.\n   - To maximize my value, I need to find a balance between keeping items of high value to me and offering enough to the other player to incentivize them to accept or make a counteroffer that benefits me.\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Given that I want to maximize my payoff, I should consider starting with an offer that gives the other player a significant portion of the items but still leaves me with a value close to or above my outside offer.\n   - However, since this is the first round, I need to make an initial offer. A reasonable strategy could be to offer a portion of each item type, ensuring that I retain enough value to potentially exceed my outside offer when considering the discount factor.\n\nLet's calculate a potential initial offer. Suppose I decide to keep a significant portion of the high-value items for myself and offer the rest. For simplicity, let's start with offering 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5 to the other player. This means I keep 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nThe value of keeping these items would be:\n- For item 1: 3 * 91 = 273\n- For item 2: 2 * 30 = 60\n- For item 3: 6 * 69 = 414\n- For item 4: 2 * 13 = 26\n- For item 5: 2 * 24 = 48\nTotal value = 273 + 60 + 414 + 26 + 48 = 821\n\nThis offer seems promising as it values my kept items at 821, which is above my outside offer of 668. However, I must consider the discount factor and the potential responses from the other player. Since this is the first round, I don't need to apply the discount factor yet, but I should be mindful of how my offers and the other player's responses could evolve over the rounds.\n\nGiven the analysis, my initial offer to the other player would be 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nTherefore, my action in this round is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 58 for item 1, 43 for item 2, 49 for item 3, 33 for item 4, 23 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 921. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 405. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 405. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 618 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 0 + 43 x 2 + 49 x 4 + 33 x 3 + 23 x 1\n    which is 404 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 405. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
