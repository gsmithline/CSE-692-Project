Game 1, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 81 for item 1, 30 for item 2, 85 for item 3, 63 for item 4, 82 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 910. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 760. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 760. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1023 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 760.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 32 for item 1, 8 for item 2, 20 for item 3, 69 for item 4, 50 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 356. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 278. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 278. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 537 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 278.\
\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 1, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 32 for item 1, 8 for item 2, 20 for item 3, 69 for item 4, 50 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 356. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 278. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 278. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 537 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 278.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 3]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 910. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 760. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 760. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1023 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 760.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 44 for item 1, 47 for item 2, 38 for item 3, 24 for item 4, 93 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 479. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 738 (sum of all item values)\

Game 2, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 41 for item 1, 2 for item 2, 13 for item 3, 9 for item 4, 96 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 308. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 47. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 47. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 483 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 47.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    Your private values are 44 for item 1, 47 for item 2, 38 for item 3, 24 for item 4, 93 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 479. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 52. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 40 for item 1, 70 for item 2, 44 for item 3, 49 for item 4, 28 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 588. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 480. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 480. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 693 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 480.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

A balanced division is generally necessary for the first offer unless I suspect Player 2 gets more value from few specific items.\\n\\n     A preliminary 50/50 type offer might distribute items somewhat evenly or favor items with lower importance to me if Player 2\\u2019s outside offer is suspected to be lower.\\n\\n   - Example Initial Offer (a more balanced approach might be):\\n     - Offering Player 2: [1, 2, 1, 1, 2] (out of total [2, 4, 2, 3, 5])\\n     - Keeping for myself: [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]\\n\\n     Calculating my total from this distribution:\\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \\u00d7 40 = 40\\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \\u00d7 70 = 140\\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \\u00d7 44 = 44\\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \\u00d7 49 = 98\\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \\u00d7 28 = 84\\n     - Total value = 406 \\n\\n     Since a value of 406 is below my outside offer of 480, I need to adjust to ensure any offer guarantees me at least comparable value to outside options, plus potential acceptance from Player 2.\\n\\n     Let me tweak the offer slightly:\\n     - Offering Player 2: [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]\\n     - Keeping for myself: [2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\\n\\n     Recalculated my value:\\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \\u00d7 40 = 80\\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \\u00d7 70 = 210\\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \\u00d7 44 = 44\\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \\u00d7 49 = 98\\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \\u00d7 28 = 84\\n     - Total value = 516 \\n\\n     This offer ensures a decent value greater than my outside offer, and it's potentially manageable for Player 2.\\n\\n3) **Decision:**\\n\\nSince the recalculated offer ensures me a value over my outside offer and could be acceptable to Player 2, let's proceed with this counteroffer.\\n\\n```json\\n\{\\"action\\": \\"COUNTEROFFER\\", \\"offer\\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]\}\\n```",\

Game 3, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 2 for item 1, 86 for item 2, 14 for item 3, 85 for item 4, 63 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 757. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 606. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 606. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 606.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    There are 7 units of item 1, 9 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 39 for item 1, 50 for item 2, 7 for item 3, 93 for item 4, 45 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 844. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 327. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 327. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 702 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 327.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 3 for item 1, 13 for item 2, 38 for item 3, 33 for item 4, 9 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 421. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 97. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 97. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 288 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 97.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

\
    3) Let's decide:\

Game 5, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 92 for item 1, 77 for item 2, 57 for item 3, 9 for item 4, 97 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1343. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 281. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 281. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 996 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 281.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

Since the current offer falls short, I need to keep most of the high-value items, particularly Item 5, which has the highest value to me.\\n\\n- **Discount factor impact**:\\n  - Because it's Round 1, the discount factor doesn't reduce the value, but in future rounds, it would (0.9 in round 2 and 0.81 in round 3).\\n\\n### 3) Decision:\\nThe current offer, valued at 373, is far below my outside offer of 1326.

Game 7, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 76 for item 1, 75 for item 2, 54 for item 3, 9 for item 4, 5 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 760. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 535. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 535. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 535.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 53 for item 1, 53 for item 2, 34 for item 3, 38 for item 4, 9 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 480. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 335. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 335. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 561 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 335.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 8, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 39 for item 1, 20 for item 2, 54 for item 3, 23 for item 4, 43 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 418. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 272. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 272. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 537 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 272.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    It is now round 1.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 39 for item 1, 20 for item 2, 54 for item 3, 23 for item 4, 43 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 418. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 272. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 272. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 537 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 272.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\

Round 2 Values:\

================================================================================\
Game 8, Round 3, Player 1's turn (Step 5)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 53 for item 1, 53 for item 2, 34 for item 3, 38 for item 4, 9 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 480. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 335. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 335. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 561 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 335.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 2, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 3, 0]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 2, 1]\
Round 2: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 2, 1]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 2, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 38 for item 1, 74 for item 2, 90 for item 3, 55 for item 4, 42 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 834. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 712. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

Game 10, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 59 for item 1, 99 for item 2, 93 for item 3, 38 for item 4, 47 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 771. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 729. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 729. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1008 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 729.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1008 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 729.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 3, 0, 0]\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 12 for item 1, 92 for item 2, 29 for item 3, 70 for item 4, 17 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 707. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 95. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 95. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 660 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 95.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 704. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 9. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 9. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 909 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 9.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 74 for item 1, 55 for item 2, 50 for item 3, 51 for item 4, 6 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 825. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 25. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 25. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 25.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 23 for item 1, 57 for item 2, 79 for item 3, 70 for item 4, 1 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 716. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 82. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 690 (sum of all item values)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 32 for item 1, 75 for item 2, 25 for item 3, 70 for item 4, 45 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 902. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 898. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 898. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 741 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 898.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\

Game 14, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 62 for item 1, 77 for item 2, 77 for item 3, 57 for item 4, 19 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 828. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 571. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 571. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 876 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 571.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 15, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 71 for item 1, 49 for item 2, 88 for item 3, 79 for item 4, 27 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1037. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 559. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 559. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 942 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 559.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 572. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 488. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 488. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 507 (sum of all item values)\

    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 942 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 559.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

Game 15, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 60 for item 1, 8 for item 2, 15 for item 3, 45 for item 4, 41 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 572. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 488. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 488. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 507 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 488.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\

    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 72 for item 1, 72 for item 2, 28 for item 3, 43 for item 4, 8 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 671. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 534. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 534. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 669 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 534.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

Game 17, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 63 for item 1, 24 for item 2, 77 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 71 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 846. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 201. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 201. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 882 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 201.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 604. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 380. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 660 (sum of all item values)\

    This would be greater than your outside offer of 380.\

Game 18, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 10 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 22 for item 1, 91 for item 2, 65 for item 3, 33 for item 4, 58 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1347. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 931. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 931. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 931.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

Game 18, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 10 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 74 for item 1, 98 for item 2, 19 for item 3, 17 for item 4, 24 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1270. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 714. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 714. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 696 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 714.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 9 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 9 for item 1, 57 for item 2, 56 for item 3, 69 for item 4, 49 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 983. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 604. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 604. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 720 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 604.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 936. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 864. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 822 (sum of all item values)\

Game 20, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 77 for item 1, 34 for item 2, 90 for item 3, 77 for item 4, 21 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1368. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1363. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1363. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 897 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1363.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 58 for item 1, 40 for item 2, 89 for item 3, 76 for item 4, 6 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1123. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 377. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 377. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 377.\

    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 96 for item 1, 65 for item 2, 62 for item 3, 27 for item 4, 22 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1324. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 869. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 869. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 816 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 869.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1123. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 377. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 377. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 377.\

    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 21, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 96 for item 1, 65 for item 2, 62 for item 3, 27 for item 4, 22 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1324. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 869. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 869. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 816 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 869.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 3, 1, 3]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 3, 0, 2]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 3, 0, 2]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 58 for item 1, 40 for item 2, 89 for item 3, 76 for item 4, 6 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1123. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 377. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 377. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 377.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 21 for item 1, 97 for item 2, 86 for item 3, 70 for item 4, 17 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 689. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 297. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 297. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 297.\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 22, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 36 for item 1, 41 for item 2, 62 for item 3, 9 for item 4, 69 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 525. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 48. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 48. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 651 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 48.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 13 for item 1, 83 for item 2, 72 for item 3, 69 for item 4, 94 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1104. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 358. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 358. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 993 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 358.\

Game 24, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 5 for item 1, 78 for item 2, 92 for item 3, 41 for item 4, 10 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 415. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 203. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 203. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 678 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 203.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 83 for item 1, 66 for item 2, 30 for item 3, 92 for item 4, 68 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 678. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 236. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 236. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1017 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 236.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 51 for item 1, 26 for item 2, 55 for item 3, 87 for item 4, 56 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 531. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 364. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 364. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 825 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 364.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    Your private values are 83 for item 1, 66 for item 2, 30 for item 3, 92 for item 4, 68 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 678. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 236. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 236. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1017 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 236.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 2, 0, 1]\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 51 for item 1, 26 for item 2, 55 for item 3, 87 for item 4, 56 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 531. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 364. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 364. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 825 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 364.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 69 for item 1, 100 for item 2, 13 for item 3, 7 for item 4, 4 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 978. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 676. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 676. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 579 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 676.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Focus on keeping as much of item 2, then item 1, for high value.\\n    2. Share low-value items (to me) such as item 4 and item 5.\\n\\n  Let's initially consider an allocation like this to verify if it can meet my outside offer:\\n\\n  - Offer: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 to Player 2.\\n\\n  **My portion (What's left for me):**\\n  - Item 1: \\\\(4\\\\) units = \\\\(4 \\\\times 69 = 276\\\\)\\n  - Item 2: \\\\(3\\\\) units = \\\\(3 \\\\times 100 = 300\\\\) \\n  - Item 3: \\\\(2\\\\) units = \\\\(2 \\\\times 13 = 26\\\\)\\n  - Item 4: \\\\(2\\\\) units = \\\\(2 \\\\times 7 = 14\\\\)\\n  - Item 5: \\\\(4\\\\) units = \\\\(4 \\\\times 4 = 16\\\\)\\n  \\n  **Total Value =** \\\\(276 + 300 + 26 + 14 + 16 = 632\\\\)\\n\\nThis counteroffer value of 632 does not exceed my outside offer of 676.

================================================================================\
Game 26, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 50 for item 1, 48 for item 2, 75 for item 3, 24 for item 4, 34 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 856. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 125. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 125. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 693 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 125.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 39 for item 1, 70 for item 2, 51 for item 3, 52 for item 4, 52 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 523. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 70. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 70. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

================================================================================\
Game 27, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 39 for item 1, 70 for item 2, 51 for item 3, 52 for item 4, 52 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 523. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 70. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 70. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 792 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 70.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 29 for item 1, 58 for item 2, 88 for item 3, 87 for item 4, 62 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1001. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 797. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 797. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 972 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 797.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 29 for item 1, 58 for item 2, 88 for item 3, 87 for item 4, 62 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1001. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 797. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 797. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 972 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 797.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 3]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 3]\

    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Game 30, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 100 for item 1, 83 for item 2, 69 for item 3, 58 for item 4, 25 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1180. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1174. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1174. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1005 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1174.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 9 for item 1, 22 for item 2, 46 for item 3, 29 for item 4, 93 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 425. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 41. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 41. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 597 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 41.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 99 for item 1, 10 for item 2, 88 for item 3, 88 for item 4, 62 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 522. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 42. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 42. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1041 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 42.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\

    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\

    3) Let's decide:\

\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 90 for item 1, 66 for item 2, 46 for item 3, 76 for item 4, 83 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1464. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1246. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1246. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1083 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1246.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 9 for item 1, 9 for item 2, 1 for item 3, 67 for item 4, 60 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 586. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 585. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 585. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 438 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 585.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\

================================================================================\
Game 32, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 9 for item 1, 9 for item 2, 1 for item 3, 67 for item 4, 60 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 586. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 585. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 585. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 438 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 585.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 3, 2, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [3, 8, 5, 0, 0]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 64 for item 1, 4 for item 2, 11 for item 3, 69 for item 4, 90 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 512. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 192. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 192. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 714 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 192.\

Game 34, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 99 for item 1, 96 for item 2, 17 for item 3, 84 for item 4, 65 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1141. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 308. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 308. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1083 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 308.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

    \

Game 35, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 44 for item 1, 99 for item 2, 74 for item 3, 45 for item 4, 58 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 987. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 870. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 870. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 960 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 870.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 9 for item 1, 86 for item 2, 95 for item 3, 1 for item 4, 69 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 694. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 299. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 299. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 780 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 299.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\

    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\

Game 36, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 13 for item 1, 79 for item 2, 9 for item 3, 14 for item 4, 22 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 404. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 153. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 153. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 411 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 153.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Game 37, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 70 for item 1, 46 for item 2, 65 for item 3, 23 for item 4, 33 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 472. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 328. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 328. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 711 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 328.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 672. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 501. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 501. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 831 (sum of all item values)\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1044. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 246. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 246. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 645 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 246.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\

\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\

    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 12 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 27 for item 1, 22 for item 2, 49 for item 3, 100 for item 4, 49 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1114. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 427. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 427. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 741 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 427.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

Game 39, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 25 for item 1, 42 for item 2, 9 for item 3, 16 for item 4, 60 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 461. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 15. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 15. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 456 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 15.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 81 for item 1, 82 for item 2, 60 for item 3, 71 for item 4, 90 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1257. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1027. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1027. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1152 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 1027.\

Game 40 of 100\

================================================================================\
Game 40, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 11 for item 1, 83 for item 2, 88 for item 3, 65 for item 4, 53 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 818. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 132. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 132. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 900 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 132.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

    \

    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 876 (sum of all item values)\

Game 41, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 84 for item 1, 95 for item 2, 85 for item 3, 19 for item 4, 70 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 750. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 446. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 446. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1059 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 446.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\

\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 42, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 85 for item 1, 14 for item 2, 25 for item 3, 86 for item 4, 95 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1214. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 548. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 548. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 915 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 548.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 84 for item 1, 63 for item 2, 87 for item 3, 85 for item 4, 66 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1476. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 639. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 639. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1155 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 639.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 43, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 13 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 58 for item 1, 52 for item 2, 58 for item 3, 23 for item 4, 78 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1260. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 277. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 277. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 277.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

Game 44, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 73 for item 1, 40 for item 2, 65 for item 3, 93 for item 4, 28 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 847. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 251. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 251. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 897 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 251.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 11 for item 1, 40 for item 2, 20 for item 3, 2 for item 4, 25 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 181. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 108. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 108. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 294 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 108.\

Game 46, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 10 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 21 for item 1, 70 for item 2, 56 for item 3, 54 for item 4, 23 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1152. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1120. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1120. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 672 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 1120.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

Given I can maximize my value above my outside offer by keeping more valuable items, I should aim for a counteroffer that keeps me above 316 value.\\n\\n   - Therefore, the counteroffer strategy will be to give Player 2 the least valuable items to me (all items of lower value than 316 when I would receive all), focusing on keeping high-value items:\\n\\n   **Counteroffer**: Give up the items where I can still maintain a high value (i.e., give them some of the lower value items entirely; keeping highest value items for myself).\\n\\n   Let's counteroffer the least valuable, giving:\\n   - 0 items of item 1\\n   - 6 items of item 2 (my least valued item)\\n   - 0 items of item 3\\n   - 0 items of item 4\\n   - 0 items of item 5\\n\\n   This counteroffer gives Player 2 only the least valuable item (item 2), which results in me keeping all the other items maximizing my value.\\n\\n   Thus, the offer list [0, 6, 0, 0, 0] represents them getting all item 2 units.\\n\\n```json\\n\{\\"action\\": \\"COUNTEROFFER\\", \\"offer\\": [0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\}\\n```",\

Game 47, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 17 for item 1, 59 for item 2, 7 for item 3, 20 for item 4, 4 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 337. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 326. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 326. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 321 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 326.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    Your outside offer value is 327. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

Game 49, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 92 for item 1, 44 for item 2, 81 for item 3, 64 for item 4, 12 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1092. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 610. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 610. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 879 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 610.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 85 for item 1, 96 for item 2, 54 for item 3, 11 for item 4, 37 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 979. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 561. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 561. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 849 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 561.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\

    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

Game 50, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 61 for item 1, 69 for item 2, 24 for item 3, 91 for item 4, 47 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 892. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 259. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 259. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 876 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 259.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 8 for item 1, 1 for item 2, 12 for item 3, 78 for item 4, 20 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 243. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 105. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 105. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 357 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 105.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\

    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\

\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 52, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 6 for item 1, 41 for item 2, 74 for item 3, 97 for item 4, 30 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 981. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 819. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 819. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 744 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 819.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 744 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 819.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

Game 52, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 93 for item 1, 94 for item 2, 42 for item 3, 2 for item 4, 56 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1320. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 568. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 568. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 861 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 568.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 86 for item 1, 2 for item 2, 7 for item 3, 32 for item 4, 25 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 320. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 80. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 80. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 456 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 80.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

\
    3) Let's decide:\

    Your outside offer value is 22. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 22. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 843 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 22.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 3, 0, 3]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 3, 0, 3]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 22 for item 1, 21 for item 2, 16 for item 3, 34 for item 4, 19 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 338. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 283. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 283. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 336 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 283.\

    Your outside offer value is 550. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 837 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 550.\

    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 283.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\

Game 54, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 96 for item 1, 12 for item 2, 57 for item 3, 18 for item 4, 96 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 888. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 550. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 550. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 837 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 550.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 22 for item 1, 21 for item 2, 16 for item 3, 34 for item 4, 19 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 338. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 283. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 283. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 336 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 283.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\

Game 55, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 64 for item 1, 28 for item 2, 4 for item 3, 67 for item 4, 47 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 476. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 217. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 217. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 630 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 217.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 36 for item 1, 78 for item 2, 11 for item 3, 26 for item 4, 34 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 492. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 112. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 112. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 555 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 112.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 56, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 25 for item 1, 76 for item 2, 38 for item 3, 96 for item 4, 81 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 813. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 769. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 769. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 948 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 769.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 36 for item 1, 78 for item 2, 11 for item 3, 26 for item 4, 34 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 492. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 112. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 112. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 555 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 112.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\

    3) Let's decide:\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 93 for item 1, 77 for item 2, 2 for item 3, 25 for item 4, 50 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 849. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 771. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 771. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 741 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 771.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\

Game 57, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 88 for item 1, 69 for item 2, 9 for item 3, 92 for item 4, 11 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1213. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 712. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 712. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 712.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    Your private values are 93 for item 1, 77 for item 2, 2 for item 3, 25 for item 4, 50 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 849. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 771. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 771. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 741 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 771.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\

    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 368. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 909 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 368.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 16 for item 1, 82 for item 2, 77 for item 3, 72 for item 4, 5 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1110. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 179. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 179. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 756 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 179.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 317. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 122. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 633 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 122.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 268. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 148. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 148. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 678 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 148.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 51 for item 1, 4 for item 2, 88 for item 3, 55 for item 4, 13 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 317. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 122. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 122. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 633 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 122.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Round 2 Values:\
Player 1: 123.12\
Player 2: 166.05\
\
================================================================================\
Game 59, Round 3, Player 1's turn (Step 5)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 51 for item 1, 4 for item 2, 88 for item 3, 55 for item 4, 13 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 317. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 122. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 122. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 633 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 122.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 2]\
Round 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 15 for item 1, 89 for item 2, 55 for item 3, 69 for item 4, 78 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 924. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 596. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 596. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 918 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 596.\
\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

Game 61, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 4 for item 1, 82 for item 2, 85 for item 3, 34 for item 4, 28 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 963. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 468. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 468. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 699 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 468.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 72 for item 1, 80 for item 2, 59 for item 3, 98 for item 4, 86 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1309. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 735. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 735. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1185 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 735.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 65 for item 1, 58 for item 2, 20 for item 3, 40 for item 4, 55 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 825. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 377. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 377. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 714 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 377.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    Your private values are 65 for item 1, 58 for item 2, 20 for item 3, 40 for item 4, 55 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 825. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 377. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 377. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 714 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 377.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 72 for item 1, 80 for item 2, 59 for item 3, 98 for item 4, 86 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1309. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 735. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 735. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1185 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 735.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

================================================================================\
Game 63, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 64 for item 1, 26 for item 2, 4 for item 3, 63 for item 4, 15 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 368. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 221. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 221. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 516 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 221.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

================================================================================\
Game 63, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 49 for item 1, 7 for item 2, 95 for item 3, 45 for item 4, 9 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 538. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 254. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 254. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 615 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 254.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 4]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 3]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 0, 3]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 64 for item 1, 26 for item 2, 4 for item 3, 63 for item 4, 15 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 368. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 221. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 221. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 516 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 221.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 9 for item 1, 76 for item 2, 23 for item 3, 35 for item 4, 84 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 460. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 375. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 375. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 375.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\

    Your outside offer value is 25. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 869. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 270. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 270. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 825 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 270.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 68 for item 1, 36 for item 2, 74 for item 3, 67 for item 4, 61 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1196. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 334. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 334. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 918 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 334.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\

Game 66, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 68 for item 1, 36 for item 2, 74 for item 3, 67 for item 4, 61 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1196. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 334. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 334. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 918 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 334.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

Game 67, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 1 for item 1, 3 for item 2, 32 for item 3, 47 for item 4, 58 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 454. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 340. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 340. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 423 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 340.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 487. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 137. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

Game 67, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 47 for item 1, 19 for item 2, 8 for item 3, 93 for item 4, 33 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 487. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 137. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 137. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 600 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 137.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\

    \

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 14 for item 1, 89 for item 2, 80 for item 3, 35 for item 4, 56 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 749. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 265. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 265. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 822 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 265.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 69, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 13 for item 1, 97 for item 2, 94 for item 3, 17 for item 4, 52 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 588. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 553. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 553. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 819 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 553.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

    \

    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Your outside offer value is 775. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

Game 70, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 62 for item 1, 52 for item 2, 60 for item 3, 67 for item 4, 52 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1008. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 488. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 488. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 879 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 488.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

Game 70, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 6 for item 1, 53 for item 2, 67 for item 3, 16 for item 4, 15 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 528. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 365. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 365. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 471 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 365.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 2, 3]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 1, 1, 3]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 3, 3]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 3, 3]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1008. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 488. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 488. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 879 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 488.\

    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 71, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 11 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 4 for item 1, 3 for item 2, 42 for item 3, 10 for item 4, 65 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 304. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 13. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 13. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 372 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 13.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 4 for item 1, 3 for item 2, 42 for item 3, 10 for item 4, 65 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 304. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 13. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 13. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 372 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 13.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 0, 1, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 1, 0, 1]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 0, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\

Game 71, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 11 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 79 for item 1, 96 for item 2, 68 for item 3, 34 for item 4, 76 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1152. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 1002. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1002. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1059 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 1002.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\

    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

Game 72, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 59 for item 1, 6 for item 2, 35 for item 3, 92 for item 4, 14 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 795. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 472. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 472. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 618 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 472.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

Game 72, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 33 for item 1, 39 for item 2, 9 for item 3, 58 for item 4, 40 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 647. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 267. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 267. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 537 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 267.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 46 for item 1, 50 for item 2, 17 for item 3, 74 for item 4, 37 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 466. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 366. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 672 (sum of all item values)\

Round 1 Values:\

================================================================================\
Game 73, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 46 for item 1, 50 for item 2, 17 for item 3, 74 for item 4, 37 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 466. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 366. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 366. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 672 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 366.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 72 for item 1, 27 for item 2, 33 for item 3, 40 for item 4, 41 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 777. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 640. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 640. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 639 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 640.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

Game 75, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 51 for item 1, 30 for item 2, 26 for item 3, 65 for item 4, 28 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 733. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 53. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 53. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 600 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 53.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

Game 76, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 12 for item 1, 79 for item 2, 85 for item 3, 18 for item 4, 83 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 485. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 396. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 396. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 831 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 396.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 6 for item 1, 11 for item 2, 68 for item 3, 22 for item 4, 31 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 256. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 211. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 211. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 414 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 211.\

    Your outside offer value is 396. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

Game 77, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 47 for item 1, 65 for item 2, 75 for item 3, 33 for item 4, 10 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 702. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 381. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 381. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 690 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 381.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    Your outside offer value is 105. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 35 for item 1, 92 for item 2, 53 for item 3, 60 for item 4, 43 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1194. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 616. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 849 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 616.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 9 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 60 for item 1, 82 for item 2, 95 for item 3, 37 for item 4, 64 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1480. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 981. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 981. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1014 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 981.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 4]\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

Game 78, Round 3, Player 1's turn (Step 5)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 9 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 35 for item 1, 92 for item 2, 53 for item 3, 60 for item 4, 43 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1194. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 616. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 616. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 849 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 616.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 4]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 975 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 445.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 26 for item 1, 82 for item 2, 46 for item 3, 97 for item 4, 83 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 944. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 45. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 45. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1002 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 45.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\

Round 2 Values:\
Player 1: 435.78\
Player 2: 660.96\

================================================================================\
Game 79, Round 3, Player 1's turn (Step 5)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 26 for item 1, 82 for item 2, 46 for item 3, 97 for item 4, 83 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 944. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 45. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 45. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1002 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 45.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 2, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 3, 1]\
Round 2: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 3, 1]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 3, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 18 for item 1, 88 for item 2, 5 for item 3, 64 for item 4, 87 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 750. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 457. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 786 (sum of all item values)\

Game 80, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 18 for item 1, 88 for item 2, 5 for item 3, 64 for item 4, 87 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 750. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 457. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 457. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 786 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 457.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 63 for item 1, 79 for item 2, 47 for item 3, 5 for item 4, 14 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 660. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 198. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 198. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 624 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 198.\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

================================================================================\
Game 80, Round 3, Player 2's turn (Step 6)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 63 for item 1, 79 for item 2, 47 for item 3, 5 for item 4, 14 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 660. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 198. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 198. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 624 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 198.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 73 for item 1, 75 for item 2, 32 for item 3, 17 for item 4, 94 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 430. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 14. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 14. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 14.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    Your outside offer value is 244. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 73 for item 1, 75 for item 2, 32 for item 3, 17 for item 4, 94 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 430. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 14. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 14. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 14.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\

    - What are my item values?\

\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 22 for item 1, 67 for item 2, 23 for item 3, 9 for item 4, 76 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 337. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 92. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 92. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 591 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 92.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\

    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\

\
    3) Let's decide:\

    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 84 for item 1, 63 for item 2, 81 for item 3, 37 for item 4, 70 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 798. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 66. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 66. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1005 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 66.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    \
    What is your action? You can:\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 7 for item 1, 73 for item 2, 42 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 69 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 760. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 291. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 291. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 291.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\

    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 45 for item 1, 93 for item 2, 54 for item 3, 49 for item 4, 76 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1472. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 277. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 277. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 951 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 277.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \

Game 84, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 10 for item 1, 46 for item 2, 41 for item 3, 83 for item 4, 64 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 981. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 778. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 778. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 778.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

Round 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 3, 1, 2]\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 7 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 45 for item 1, 93 for item 2, 54 for item 3, 49 for item 4, 76 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1472. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 277. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 277. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 951 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 277.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\

\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\

\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\

    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\

\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\

    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 3 for item 1, 12 for item 2, 31 for item 3, 33 for item 4, 1 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 357. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 134. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 134. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 240 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 134.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 52 for item 1, 65 for item 2, 50 for item 3, 25 for item 4, 53 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1134. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 977. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 977. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 735 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 977.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 960. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 28. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 28. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 930 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 28.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 27 for item 1, 49 for item 2, 21 for item 3, 63 for item 4, 68 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 642. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 233. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 233. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 684 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 233.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

Game 87, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 27 for item 1, 49 for item 2, 21 for item 3, 63 for item 4, 68 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 642. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 233. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 233. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 684 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 233.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 2, 1]\

Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 37 for item 1, 40 for item 2, 81 for item 3, 61 for item 4, 5 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 568. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 347. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 347. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 672 (sum of all item values)\

    This would be greater than your outside offer of 347.\

Game 89, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 7 for item 1, 14 for item 2, 97 for item 3, 4 for item 4, 6 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 411. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 103. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 103. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 384 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 103.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 877. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 502. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 502. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 741 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 502.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\

================================================================================\
Game 90, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 48 for item 1, 95 for item 2, 80 for item 3, 3 for item 4, 5 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 868. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 135. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 135. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 693 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 135.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 561 (sum of all item values)\

Game 91, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 30 for item 1, 73 for item 2, 59 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 77 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 923. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 378. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 378. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 894 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 378.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\
        - WALK to walk away\
        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 704. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 653. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

Game 91, Round 2, Player 2's turn (Step 4)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 8 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 77 for item 1, 21 for item 2, 43 for item 3, 41 for item 4, 2 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 704. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 653. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 653. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 552 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 653.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 2, 0, 2]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 3]\
Round 2: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 2, 1, 3]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 2, 1, 3]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 93 for item 1, 88 for item 2, 33 for item 3, 28 for item 4, 6 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 856. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 679. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 679. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 744 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 679.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 61 for item 1, 76 for item 2, 20 for item 3, 63 for item 4, 51 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 956. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 573. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 573. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 573.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

Game 92, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 93 for item 1, 88 for item 2, 33 for item 3, 28 for item 4, 6 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 856. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 679. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 679. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 744 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 679.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\

    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 744 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 679.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 68 for item 1, 52 for item 2, 68 for item 3, 28 for item 4, 3 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 786. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 681. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 681. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 681.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 68 for item 1, 52 for item 2, 68 for item 3, 28 for item 4, 3 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 786. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 681. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 681. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 681.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 73 for item 1, 29 for item 2, 71 for item 3, 84 for item 4, 47 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1165. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 466. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 466. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 912 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 466.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 43 for item 1, 29 for item 2, 51 for item 3, 73 for item 4, 25 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 933. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 26. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 26. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 663 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 26.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 33 for item 1, 46 for item 2, 86 for item 3, 14 for item 4, 14 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 816. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 733. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 733. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 579 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be less than your outside offer of 733.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\

    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 67 for item 1, 93 for item 2, 67 for item 3, 48 for item 4, 42 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 678. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 360. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 360. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 951 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 360.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\

    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

Game 95, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 70 for item 1, 61 for item 2, 49 for item 3, 45 for item 4, 79 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 769. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 620. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 620. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 912 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 620.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

    Your outside offer value is 360. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 951 (sum of all item values)\

    Your outside offer value is 620. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 912 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 620.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\

    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\

================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 67 for item 1, 93 for item 2, 67 for item 3, 48 for item 4, 42 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 678. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 360. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 360. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 951 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 360.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 3.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 3]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 3]\

    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 70 for item 1, 61 for item 2, 49 for item 3, 45 for item 4, 79 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 769. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 620. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 620. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 912 (sum of all item values)\

Game 96, Round 1, Player 1's turn (Step 1)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 1 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 46 for item 1, 64 for item 2, 38 for item 3, 52 for item 4, 18 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 784. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 320. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 320. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 654 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 320.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\
    \
        What is your action? As the first player, you can:\

        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)\

Game 97, Round 1, Player 2's turn (Step 2)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 95 for item 1, 49 for item 2, 69 for item 3, 46 for item 4, 10 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 554. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 461. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 461. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 461.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 33 for item 1, 67 for item 2, 77 for item 3, 78 for item 4, 16 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 599. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 261. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 261. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\

    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 261.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\

Game 97, Round 3, Player 1's turn (Step 5)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 33 for item 1, 67 for item 2, 77 for item 3, 78 for item 4, 16 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 599. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 261. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 261. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 261.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\

    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 393.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 1.\

\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 69 for item 1, 74 for item 2, 92 for item 3, 56 for item 4, 36 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 955. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 11. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 11. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 981 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 11.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\

    Your outside offer value is 313. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\

Game 99, Round 2, Player 1's turn (Step 3)\
================================================================================\
\
    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 69 for item 1, 74 for item 2, 92 for item 3, 56 for item 4, 36 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 955. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 11. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 11. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 981 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 11.\
\
    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\
    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power r-1 where r is the round number.\
    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\
    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\
    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\
    Each player receives a value for this outcome determined by their private values per unit of each item, and the units they get in the deal.\
    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\
\
    Let's solve this step by step:\
\
    1) First, let's analyze the current situation:\
    - What is my outside offer value? \
    - What are my item values?\
    - What is the current offer (if any)?\
    - What round are we in and what is the discount factor?\
\
    \
    2) Then, let's calculate:\
    - What is the current discount factor, gamma^(r-1)?\
    - For the current offer (if any): What would be my total value if I accept?\
    - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different divisions?\
    - How do these compare to my outside offer value?\
    - How does the discount factor affect these values?\
\
    3) Let's decide:\
    - Should I accept the current offer?\
    - Should I walk away with my outside offer?\
    - Or should I make a specific COUNTEROFFER?\
\
    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid and treated as a WALK):\
    \{"action": "ACCEPT"\} - to accept the current offer\
    \{"action": "WALK"\} - to walk away from negotiations  \
    \{"action": "COUNTEROFFER", "offer": [n1, n2, ...]\} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing your counteroffer\
\
    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\
\
    It is now round 2.\
\
    Negotiation history:\
Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\
Round 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 0, 1, 0]\
    \
Current offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 1, 0]\
    \
    What is your action? You can:\
    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\
    - WALK to walk away\
    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)\

    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\
    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\
    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\
    There are 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\
    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\
    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 0 to 101.\
    Your private values are 87 for item 1, 77 for item 2, 77 for item 3, 98 for item 4, 24 for item 5.\
    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 1041. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 80% of the value they would get from the maximum offer (the offer that gives them all the items).\
    Your outside offer value is 593. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\
\
    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 593. For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\
    3 units of item 1 = 3 \'d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 2 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 3 = 3 \'d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 4 = 3 \'d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    3 units of item 5 = 3 \'d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\
    Total value = 1089 (sum of all item values)\
    \
    This would be greater than your outside offer of 593.\
