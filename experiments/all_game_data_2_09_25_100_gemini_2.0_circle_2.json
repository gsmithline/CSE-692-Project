Therefore, my private outside offer value is drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 131.\n\nTo make an initial offer, I need to calculate the total value of each possible offer and compare it to my private outside offer value of 216. \n\nLet's consider a few examples:\n\n- If Player 2 offers 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 4 units of item 5:\n  - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 6 = 0\n  - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 23 = 92\n  - Item 3: 5 \u00d7 6 = 30\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n  - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 5 = 20\n  Total value of the offer = 0 + 92 + 30 + 87 + 20 = 229 (which is higher than my private outside offer value)\n\nSince I can get a higher total value by offering nothing, I will choose to WALK away from negotiations.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Given the high values of items 3 and 5, and lower values of items 1 and 4 compared to item 2 and 5 respectively, I'll prioritize those.\n\nHere's my initial offer: [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]\n\nThis means I give 2 units of item 3 and 1 unit each of item 4 and item 5 to Player 2, while keeping all items of type 1 and 2 for myself.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total value of this offer:\n\n- Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 $10/unit = $0\n- Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 $10/unit = $30\n- Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 $52/unit = $104\n- Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 $42/unit = $42\n- Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 $73/unit = $73\n\nTotal value of the offer = $0 + $30 + $104 + $42 + $73 = $249\n\nSince my initial total value was $811 and this offer only amounts to $249, I can accept a better deal. The offer is still worse than my outside offer.\n\nTo calculate whether I should make a counteroffer or walk away, let's consider the discount rate gamma = 0.9. If I choose to accept an offer in future rounds, it will be worth less due to this discount factor.\n\nGiven that my current offer has significantly lower value compared to both our private outside offers and that I'll lose value even if we proceed with more rounds, I should consider walking away from the negotiations now.\n\nHowever, since this is Round 1 and Player 2's action is not known yet, I need to decide based on available information. Given my higher values of items compared to what's offered here, and considering I would lose value even if we proceed with more rounds, the best initial action for me in Round 1 is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Instead, I will aim for a more balanced distribution of items.\n\nLet's try to find a balance between the items. For example, if I offer 1 unit of each item to Player 2 (keeping all 5 units for myself), the total value is:\n\t+ Item 1: 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n\t+ Item 2: 1 \u00d7 90 = 90\n\t+ Item 3: 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n\t+ Item 4: 1 \u00d7 84 = 84\n\t+ Item 5: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n\tTotal value = 23 + 90 + 19 + 84 + 5 = 221\n\nThis offer is still quite high for Player 2, but it's a more balanced distribution than the previous examples.\n\nConsidering the discount rate and the fact that I have a limited number of rounds, I will take this offer to see if Player 2 accepts or makes a counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}",

Given that I can make a counteroffer in later rounds if needed, it might be worth trying to find a compromise.\n\nConsidering all possible initial offers and their corresponding values, I will need to compare them to my outside offer value of 58.\n\nBased on the calculations above, some of the most promising options are:\n- Offering Player 2 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5: Total value = 724\n- Offering Player 2 1 unit of item 1 (keeping 4 units for myself), with other items being offered at a lower value: Total value > 58 but not by much\n\nBased on these calculations, I think my best action in this round is to make an offer that allows me to maximize the value while leaving some room for Player 2 to respond.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 3, 2, 5]}",

Let's assume player 2's private values are:\n- item 1 = x\n- item 2 = y\n- item 3 = z\n- item 4 = w\n- item 5 = v\n\nSince the negotiation history is empty and there's no offer on the table, I'll make an initial offer to try to get a better sense of player 2's values.\n\nLet's start by giving player 2 a small amount of each item. This will give us some information about their preferences:\n\nInitial Offer:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nNow, let's calculate the total value of each item in this offer multiplied by player 1's private values:\n\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 99 = 99\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 14 = 14\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 15 = 15\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n\nTotal value of initial offer: 99 + 14 + 15 + 62 + 34 = 224\n\nNow, let's calculate the total value if player 2 accepts this offer:\n\nPlayer 2 gets:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nValue to player 2: \n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 x (assuming x is a value between 1 and 100)\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 y\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 z\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 w\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 v\n\nTotal value to player 2: x + y + z + w + v (range between 1 and 100)\n\nWe can now see that the initial offer has a total value of 224, which is relatively low. We'll compare this to player 2's outside offer range (1-100) and make our decision based on that.\n\nSince we don't have an exact value for player 2's outside offer, let's assume it's at the lower end of the range: 1.\n\nComparing player 2's outside offer value to the total value of the initial offer:\n224 (initial offer) > 1 (player 2's outside offer)\nThis means that accepting the initial offer would be beneficial for me as the first player, but we need to consider whether this is a good starting point or if there's room for negotiation.\n\nBased on these calculations and comparisons, my action in Round 1 is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine my action in Round 1, I will calculate the total value of the current offer and compare it to my outside offer value.\n\nThe current offer on the table is: [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n\nI have private values per unit of each item:\n- Item 1: 76\n- Item 2: 15\n- Item 3: 36\n- Item 4: 99\n- Item 5: 61\n\nCalculating the total value of the current offer:\n\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 99 = 99\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 61 = 122\n\nTotal value of the current offer: 152 + 30 + 72 + 99 + 122 = 575\n\nNow, I will compare this total value to my outside offer value of 1056. Since 575 is less than 1056, the current offer seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, considering all items, my calculation above was incomplete as it did not take into account that I am also receiving 1 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5 in the deal. Let me recalculate:\n\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n- 1 unit of item 4 (receiving) = 1 \u00d7 99 = 99\n- 2 units of item 5 (receiving) = 2 \u00d7 61 = 122\n\nThe value I receive in the deal is: 152 + 30 + 72 + 99 + 122 = 575\n\nHowever, my total outside offer value is 1056. Considering that player1 gave me less than my true worth, it might be a good time to make an adjustment.\n\nTotal item value for Player 2:\nItem 1: 76\nItem 2: 15\nItem 3: 36\nItem 4: 99\nItem 5: 61\n\nGiven the offer [2, 2, 2, 1, 2], if I were to add one more unit of any item, the total value would be:\n- Item 1: 76 (added as another unit) + 3 \u00d7 76 = 228\n- Item 2: 15 + 3 \u00d7 15 = 60\n- Item 3: 36 + 3 \u00d7 36 = 114\n- Item 4: 99 + 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (already at this value)\n- Item 5: 61 + 3 \u00d7 61 = 184\n\nTotal value of the new offer would be: 228 + 60 + 114 + 297 + 184 = 883.\n\nNow I can compare this total value with my outside offer value of 1056.

My outside offer value is 179.\n\nTo make a counteroffer, I need to calculate the total value of the proposed division for each item type.

Let's assume it is x.\n\nSince we don't know the exact value of x, I will calculate my expected total value and compare it with my private outside offer value.\n\nExpected total value:\nSince both players' private values are drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 101, their expected values for each item type are equal. Let's assume the expected value is e.\n\nMy part of the division (e \u00d7 [3, 2, 3, 1, 3]) = e \u00d7 555\nPlayer 2's part of the division (e \u00d7 [3, 2, 3, 1, 3]) = x \u00d7 555\n\nThe overall value is (e + x) / 2 \u00d7 555. Since I don't know the exact values of e and x, I will assume that my outside offer value of 179 is close to the expected total value.\n\nNow, let's consider a few possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Player 2 offers more than half of the items.\nIn this case, my part of the division would be less than half of the expected total value, making it less valuable than my outside offer. This scenario is likely not optimal for me.\n\nScenario 2: Player 2 offers exactly half of the items.\nIn this case, my part of the division would be equal to half of the expected total value, making it equally valuable to my outside offer.\n\nScenario 3: Player 2 offers less than half of the items.\nIn this case, my part of the division would be more than half of the expected total value, making it more valuable than my outside offer.\n\nSince I don't know the exact values of e and x, I will assume that Scenario 2 is most likely. However, without knowing Player 2's private outside offer value or their actual preferences, I will choose a counteroffer that gives me a good chance to secure a better deal in the next round.\n\nMy counteroffer: [4, 3, 4, 1, 4]\n\nReasoning: By increasing the number of units for items with high values (item 2 and item 5), I increase my chances of securing those items. The other items are increased by a moderate amount to keep the total value comparable.\n\nTotal value calculation:\n4 \u00d7 11 + 3 \u00d7 40 + 4 \u00d7 96 + 1 \u00d7 23 + 4 \u00d7 57 = 44 + 120 + 384 + 23 + 228 = 719\n\nSince this counteroffer gives me a higher total value than the current offer, I will proceed with this action.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 3, 4, 1, 4]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine my action in Round 1, I need to consider my private outside offer value and the potential value of my counteroffer.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of my items: 4 units of item 1 \u00d7 2 = 8, 7 units of item 2 \u00d7 72 = 504, 6 units of item 3 \u00d7 29 = 174, 7 units of item 4 \u00d7 82 = 574, and 6 units of item 5 \u00d7 54 = 324. Total value of my items = 8 + 504 + 174 + 574 + 324 = 1656.\n\nMy private outside offer value is drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to my total value of all items, which is 1584. However, since the problem doesn't specify how I generated this value and given that my action will be based on comparison with an offer made by Player 2, I'll use the provided outside offer values (892 for me and unknown for Player 2) to inform my decision.\n\nSince my total item value is higher than my private outside offer value, making a counteroffer would increase the overall value of the negotiation for me. However, without knowing the exact value of Player 2's private outside offer or their current offer, I'll proceed by considering the potential benefits and risks of making an initial offer.\n\nTo make an informed decision, let's calculate the total value of an offer that gives Player 2 1 unit of each item (keeping 4 units of each for myself): \n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 72 = 72\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 54 = 54\nTotal value of the offer to Player 2 (for my perspective) = 2 + 72 + 29 + 82 + 54 = 239.\n\nConsidering this and the fact that I have a guaranteed alternative with my private outside offer, if I choose not to make an initial offer or counteroffer, I risk walking away with a value lower than what could be achieved through negotiation. However, without knowing Player 2's current offer or their outside offer value, it is difficult to determine whether making an initial offer would be beneficial.\n\nAssuming that making an offer might provide more information and potentially increase the value of the negotiation for both players compared to walking away without any knowledge of the other player's position, I will proceed with making an initial offer. This approach allows me to control the pace of the negotiation and gather information about Player 2's preferences.\n\nGiven these considerations, my action in Round 1 is:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}",

The possible values are from 1 to 187 (since it must be less than or equal to my total private value).\n\nTo maximize my utility, I need to consider how many units of each item I can give away while still receiving a valuable outcome.\n\nLet's try offering 3 units of each item:\n\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 69 = 207\n\nTotal value = 567\n\nSince the total value (567) is greater than my outside offer value (145), I should make a counteroffer to reduce this total value.\n\nTo find the optimal distribution, we need to use a more sophisticated method. We can try different distributions and see which one yields a better outcome for me.\n\nLet's consider a simple case where I give away 1 unit of each item:\n\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 72 = 72\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 69 = 69\n\nTotal value = 189\n\nThis outcome is equal to my private outside offer, so I should not give away more units than this.\n\nNow that I have calculated the potential outcomes, I will make a counteroffer.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Before making any counteroffer, I need to calculate the total value of my proposed offer and compare it to my outside offer value of 251.\n\nLet's assume that Player 2 makes an offer in this round. Since we don't have a specific offer yet, I'll use the general formula for calculating the total value of an offer:\n\nTotal value = n1 \u00d7 v1 + n2 \u00d7 v2 + ... + nk \u00d7 vk\n\nwhere ni is the number of units of item i being offered to me, and vi is my private value per unit of item i.\n\nSince we don't have a specific offer yet, I'll use random values for demonstration purposes. Let's say Player 2 offers me x units of each item:\n\nx units of item 1 = x \u00d7 5\nx units of item 2 = x \u00d7 40\nx units of item 3 = x \u00d7 84\nx units of item 4 = x \u00d7 4\nx units of item 5 = x \u00d7 94\n\nTo calculate the total value, I need to know how many units each player is willing to give up. Since we don't have an offer yet, let's assume that Player 2 is making a random offer.\n\nFor the sake of calculation, let's say Player 2 offers me 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, and so on (keeping in mind this is just for demonstration purposes). The total value would be:\n\nTotal value = (5 \u00d7 5) + (3 \u00d7 40) + (4 \u00d7 84) + (6 \u00d7 4) + (7 \u00d7 94)\n= 25 + 120 + 336 + 24 + 658\n= 1083\n\nNow, let's calculate the total value of my proposed offer. Since we don't have an offer yet, I'll assume a random value.\n\nFor demonstration purposes, let's say I propose offering Player 2 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, and so on.\n\nTotal value of proposal = (4 \u00d7 5) + (5 \u00d7 40) + (6 \u00d7 84) + (8 \u00d7 4) + (3 \u00d7 94)\n= 20 + 200 + 504 + 32 + 282\n= 838\n\nComparing the total values, my proposed offer has a value of 838, which is less than my outside offer value of 251. Since I'm not willing to give up too much, I'll choose to make a counteroffer.\n\nHowever, since this is round 1 and we don't have enough information about Player 2's proposal or their outside offer, it would be better for me to wait until more information becomes available before making a counteroffer. In that case, my action would be:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

To determine my action, I will calculate the expected value of each item type for both myself and Player 1 if we proceed with each possible offer:\n\n- If Player 1 offers x units of Item 1, y units of Item 2, z units of Item 3, w units of Item 4, and v units of Item 5:\n    - My expected value = (365x + 189y + 138z + 315w + 792v) \u00d7 73\n    - Player 1's expected value = (365x + 189y + 138z + 315w + 792v) \u00d7 63\n\nSince my private values are 73, 63, 23, 45, and 99 for Item 1 through Item 5 respectively, I can see that the expected value of each item type is already high. However, to proceed with this calculation and maximize my value, I should make a counteroffer.\n\nAfter analyzing the possible offers, I will choose an offer that maximizes my total value. \n\nLet's consider an example where Player 1 offers:\n- x units of Item 1\n- y units of Item 2\n- z units of Item 3\n- w units of Item 4\n- v units of Item 5\n\nIn this case, I will choose to offer [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means that for this round, the negotiation is between:\n- Player 1: [0, y, z, w, v]\n- Player 2 (me): [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe total value of my counteroffer is: \n3 \u00d7 73 = 219\nTotal value = 219\n\nNow I will calculate the expected value for both players in this scenario:\n- My expected value = 219\n- Player 1's expected value = 219 \u00d7 63 = 13803\n\nSince my total value of all items (1799) is less than my outside offer value (307), and my counteroffer value for this round is 219, which is also lower than the initial outside offer value, I will proceed with a more optimal solution.\n\nTo maximize my expected value in subsequent rounds, I should make additional adjustments to my counteroffers. \n\nConsidering multiple scenarios and adjusting my strategy based on player 1's actions and available options, I can refine my approach for subsequent rounds.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will choose the following action:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]}",

Calculate the total value of my outside offer: \n   My private values are: 71 for item 1, 65 for item 2, 44 for item 3, 21 for item 4, and 65 for item 5.\n   Total value of all items = 71 + 65 + 44 + 21 + 65 = 306\n   Total value of the outside offer = 306 (no discounting needed)\n   \n3. Since my total value of the current offer is less than my total value of my outside offer, I will make a counteroffer to try to get closer to my outside offer value.\n\n4. The optimal counteroffer would be one that gets me as close as possible to my outside offer value while still leaving some room for Player 2 to accept.\n   Let's assume the current round is 2 out of 3 rounds, and we want to apply a discount rate \u03b3 = 0.9.\n   We will calculate the discounted value of our outside offer: \n     Discounted value = 306 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 306 * 0.9 = 275.4\n\n5. Now I need to find the counteroffer that gets me close to this value while still leaving some room for Player 2 to accept.\n   This is a difficult problem, and we will just make an educated guess. \n\nAssume the optimal counteroffer would be: \n[3, 2, 4, 2, 3]\n\n6. Calculate the total value of my counteroffer:\n   3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213\n   2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n   4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 44 = 176\n   2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n   3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n   Total value = 213 + 130 + 176 + 42 + 195 = 756\n\n7. Compare the total value of my counteroffer to the discounted value of my outside offer:\n   Since 756 is less than 275.4, I will adjust my counteroffer to increase its value.\n\nHowever, without access to a calculator or further information about the negotiation dynamics, we can't proceed with calculating the optimal adjustment for this particular response format. For simplicity, we'll stop at our current analysis and choose an action based on our reasoning up until now, even though it is not fully optimized.\n\nGiven that my counteroffer would likely be something like [3, 2, 4, 2, 3], I will take a similar direction to try to get closer to the outside offer value.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Let's assume I make an offer with the following quantities:\n\n[n1, n2, n3, n4, n5]\n\nMy calculation for the total value of each item type would be:\n- Item 1: n1 \u00d7 56\n- Item 2: n2 \u00d7 68\n- Item 3: n3 \u00d7 9\n- Item 4: n4 \u00d7 67\n- Item 5: n5 \u00d7 91\n\nMy private outside offer value is 256, which is significantly lower than the total value of all items (1321). Therefore, making a counteroffer with quantities that are close to my private outside offer value would be reasonable.\n\nHowever, since I don't know Player 2's private values or their outside offer value, I'll assume a conservative approach and make an initial offer that is not too generous. Let's say:\n\n[n1, n2, n3, n4, n5] = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis means I'm offering to give Player 2 one unit of each item type.\n\nMy calculation for the total value of this offer would be:\n- Item 1: 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 68 = 68\n- Item 3: 0 \u00d7 9 = 0 (since I'm not giving any units of item 3)\n- Item 4: 0 \u00d7 67 = 0\n- Item 5: 0 \u00d7 91 = 0\n\nTotal value = 56 + 68 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 124\n\nSince the total value of this offer (124) is lower than my private outside offer value (256), I will make a counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}",

                    "response": "To determine my action, I need to calculate the total value of each possible offer and compare it to my outside offer value.\n\nLet's consider a few scenarios:\n\n- If I offer 0 units of any item, I get all 4 units of item 1 (4 \u00d7 38 = 152), 3 units of item 2 (3 \u00d7 56 = 168), 4 units of item 3 (4 \u00d7 83 = 332), 3 units of item 4 (3 \u00d7 78 = 234), and 5 units of item 5 (5 \u00d7 85 = 425). Total value = 1361.\n\n- If I offer 1 unit of any item, I get 3 units of that item.

                    "response": "To determine my action in this round, I need to calculate the total value of accepting Player 1's current offer and compare it to my outside offer value.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of accepting Player 1's offer:\n\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 85 = 170\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213\n\nTotal value = 192 + 176 + 282 + 170 + 213 = 1033\n\nNow, let's compare this total value to my outside offer value. Since 1033 is less than 265, I should consider making a counteroffer.\n\nMy outside offer value of 265 is higher than the calculated total value of accepting Player 1's current offer (1033). To maximize my value in this round, I will make a counteroffer that reduces the items offered to me but increases the overall value of the deal for both players. Given that the discount rate \u03b3 = 0.9, and assuming that Player 1 is willing to offer more units of item 5 (since it has a higher value), I would like to adjust my offer slightly towards this item.\n\nHowever, without specific numerical details on how much I can counteroffer or what discount factor should be applied directly to the items, I must make an educated guess based on typical negotiation strategies and the distribution of values. Considering that both players have private outside offers drawn from a uniform random distribution, it seems reasonable for Player 1 to offer more units of item 5 initially due to its higher value.\n\nGiven these considerations, my best approach is to make a counteroffer that reduces the amount of lower-value items while maintaining or slightly increasing the units of the higher-value item. For simplicity and without further information on how to adjust the counteroffer precisely, I will choose to offer fewer units of item 1, keeping more of its value per unit, while offering more units of item 5.\n\nLet's calculate a reasonable adjustment for these items:\n\n- Reduce 2 units of item 1 to keep more of its value (considering it has the highest value among the options): 1 unit\n- Increase the number of units of item 5 offered by 1: 4\n\nNow, let's calculate the total value of this adjusted counteroffer:\n\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 85 = 170\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 71 = 284\n\nTotal value = 96 + 176 + 282 + 170 + 284 = 1088\n\nThis adjusted counteroffer seems more reasonable and increases the overall value. However, to maintain a strategic balance without overcomplicating this step-by-step negotiation process, I will directly provide my action as per the required format.\n\nGiven these considerations and adjusting for typical strategic behavior in such negotiations:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 306. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 549 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The total value of each unit type is the product of its private value per unit and the number of units offered.\n\nThe calculation for the total value V(x, y, z, w, v) would be:\nV(x, y, z, w, v) = x \u00d7 29 + y \u00d7 52 + z \u00d7 69 + w \u00d7 67 + v \u00d7 9\n\nHowever, since Player 2 is also making an offer to me, I need to consider that as well.

This is not an attractive option.\n* For other values of x, y, z, w, and v, we need to calculate the total value V(x, y, z, w, v) and compare it to my outside offer value of 510.\n\nWithout knowing Player 2's exact offers, I will make a counteroffer. Let me consider an initial offer that would be a balanced one:\n\nInitial Offer = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] (1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, and 1 unit of item 4)\n\nTotal Value of Initial Offer = 1 \u00d7 29 + 1 \u00d7 52 + 1 \u00d7 69 + 1 \u00d7 67 + 0 \u00d7 9 = 217\n\nSince the total value of this initial offer is less than my outside offer value of 510, I will make a counteroffer.\n\nAction: {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}",

Offering 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, ..., 4 units of item 5:\n   - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n   - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 17 = 34\n   - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 39 = 0\n   - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n   - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 16 = 32\n   Total value: 168\n\nTo maximize my total value, I will make an offer that includes as many units of items with high private values per unit. Let's assume I want to start by offering a moderate amount of each item.\n\nOffer: [1, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total value for this offer:\n- Item 1: 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n- Item 3: 0 \u00d7 39 = 0\n- Item 4: 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n- Item 5: 1 \u00d7 16 = 16\nTotal value: 115\n\nComparing this to my outside offer value of 154, I decide that making an initial offer is a good strategy. Therefore, my action in round 1 is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 2, 1]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 70. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 846 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine my action in Round 1, I need to calculate the total value of a counteroffer and compare it to my outside offer value.\n\nLet's assume an arbitrary counteroffer: [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5]. The total value of this counteroffer would be:\n\nTotal value = (x1 \u00d7 93) + (x2 \u00d7 86) + (x3 \u00d7 23) + (x4 \u00d7 58) + (x5 \u00d7 22)\n\nTo find the maximum possible value, I need to maximize this expression.\n\nAssuming a uniform random distribution for x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5, we can calculate the expected value of each item. However, since we are trying to maximize the total value, we want to focus on maximizing the items that provide the highest value per unit.\n\nGiven my private values, I would prioritize items 3 (23) and 4 (58), as they have the lowest and highest values per unit, respectively. Items 1 (93) and 2 (86) are also relatively high in value per unit. Item 5 (22) has a lower value per unit.\n\nLet's start by making a counteroffer that includes items with the highest value per unit:\n\nCounteroffer: [0, 0, x3, x4, 0]\n\nThis leaves me with the maximum value from item 3 and item 4. Now, I need to calculate the total value of this offer.\n\nTotal value = (0 \u00d7 93) + (0 \u00d7 86) + (x3 \u00d7 23) + (x4 \u00d7 58)\n\nSince x3 and x4 are random variables, we can't calculate an exact total value without knowing their values. However, we can express the total value as a function of x3 and x4:\n\nTotal value = 23x3 + 58x4\n\nTo maximize this expression, I would want to allocate as many units as possible from items 3 and 4.\n\nNow, let's consider my outside offer value: 70. If Player 2 makes an acceptable counteroffer that exceeds this value, I should accept it. Otherwise, I will make a more detailed counteroffer or walk away.\n\nSince the negotiation is in its first round, I don't have enough information about Player 2's values and preferences to make a highly informed decision. However, I can start by making a relatively balanced offer that includes items with moderate value per unit:\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 1, 0, 3, 0]\n\nThis leaves me with some units from item 2, some units from item 4, and none from items 5.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total value of this offer:\n\nTotal value = (1 \u00d7 93) + (1 \u00d7 86) + (0 \u00d7 23) + (3 \u00d7 58) + (0 \u00d7 22)\n= 93 + 86 + 174\n= 353\n\nTo determine if I should accept, reject, or counteroffer again, I would need to know Player 2's response. If they make a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer value of 70, I will accept it.\n\nSince I don't have this information yet, I'll provide the following action:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 3, 0]}",

Since there are 5 items with values ranging from 1 to 101, and I have a private outside offer drawn from this distribution, we can assume that the mean is around (1+101)/2 = 51. However, as I do not know the exact number, we will use my total value of all items: 75 + 39 + 75 + 66 + 94 = 329. The outside offer value is drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to this total value, so let's assume it is around 80 (since 329/4 \u2248 82.25). We can use 81 as an upper bound for the calculation.\n\nNow I will generate an outside offer value:\nMy outside offer value = 80 + uniform(0, 11) = 90\n\nComparing this to my total value of the current offer (312), we see that accepting the current offer would be better than walking away. Now let's compare it to my private outside offer.\n\nSince my total value (329) is higher than my outside offer value (90), I should reject Player 1's offer and instead choose to keep my outside offer.\n\nSince the negotiation history doesn't provide an initial offer, my action in this round will be:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "To determine my action in Round 1, I need to consider my private values and outside offer. Since we are in the first round, neither player has an existing offer on the table.\n\nMy private values per unit of each item type are: \n- Item 1: 4\n- Item 2: 69\n- Item 3: 10\n- Item 4: 82\n- Item 5: 77\n\nThe total value of my items is 947. My outside offer value, which I have a guarantee for, is 648.\n\nTo make an initial offer to Player 2, let's consider dividing the items in a way that provides me with a fair share while also taking into account our private values. A straightforward approach would be to divide the items as equally as possible among us, considering their quantities and my private values per unit.\n\nGiven the numbers of each item (5 units of Item 1, 4 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4, and 5 units of Item 5), I will make an offer that is slightly weighted towards items with higher private values per unit.\n\nLet's propose the following initial offer: [1, 1.5, 1, 1.25, 2]. This means:\n\n- I give 1 unit of Item 1 to Player 2.\n- I give 1.5 units of Item 2 to Player 2 (since half a unit is not possible, this approach provides more value to me than the full 1.5 for Player 2).\n- I give 1 unit of Item 3 to Player 2.\n- I give 1.25 units of Item 4 to Player 2 (similarly adjusting the distribution to favor my side while still providing a good amount for Player 2).\n- I give 2 units of Item 5 to Player 2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total value of this offer:\n\n- 1 unit of Item 1: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n- 1.5 units of Item 2: 1.5 \u00d7 69 = 103.5 (approx.)\n- 1 unit of Item 3: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n- 1.25 units of Item 4: 1.25 \u00d7 82 = 102.5\n- 2 units of Item 5: 2 \u00d7 77 = 154\n\nTotal value for my offer \u2248 369.5\n\nComparing this to my outside offer value of 648, the initial offer seems relatively low. Given that we are in Round 1 and the negotiation has just begun, it's essential to make a strong first move while considering our private values.\n\nConsidering these factors, I choose to make an initial offer of [1, 1.5, 1, 1.25, 2].\n\nHowever, since this is not one of the specified action formats, my response should be adjusted according to the correct format:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1.5, 1, 1.25, 2]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 299. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 330 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine my action in round 1, I need to consider my private outside offer value and the potential value of making an offer to Player 2.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of all items: 4 units of item 1 + 3 units of item 2 + 4 units of item 3 + 2 units of item 4 + 2 units of item 5 = 15 units. Since my private outside offer value is drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to 354, the expected value of my outside offer is (1+354)/2 = 177.5.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total value of each possible initial offer:\n- For an initial offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the total value is 0.\n- For an initial offer of [n1, n2, ...], where n1, n2, ..., are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to Player 2, we need to calculate the value of each item type and sum them up.\n\nSince there are no offers on the table yet, I don't have enough information to make a precise calculation. However, I can consider the general strategy for this type of negotiation game.\n\nIn general, when making an initial offer, it's often beneficial to start with a moderate amount of items offered to Player 2 and keep a larger number of items for yourself. This allows you to test the waters, gauge Player 2's reaction, and potentially negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds.\n\nGiven that my private values are relatively high for item 3 and low for item 4 and 5, I may want to prioritize those items when making an initial offer. However, without more information about Player 2's preferences or outside offer value, it's difficult to determine the optimal initial offer.\n\nConsidering these factors, I will choose a moderate initial offer that balances my need to test the waters with my private values for each item type.\n\nInitial offer: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nThis offers Player 2 one unit of items 1 and 2, no units of item 3, one unit of item 4, and one unit of item 5. The total value of this initial offer is:\n- 1 \u00d7 28 = 28 (item 1)\n- 1 \u00d7 14 = 14 (item 2)\n- 0 \u00d7 32 = 0 (item 3)\n- 1 \u00d7 24 = 24 (item 4)\n- 1 \u00d7 12 = 12 (item 5)\n\nTotal value of initial offer: 28 + 14 + 0 + 24 + 12 = 78\n\nI will now provide my action as a JSON response:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]}",

Since this is the first round, both players have not yet made any offers, so we can proceed by calculating a hypothetical initial offer from Player 2.\n\nLet's assume Player 2 makes an initial offer that provides a balanced division of items to keep things simple for analysis. If Player 2 were to offer me 1 unit each of item 4 and 5 (keeping all other items), I would calculate the total value as follows:\n\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 89 = 89\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 83 = 83\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 37 = 37 (kept by me, so I don't need to calculate its value)\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 77 = 77 (kept by me, so I don't need to calculate its value)\n\nTotal Value for Me = 3 + 89 + 83 = 175\n\nNow, let's compare this total value with my outside offer value of 1109. Since the total value from Player 2's initial hypothetical offer is significantly lower than what I could potentially get from my own private values if we were to divide items more equally (considering each item's unique value), I would likely not choose an option that doesn't maximize the potential value.\n\nConsidering the balanced division and discount rate gamma = 0.9, a strategic approach might involve setting up a counteroffer early on to see how Player 2 reacts. However, given the lack of information about Player 2's private values and outside offer, it would be too speculative to propose an initial counteroffer without potentially missing out on a higher value outcome.\n\nGiven this analysis, my preferred action for Round 1 is to:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Since 795 is greater than 613, I will not make a counteroffer in this round.\n\nNow that we have eliminated the possibility of making a counteroffer, let's evaluate Player 2's possible actions and then choose our own action. \n\nGiven the current offer [3, 3, 4, 1, 1], if Player 2 chooses to ACCEPT, the negotiation will end in a deal.\n\nIf Player 2 chooses to WALK away, we can determine that by looking at their private outside offer value.\n\nPlayer 2's private outside offer value is unknown. However, since they offered [3, 3, 4, 1, 1] and their total value of all items is also unknown but greater than my outside offer value (613), it is not reasonable to assume that Player 2 would accept an offer less valuable than their own.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the negotiation ends without a deal, Player 2's choice will be WALK away. This means that regardless of our action in this round, the outcome will favor us due to the discount rate (gamma = 0.9).\n\nSince we don't know Player 2's private outside offer value and it is not reasonable for them to accept a lower offer than their own if they had one, we must make an action that allows us to maximize our expected value.\n\nGiven this information, I will choose an action that maximizes my expected value in the next round. Since we cannot reasonably assume Player 2's private outside offer value or expect them to walk away given the current situation, it is best for me to maintain flexibility by making a counteroffer to keep the negotiation open and potentially maximize our overall value.\n\nHowever, based on the information available at this point, without being able to calculate the discount factor, we cannot accurately determine what would be a \"best\" action in terms of expected value under the current constraints. Therefore, I will follow the general guideline that allows us to move forward by considering a range of possible actions and their implications.\n\nTo keep the negotiation open while minimizing potential losses due to other player's outside offers (which we cannot control), let's make a counteroffer that gives away as few items as necessary while keeping some flexibility for future rounds.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will choose an action:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 3, 3, 1, 2]}",

I get 0 units, so its value is 0.\nItem 2: Player 1 gets 3 units, so its value is 3 \u00d7 34 = 102. I get 2 units, so its value is 2 \u00d7 92 = 184.\nItem 3: Player 1 gets 3 units, so its value is 3 \u00d7 23 = 69. I get 1 unit, so its value is 1 \u00d7 92 = 92.\nItem 4: Player 1 gets 1 unit, so its value is 1 \u00d7 34 = 34. I get 0 units, so its value is 0.\nItem 5: Player 1 gets 2 units, so its value is 2 \u00d7 23 = 46. I get 3 units, so its value is 3 \u00d7 58 = 174.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total value for each player:\n\nPlayer 1's total value: 136 + 102 + 69 + 34 + 46 = 387\nMy total value: 0 + 184 + 92 + 0 + 174 = 450\n\nThe discount rate gamma is 0.9, so I need to adjust the values by multiplying them with (1 - gamma)^1 = 0.1.\n\nPlayer 1's adjusted total value: 387 \u00d7 0.1 = 38.7\nMy adjusted total value: 450 \u00d7 0.1 = 45\n\nSince my adjusted total value is higher than Player 1's, it makes sense for me to make a counteroffer.\n\nI will now calculate my counteroffer. I want to give away as few units of item 2 as possible while keeping as many units of item 5 as possible. Let's start with the maximum number of units of item 5 I can give: 3 units. This leaves me with 1 unit of item 2.\n\nItem 1: I will give 4 units (but this is already part of the offer, so I'll just say it remains at 4).\nItem 2: I will give 1 unit.\nItem 3: I will give 3 units.\nItem 4: I will give 1 unit.\nItem 5: I will give 3 units.\n\nNow, let's calculate my counteroffer value:\n\nItem 1: 4 \u00d7 34 = 136\nItem 2: 1 \u00d7 92 = 92\nItem 3: 3 \u00d7 23 = 69\nItem 4: 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\nItem 5: 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\nTotal value of counteroffer: 136 + 92 + 69 + 24 + 174 = 455\n\nSince the total value of my original outside offer is 557, and the total value of my counteroffer is 455, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 3, 1, 3]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 471. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 891 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
