Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 800. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 800. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 915 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 1 + 20 x 0 + 77 x 2 + 100 x 3 + 79 x 4\n    which is 799 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 800. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action, let's proceed step-by-step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside offer value:** My guaranteed fallback option is 800.\n   - **Values of the items:**\n     - Item 1: 29 per unit\n     - Item 2: 20 per unit\n     - Item 3: 77 per unit\n     - Item 4: 100 per unit\n     - Item 5: 79 per unit\n   - **Total pool of items:**\n     - 7 units of Item 1\n     - 5 units of Item 2\n     - 4 units of Item 3\n     - 3 units of Item 4\n     - 7 units of Item 5\n\n   - **Discount factor:** The value is adjusted by the discount factor 0.9 raised to the power of (r-1). Since this is round 1, there is no discount applied yet.\n\n2) **Assess the value of counteroffers:**\n   - Aim to achieve a value greater than my outside offer (800).\n\n   Let's start by distributing the items to maximize my valuation above 800:\n\n   - If I keep 4 units of item 4 (which are worth the most to me) and 3 units of item 5, this would be:\n     - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n     - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 79 = 237\n\n   Since I need to attain a value over 800, I'll add 3 units of item 3, yielding: \n   - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 77 = 231\n\n   Total value becomes 300 + 237 + 231 = 768. Not sufficient yet.\n\n   I will maintain the items strategically valuable to me and check:\n\n   If I keep all 3 units of item 4 and all units of item 5 (assuming they don't value these as much as I do):\n   - Item 5: 7 \u00d7 79 = 553 total in addition to the item 4 value.\n   - Item 4: 300\n   - Total would be 553 + 300 = 853, which exceeds my fallback value satisfactorily.\n\n   I'll fill in units of item 1 or item 2 to further maximize within my balance:\n   - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 29 = 87\n\n   This yields 853 + 87, totaling 940.\n\n   The counteroffer then provides the rest to the player 2:\n\n   For counteroffer:\n   - Item distribution for Player 2: \n     - Item 1: 4\n     - Item 2: 5\n     - Item 3: 4\n     - Item 4: 0\n     - Item 5: 0\n\n   My remaining units \"kept\":\n   - Item 1: 3\n   - Item 2: 0\n   - Item 3: 0\n   - Item 4: 3\n   - Item 5: 7\n\n   This should securely net over 800.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on analysis:**\n   - Formulated counteroffer value exceeds outside offer and possible significant negotiation value.\n\nI will propose this initial counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 5, 4, 0, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 1 + 20 x 0 + 77 x 2 + 100 x 3 + 79 x 4\n    which is 799 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 800. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 5, 4, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [7, 5, 4, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [7, 5, 4, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 35 x 1 + 25 x 0 + 47 x 2 + 49 x 1\n    which is 178 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 179. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 35 x 1 + 25 x 0 + 47 x 2 + 49 x 1\n    which is 178 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 179. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 1, 3, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's assess the current offer and potential counteroffers.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation**:\n   - **My outside offer value**: 179\n   - **Values of items to me**:\n     - Item 1: 2 per unit\n     - Item 2: 35 per unit\n     - Item 3: 25 per unit\n     - Item 4: 47 per unit\n     - Item 5: 49 per unit\n   - **Total pool of items**: 7 item 1, 3 item 2, 5 item 3, 8 item 4, 3 item 5\n   - **Discount factor**: Round 2 discount factor, gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers**:\n   - **Value if I accept the current offer [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]**:\n     - Item 3: 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n     - Item 4: 1 unit \u2192 1 \u00d7 47 = 47\n     - **Total value** = 50 + 47 = 97\n   - **Value comparison**:\n     - The current offer value (97) is less than my outside offer (179), even without considering the discount factor.\n\n3) **Decision making**:\n   - **Accept the current offer?** No, because the value (97) is less than my outside offer value (179).\n   - **Walk away?** Not yet, since it's better to counter offer in hope of getting a value higher than my outside offer.\n   - **Propose a counteroffer?** Yes, find an offer better than my outside offer while considering previous offers for strategic insights.\n\n   Since Player 2 offered more units of item 3 and kept no items of 1, 2, or 5, it's likely that Player 2 values items 1, 2, and 5 much more than items 3 and 4.

I will create a counteroffer where my share is worth more than my outside offer, which is 24.\n\n   I will consider keeping the most valuable items according to my private values:\n\n   - Propose giving Player 2 a modest portion of lower-value item 3 (since it's least valuable to me).\n\n   Let's evaluate this distribution strategy, where I might keep high-value items and most of the others:\n\n   - 0 units of item 1 (offer all of it as it\u2019s a low quantity)\n   - 1 unit of item 2 (offer 5 units)\n   - 2 units of item 3 (offer none)\n   - 1 unit of item 4 (offer 2 units)\n   - 2 unit of item 5 (offer 2 units)\n\n   Calculating my value with this distribution:\n   - Value from item 1 = 0 \u00d7 15 = 0\n   - Value from item 2 = 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n   - Value from item 3 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n   - Value from item 4 = 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n   - Value from item 5 = 2 \u00d7 70 = 140\n   \n   Total value = 228\n\n   This proposed offer yields a value significantly higher than my outside offer of 24, making it a beneficial counteroffer.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n\n   Given the analysis, my best strategy is to make a counteroffer that maximizes my value. \n\n   Therefore, my action will be:\n\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 0, 2, 2]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 771. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 771. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 1, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    98 x 0 + 97 x 6 + 40 x 1 + 48 x 1 + 25 x 4\n    which is 770 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 771. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 0, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 5, 0, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's analyze the situation:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 771.\n   - My values per unit for each item: \n     - Item 1: 98\n     - Item 2: 97\n     - Item 3: 40\n     - Item 4: 48\n     - Item 5: 25\n   - Total items available: 1 unit of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor gamma = 0.9, affecting future round values. However, I'll focus on current values since any counteroffer beyond round 3 is essentially a walk.\n\n2) Assess the value of the current offer:\n   - Current offer to me: [1, 5, 0, 2, 2]\n   - My value for this offer:\n     - Item 1: 1 x 98 = 98\n     - Item 2: 5 x 97 = 485\n     - Item 3: 0 x 40 = 0\n     - Item 4: 2 x 48 = 96\n     - Item 5: 2 x 25 = 50\n   - Total value = 98 + 485 + 96 + 50 = 729\n\n3) Decision making:\n   - The current offer gives me a total value of 729, which is less than my outside offer of 771. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away yields a value of 771, which is better than accepting the current offer (avoids Mistake 5).\n   - Let's consider a potential counteroffer. I need to propose a division that gives me a value of more than 771.\n\nTo create a viable counteroffer:\n - I need to receive a combination of items whose calculated value exceeds 771.\n - I will try to keep more from items with higher personal values.\n\nPotential counteroffer:\n- Offer Player 1: [0, 2, 2, 2, 1], keeping [1, 4, 0, 1, 3].\n\nCalculating my value for this counteroffer:\n   - My units: [1, 4, 0, 1, 3]\n     - Item 1: 1 x 98 = 98\n     - Item 2: 4 x 97 = 388\n     - Item 3: 0 x 40 = 0\n     - Item 4: 1 x 48 = 48\n     - Item 5: 3 x 25 = 75\n   - Total value = 98 + 388 + 48 + 75 = 609\n\n This counteroffer is still below my outside offer of 771. Let's make another attempt:\n\nFinal counteroffer:\n- Offer Player 1: [0, 3, 2, 1, 0], keeping [1, 3, 0, 2, 4].\n\nCalculating my value for this counteroffer:\n   - My units: [1, 3, 0, 2, 4]\n     - Item 1: 1 x 98 = 98\n     - Item 2: 3 x 97 = 291\n     - Item 3: 0 x 40 = 0\n     - Item 4: 2 x 48 = 96\n     - Item 5: 4 x 25 = 100\n   - Total value = 98 + 291 + 96 + 100 = 585\n\nUnfortunately, the adjustment doesn't reach above 771 either. Given the high outside offer, achieving a deal significantly better than 771 in this configuration is challenging without more information about Player 1's valuations to guide better strategic concessions.\n\nIn this situation, these counteroffers are not better than my outside offer. Thus, the best strategy is to walk away, accepting the guaranteed payoff from the outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 5, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 0 + 97 x 2 + 53 x 5 + 88 x 3 + 50 x 2\n    which is 823 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 824. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 6, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 0 + 86 x 2 + 75 x 6 + 87 x 3 + 83 x 0\n    which is 883 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 884. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the optimal action, I must first consider the current situation, analyze potential offers, and then decide based on maximizing my value.\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 884.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 89\n     - Item 2: 86\n     - Item 3: 75\n     - Item 4: 87\n     - Item 5: 83\n   - The total pool of items: \n     - Item 1: 1 unit\n     - Item 2: 2 units\n     - Item 3: 6 units\n     - Item 4: 6 units\n     - Item 5: 2 units\n   - Discount factor: At this stage (round 1), the discount factor does not apply as this is the initial round. \n\n2) Assess potential counteroffers:\n   - Since this is the first round, there is no offer on the table to evaluate.\n   - I need to propose an initial offer that will ensure I receive a value greater than my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - To maximize my value, I should aim for a distribution of items that provides me with a value equal to or greater than 884.\n   - Consider an initial division where I keep more of the high-value items as per my private values.\n\nFor example, if I make the initial offer to Player 2 as [0, 0, 5, 4, 1], I keep [1, 2, 1, 2, 1].\n  \nCalculating the value of what I keep:\n   - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 89 = 89\n   - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 86 = 172\n   - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 75 = 75\n   - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 87 = 174\n   - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 83 = 83\n\nTotal value = 89 + 172 + 75 + 174 + 83 = 593\n\nThis proposed division doesn't satisfy my threshold as it falls below my outside offer of 884. I'll adjust the allocation to enhance the value:\n\nRe-evaluate to offer [1, 2, 5, 6, 0], keeping [0, 0, 1, 0, 2] for myself:\n\nCalculating the value of what I keep:\n   - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 89 = 0\n   - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 86 = 0\n   - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 75 = 75\n   - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 87 = 0\n   - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 83 = 166\n\nTotal value = 75 + 166 = 241\n\nAgain, this doesn't work. To find a suitable initial offer that surpasses 884, I should aim to retain units with higher values, especially more from item types 1 and 4.\n\nPropose [0, 1, 6, 6, 0] (offering all units of items 3 and 4):\n\nKeeping [1, 1, 0, 0, 2]:\n\nCalculating value:\n   - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 89 = 89\n   - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 86 = 86\n   - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 83 = 166\n   Total value = 89 + 86 + 166 = 341\n\nEven though the proposal seems suboptimal, initially propose [0, 1, 4, 5, 0] to ensure an improved position through iteration and avoiding common mistakes listed. \n\nTherefore, the initial counteroffer will be: \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 4, 5, 0]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 913. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 913. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 891 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 5, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 0 + 14 x 2 + 66 x 5 + 95 x 5 + 79 x 1\n    which is 912 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 913. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's try modifying the distribution:\n\nBecause I must secure a total value greater than 996 and be reasonable in what I provide, I'll attempt with another configuration:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [0, 0, 4, 0, 5], Keeping for myself: [5, 3, 0, 3, 1]:\n  - My retained value = 500 + 105 + 0 + 279 + 27 = 911, still lower than 996.\n\nFurther revision is needed to secure a value that exceeds 996.

I will have to offer something less of these to Player 2, balancing between my high valuation and overall necessity.\n\nThis requires another decision iteration and insight on my resources:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [0, 1, 4, 0, 6], Keeping for myself: [5, 2, 0, 3, 0]:\n  - My retained value = (5 \u00d7 100) + (2 \u00d7 35) + (0 \u00d7 1) + (3 \u00d7 93) + (0 \u00d7 27) \n                      = 500 + 70 + 0 + 279 + 0 = 849, still lower than 996.\n\nGiven this, to seek likely an advantageous initial bid:\n \n- Offer Player 2: [0, 0, 4, 0, 6], Retaining: [5, 3, 0, 3, 0]:\n  - Calculated value left: (5 \u00d7 100) + (3 \u00d7 35) + (0 \u00d7 1) + (3 \u00d7 93) + (0 \u00d7 27) = 500 + 105 + 0 + 279 + 0 = 884, also less than 996.\n\nEvidently, giving any away nearly across the substantial item outvalues my reserve consistently, hence I need to transition thought to vital existoning holders af contention:\n\n- Consider other avenues in your procureth augment or deduction wherein Population 5 holds significately undermounded item potential.\n\nFor fullest consideration against 996, time is to draw closely deliberate within orientees:\n\nAdjusting to ultimately sample current and augmented run relieving less valued items:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [1, 0, 4, 1, 6], Keeping for myself: [4, 3, 0, 2, 0]\n   From estimative retention: (4 \u00d7 100) + (3 \u00d7 35) + (0 \u00d7 1) + (2 \u00d7 93) + (0 \u00d7 27) = 400 + 105 + 0 + 186 + 0 = 691.\n\nThe analysis shows that no plausible proactive reallocation enables surpassing your outside offer of 996 without unreasonable push upon maximizing possess.\n\nThus, recollection from scenarioe offering to continue negotiations for ameliorative potential would logically lead to wrapping and safeguarding existent secure fallback holding.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:** Based on all trial action regarding balancing of initial exchanges exceeding 996 appears impractical, opting for outwalk should present unavoidable considering parameters.\n\nConsidering every factor: {\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1177. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1177. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 855 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 4, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    98 x 4 + 63 x 5 + 42 x 4 + 75 x 4 + 7 x 0\n    which is 1175 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1177. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's go through the analysis step-by-step:\n\n1) Current Situation Analysis:\n   - My outside offer value is 1177.\n   - The values I assign to each item are:\n     - Item 1: 98\n     - Item 2: 63\n     - Item 3: 42\n     - Item 4: 75\n     - Item 5: 7\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n   - The discount factor, gamma = 0.9, means that the value of a deal would diminish slightly each round; however, in this first round, there's no reduction.\n\nSince there's no current offer from Player 2 to evaluate, let\u2019s consider potential offers we could make. The goal is to keep a total value of more than my outside offer of 1177 while making a reasonable offer to Player 2.\n\n2) Assessing Potential Counteroffers:\n   \n   I need to divide the items in a way that the total value I keep is maximized without going below my outside offer. Let's calculate a few test distributions:\n\n   Let's test keeping a significant portion of high-value items first:\n\n   - Offer: [0, 3, 4, 4, 1] (i.e., giving 0 items of item 1, 3 items of item 2, 4 items of item 3, 4 items of item 4, 1 item of item 5 to Player 2. I keep [4, 2, 2, 2, 0]):\n\n     Value for me = (4 * 98) + (2 * 63) + (2 * 42) + (2 * 75) + (0 * 7)\n                  = 392 + 126 + 84 + 150 + 0 \n                  = 752\n\n   The value 752 is below my outside offer. Let's try a different division:\n\n   - Offer: [0, 0, 4, 2, 1] (i.e., giving 0 items of item 1, 0 items of item 2, 4 items of item 3, 2 items of item 4, 1 item of item 5 to Player 2. I keep [4, 5, 2, 4, 0]):\n\n     Value for me = (4 * 98) + (5 * 63) + (2 * 42) + (4 * 75) + (0 * 7)\n                  = 392 + 315 + 84 + 300 + 0\n                  = 1091\n\n   The value 1091 is still below my outside offer. Let's try giving away more low-value items:\n\n   - Offer: [1, 5, 5, 6, 1] (i.e., giving 1 item of item 1, 5 items of item 2, 5 items of item 3, 6 items of item 4, 1 item of item 5 to Player 2. I keep [3, 0, 1, 0, 0]):\n\n     Value for me = (3 * 98) + (0 * 63) + (1 * 42) + (0 * 75) + (0 * 7)\n                  = 294 + 0 + 42 + 0 + 0\n                  = 336\n\n   The value 336 is too low. This offer isn\u2019t viable either. It is challenging to give away too many high-value items while retaining more than 1177.\n\nAfter testing such arrangements, it's becoming apparent that I need to retain significant values in lower item quantities more than high values in single-item types. Let\u2019s attempt holding onto as many valuable items as possible while offering others that we intrinsically value less to Player 2. \n\nGiven the number of valuable items, let's make an optimal initial counteroffer:\n\n   - Offer: [0, 5, 6, 6, 0] (i.e., giving all of the low-value items away):\n\n     My items = [4, 0, 0, 0, 1]:\n\nValue for me = (4 * 98) + (0 * 63) + (0 * 42) + (0 * 75) + (1 * 7) = 392 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 7 = 399\n\n399 is quite significantly below 1177. We need to find the right balance, but since there are no acceptable configurations thus far giving different ideas of how accommodating and how positions we need to be changed.\n\n3) Decision: \n   With this analysis of my initial counteroffers being worse than the baseline requirement, let's consider a simple counteroffer that takes more potentially favorable reception :(I need to construct offers where units of at least item 1 remain, potentially coupled with potential low competitor combinations):\n\n- Offer: [0, 2, 4, 5, 1]\n\nCounteoffer to give: keeping: 4, 3, 2, 1, 0\n\nValue for me = (4 * 98) + (3 * 63) + (2 * 42) + (1 * 75) + (0 * 7) \n              = 392 + 189 + 84 + 75 = 740\n\n740 still feels suboptimal, let's select ideal symmetric setup where I don't limit extremes:\n\nFinally - Ideal counter pattern to precision: \n\nOffer: [2, 3, 3, 4, 1]\n\nNow keeping: 2, 2, 3, 2, 0 \n\nValue for me = (2 * 98) + (2 * 63) + (3 * 42) + (2 * 75) + (0 * 7)\n              = 196 + 126 + 126 + 150\n              = 598\n\n598 - Unrealistic strong gives optimal value depending how others can weight plan assumption. \n\nGiven intermediation incorporated standalone significant intervals. Aim stronger & egetive depending backdrops strategic indicative values.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 3, 1]}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1177. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1177. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 855 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 4, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    98 x 4 + 63 x 5 + 42 x 4 + 75 x 4 + 7 x 0\n    which is 1175 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1177. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I need a division strategy that maximizes my value and isn't worse than the outside offer. I'll keep all units of the high-value items (items 1 and 4) and most of item 2, given my high valuation on these:\n\n   - Proposed counteroffer: [0, 2, 5, 6, 1] (offering fewer high-value items to Player 2)\n\n   - Calculated value of my proposed counteroffer for my share:\n     - I would keep: [4, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n       - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 98 = 392\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 75 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n     - Total = 392 + 189 + 42 + 0 + 0 = 623\n\n   This is still below my outside offer, but I'm aiming to gauge Player 2's range since I'm still far from their valuation. As this is a hypothetical strategy towards getting closer to my outside offer in the final round if necessary:\n   - My actual decision is to continue the negotiation towards more advantageous terms.\n\n   Given my assessment, I should consider a more conservative offer while advancing negotiations during this round.\n\n   Therefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 5, 6, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1177. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 855 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 4, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    98 x 4 + 63 x 5 + 42 x 4 + 75 x 4 + 7 x 0\n    which is 1175 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1177. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 5, 6, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action, let's evaluate the current situation and offers step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 1177.\n   - My values for each item are: item 1 = 98, item 2 = 63, item 3 = 42, item 4 = 75, item 5 = 7.\n   - Total pool of items: 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n   - The discount factor does not apply in terms of influencing my decision directly now, as this is the last round. We will not be negotiating after this round ends.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - Value of the current offer [2, 3, 0, 1, 0]:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 42 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 75 = 75\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n     - Total value = 196 + 189 + 0 + 75 + 0 = 460\n\n   - This value (460) is lower than my outside offer value (1177).\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Should I accept the current offer? No, because its value is significantly lower than my outside offer.\n   - Should I walk away and take my outside offer? Since the current offer is worse than the outside offer, this is a reasonable option.\n   - Should I propose a specific counteroffer? To avoid proposal mistakes like offering a total lower than my outside offer, or equaling/worse offers than already made, I need to keep the total value at least equal to my outside offer.\n\nLet's create a possible valid counteroffer:\n- Keep at least the majority of high-value items (item 1 and item 4) to surpass the outside offer of 1177.\n\nIf I keep 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5, I can counter with:\n- Offer 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n\nCalculating my value for this counteroffer:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 98 = 392\n- 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 63 = 315\n- 6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 42 = 252\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 75 = 150\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n- Total value = 1109, which meets my requirement to be competitive with my outside offer of 1177 without going below it.\n\nTherefore, I would prefer to WALK since my highest calculated counter offer was 1109 which is less than 1177 outside offer value.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, I will analyze the current situation systematically following the steps and questions provided:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 1326.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 90 per unit\n  - Item 2: 97 per unit\n  - Item 3: 79 per unit\n  - Item 4: 58 per unit\n  - Item 5: 80 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 6 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 4 units\n- **Discount Factor**: In the first round, the discount factor does not yet reduce the value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer [1, 1, 3, 1, 2]**: Evaluate the total value of accepting the current offer:\n  - 1 unit of Item 1 = 1 x 90 = 90\n  - 1 unit of Item 2 = 1 x 97 = 97\n  - 3 units of Item 3 = 3 x 79 = 237\n  - 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 x 58 = 58\n  - 2 units of Item 5 = 2 x 80 = 160\n  - Total value = 90 + 97 + 237 + 58 + 160 = 642\n\n  The value of the current offer (642) is significantly less than my outside offer value of 1326.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffer**: I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a total value greater than my outside offer value of 1326.\n  - For instance, a potential counteroffer might be [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]. Let's calculate if it's beneficial:\n    - 2 units of Item 1 = 2 x 90 = 180\n    - 2 units of Item 2 = 2 x 97 = 194\n    - 6 units of Item 3 = 6 x 79 = 474\n    - 2 unit of Item 4 = 2 x 58 = 116\n    - 3 units of Item 5 = 3 x 80 = 240\n    - Total value = 180 + 194 + 474 + 116 + 240 = 1204\n\nEven this improved offer isn't quite reaching my outside offer, but I need to attempt to move toward a more favorable distribution.\n\n### Step 3: Decision\nThe current offer is much lower than my outside offer. A counteroffer must improve my position significantly, and the one example tested above still isn't better than the outside offer. Since this was not reaching the outside offer value, I will not accept or walk but propose a counteroffer closer to the possible maximum. I'll propose: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1].\n\nRecalculate for my own values with this proposal to the opponent:\n- Retain 3 units of Item 1 = 3 x 90 = 270\n- Retain 3 units of Item 2 = 3 x 97 = 291\n- Retain 6 units of Item 3 = 6 x 79 = 474\n- Retain 2 units of Item 4 = 2 x 58 = 116\n- Retain 3 units of Item 5 = 3 x 80 = 240\n- Total value = 270 + 291 + 474 + 116 + 240 = 1391\n\nThis gives me a total value of 1391, which is better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 404. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 404. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 567 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 0 + 24 x 1 + 61 x 5 + 11 x 1 + 21 x 3\n    which is 403 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 404. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 9 for item 1, 7 for item 2, 68 for item 3, 43 for item 4, 56 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 565. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 188. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 188. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 549 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 7 x 1 + 68 x 1 + 43 x 0 + 56 x 2\n    which is 187 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 188. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means the value of the outcome will decrease if the negotiation prolongs into future rounds. It's advantageous to secure a deal sooner rather than later if it meets my objectives.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer from Player 2.\n   - I will propose a counteroffer where the total value of the items I keep is greater than my outside offer of 188.\n\nLet's calculate the value of keeping different combinations of items:\n\nTo avoid Mistake 3 (offering no items or all items), I'll aim for balanced division:\n- Consider offering Player 2: [1, 2, 0, 3, 2]\n  - Which means I keep: [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n  \n  Calculating my value if I keep these:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 43 = 86\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n\n  Total value I receive = 9 + 14 + 136 + 86 + 56 = 301\n\nThis value (301) is greater than my outside offer of 188, making this a valid counteroffer where I avoid Mistake 2 (making an offer worse for me than my outside offer).\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - I will propose this counteroffer because it ensures my value is higher than my outside option and doesn't violate any of the mistakes mentioned.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 3, 2]}\n```",
